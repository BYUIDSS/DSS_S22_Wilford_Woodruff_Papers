[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|in-law]] until the 5th of July, and then
left for my native place, [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]],
where I arrived the third day after.
While tarrying at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house I
married my sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice Woodruff]] to
Mr. [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]]. At my sister's
marriage there were between forty and
fifty persons, mostly our relatives. This
was on the 4th of August, 1841.
A few days afterwards my aunt Bulah
Hart was baptized into the Church, and
on the 18th of the month I bade fare-
well to my father's house after a stay of
forty-one days. This was a longer visit
than I had paid to any of my friends for
the last ten years.
On the 9th of September, a little
company, consisting of myself, [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and
[[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|son]], and four others,started on board the
boat Sandusky for [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]]. Our ulti-
mate destination was [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], where we
arrived on the 5th of the next month.
When I left Nauvoo, two years before,
there were not more than a dozen houses
[Column 2]
in the place, but, on my return to the
city, there were several hundred.
We passed by the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]], then build-
ing, and had a view of it; we then
called at the house of Elder Brigham
Young, and there spent the night.
Brother Brigham was sick, and Heber
C. Kimball and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] were
with him. We laid hands upon him and
he soon recovered.
I saw many of my old friends and ac-
quaintances, and was informed that others
of them were dead.
I met with many friends on the day
after my return to Nauvoo, and also sat
in counsel with the Twelve and was
happy once more to meet with my
quorum. I moved my things to Elder
Kimball's. My wife and child were sick.
On the 30th of October the city coun-
cil met and among its business I was ap-
pointed one of the city council of
Nauvoo.

When I arrived there I was so very
lame and weary with my heavy load and
fast walking that I could scarcely walk
at all. I then took rail and arrived in
[[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] at 10 o'clock at night, but
was exceedingly lame and weary. I 
spent the night with Elder [[James Riley|James Riley]], 
24 Park Street.
I had now fairly ended my Hereford-
shire mission, and bidden a last farewell 
to that field of labor where the Lord had
blessed me beyond all my expectations.
I now left three conferences in the re-
gion which I opened one year before, on
the 5th of the same month that I left this 
vineyard, planted all over with churches, 
numbering fifteen hundred Saints.
The minutes which I have recorded 
will show at a glance the rise and pro-
gress of the churches in Herefordshire, 
and the regions around.
On Sunday, the 28th of March, the 
[[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]] conference met, and there 
were present of the Twelve, George A. 
Smith and Wilford Woodruff, with 1 
high priest, 13 elders, 28 priests, 10 
teachers, and 8 deacons. The confer-
ence was held in the Magistrate's Assem-
bly Room.
At the close of the conference it was
voted that "this conference grant unto 
Elders Woodruff and George A. Smith a 
letter of recommendation manifesting
that the Church in this region accept of 
their labors and consider that they have
filled their mission with honor and dig-
nity."
We had a very interesting time on this 
occasion. The conference was held in a
place which would hold 800 and it was 
crowded; but there was perfect order 
and much good feeling manifested dur-
ing the day. There was prospect of a
continued increase in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]].
George A. Smith was the president of 
the conference and [[Thomas Joseph Filcher|T. J. Fitcher]] and O.
Shaw, clerks.
Next day George A. Smith and my-
self met the officers in council at the
[[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]] Meeting Rooms and gave such
advise as we deemed wisdom, and then 
took our farewell.
On the following day we also parted 
from the Saints at [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]], took coach
to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]], and called upon Parley
P. Pratt, 47 Oxford Street, and found
him and his family enjoying good health.
On the 6th of April, 1841, the general
[Column 2]
conference of the British mission was
held in [[Carpenter's Hall, Manchester, Lancashire, England|Carpenter's Hall]], Manchester, at
which there were present nine of the
quorum of the Twelve, namely: Presi-
dent [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], 
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]], Parley P. Pratt, Orson
Pratt, [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]], Wilford Wood-
ruff, [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], and George A. Smith. 
The total members of the British mission 
at that time was represented as 5,814, and
800 besides had emigrated to America
under the shipping arrangements of the
Church. At this conference the Twelve
blessed and set apart Orson Hyde for his 
mission to [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] to which he had 
been called by the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]].
This was the first and only time in this 
dispensation that the Twelve Apostles sat 
in conference as a quorum in a foreign 
land.
Immediately after the general confer-
ence, those of the Twelve who were 
about to return home hastened to Liver-
pool and embarked for America on the 
20th of April, on board of the ship
Rochester. Next day, the wind being
favorable, the ship weighed anchor. 
There were on board Brigham Young, 
Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, George 
A. Smith, Wilford Woodruff, Willard 
Richards and John Taylor, of the Twelve, 
with Elder [[Reuben Hedlock|Reuben Hedlock]] and 120 of
the British Saints.
On our passage across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] we 
had some very tempestuous weather and 
became familiar with "a storm at sea."
On the 20th of May we landed in New 
York, and on the next day George A. 
Smith and myself took up our abode for 
a few days at Brother [[Lucian Rose Foster|Foster's]]. While 
here I met my brothers-in-law, [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra]] and 
[[Ilus Fabyan Carter|llus Carter]], and also Dr. [[Charles Fabyan|Charles Fabyan]], 
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife's]] relative.
On the 22nd of May, at the house of 
Brother Foster and in the presence of the 
quorum of the Twelve, I performed the 
service of marriage between Mr. Edward 
Ockey and Miss [[Eliza Brewer Ockey|Eliza Brewer]], both of 
them my converts of [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castle Frome]]. 
This was the first marriage ceremony at 
which I officiated.
On the 2nd of June I arrived at 
[[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] per stage, and was per-
mitted to embrace my wife, and also my 
first born [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|son]], whom I had not before
seen. After two years of separation
from my wife, it was a happy reunion 
indeed. Here I staged with my [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father-]]AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
through [[Great Malvern, Worcestershire, England|Great Malvern]] to [[Crowcutt, Worcestershire, England|Crowcat]]; I 
held a meeting at Brother [[George Brooks|George Brooks']]
and had an interesting time with a large 
number of Saints whom I had baptized 
about a year before. I went to [[Dunns Close, Herefordshire, England|Dunclose]] 
the day after, visiting many of the Saints
by the way, laying hands upon the sick, 
and blessing and counseling others of the
flock. They all were happy to see me, 
for I had baptized most of them when I 
first opened that field of labor. Next 
day we traveled to [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]], and 
visited the Saints by the way.
At Frome's Hill I met with the Saints 
on Sunday morning, and had a crowded 
house; in the afternoon we held a meet-
ing at [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley Hill]], where I communed 
with the church. At the close of the
meeting I had a busy time shaking hands 
with the Saints and parting from them. 
Many of them wished me to bless them,
and others to heal them. I spent the
night with Brother [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] at 
Elder [[Edward Ockey|Edward Ockey's]], and on the mor-
row we held the Frome's Hill conference
at Standley Hill.
There were present of the traveling 
high council, 2 high priests, 20 elders, 
30 priests, 9 teachers, and 2 deacons.
After calling the meeting to order, I 
moved that Elder Levi Richards should 
preside over the conference, and he was
sustained by the meeting. I was chosen 
clerk.
After singing and prayer, the presi-
dent called upon the officers for the rep-
resentation of the various branches, 
which was given as follows: branches, 
33; members, 957; elders, 24; priests, 
68; teachers, 27; deacons, 8.
[[Robert Gomery|Robert Gummery]], [[Edward Philips|Edward Philips]] and 
[[John Spiers|John Spires]] were ordained to the office
of elder, under the hands of Elders 
Richards, [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] and myself; Thomas
Bishop to the office of priest, and Wm. 
Rowley to the office of deacon.
In the afternoon, after speeches from
Elders Richards and Kington, I delivered 
my farewell address and pronounced the
benediction on the conference.
After the meeting was dismissed, I was
almost three hours shaking hands with
the Saints, healing the sick and giving 
counsel to the multitude who surrounded 
me, many of whom were in tears when 
we parted. Nearly fifty came to me to ask
me to take them to Zion, when I had not
means to take myself. I, however, gave
[Column 2]
Sister [[Mary Jenkins Foxall|Foxal]] five pounds to help her and 
her husband and children to the land of 
America. She had made every exertion 
for six months to save money to gather 
with the Saints, and had raised thirty 
pounds. The five pounds I gave to her
was a donation from Elder Edward 
Ockey, who was imparting of his sub-
stance to help the poor of the church to
gather.
After bidding the multitude of Saints
farewell, I went to Elder Ockey's, to 
spend the night, accompanied by Elders
Richards, Kington and [[William Kay|Ray]].
We had been in the house but a short 
time when three of Edward Ockey's 
brothers came in for the purpose of hav-
a contest, because their brother and sis-
ter had embraced the gospel and was
about to gather with the Saints. They 
manifested much wrath against me, and, 
after conversing with them about three 
hours, they left the house, and we were
once more in peace.
After conversing together until the
third watch of the night, we retired to 
rest, closing one of the busiest days of
my life.
I arose in the morning, refreshed by 
sleep, and, after conversing several hours 
with Elders Richards, Kington, Kay, 
Ockey and others, I was under the ne-
cessity of parting with the Saints in this 
region.
In bidding them farewell I found in 
our hearts and memory of our associa-
tion many ties which bound me to those
I were leaving behind and among the
faithful ones were the Ockeys.
Brother Edward Ockey and his sister 
[[Ann Ockey Powell|Ann]] were of a good and wealthy family. 
They had many trials to pass through to 
do the will of God and to gather with 
the Saints, for their brothers were exceed-
ingly set against them. But Brother 
Edward had maintained his integrity like
a man of God and was making every
preparation to gather with the Saints, but
his sister Ann had fears that her brothers 
would hinder her gathering.
Having bid farewell to the Saints of 
Standley Hill, I walked to Frome's Hill
and conversed with the elders until two 
o'clock, when I took the parting hands 
of Elders Richards, Kington, Ray and
others, and with my carpet bag with about 
20 pounds weight in it, walked fifteen 
miles to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] in four hours.TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
Hill and dined with Brother [[Edward Ockey|Ockey]], whom
I was truly glad to see once more. We 
went together through [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley Hill]] and
called upon the Saints. Six months had
passed since I had parted from the 
churches in this region, but now I was 
again in the field where the Lord by His 
blessing and the power of the Holy
Ghost had made my labors so abundantly
fruitful.
Next day I went to [[Greenway, Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Greenway]] and 
preached, blessed a child, confirmed a
member and administered the ordinance
of the Gospel to five sick persons; and
on the morrow continued to [[Turkey Hall, Eldersfield, Worcestershire, England|Turkey Hill]]. 
Here on the Sunday I communed with 
the saints and preached to a large con-
gregation upon the gathering. I found
the Saints in the region around very de-
sirous to gather to the body of the 
Church, but they were poor and had not
the means.
Conference at [[Gadfield Elm Chapel, Pendock, Worcestershire, England|Gadfield Elm Chapel]].â 
On the 15th day of March, 1841, the 
[[Brangreen, Newent, Gloucestershire, England|Bran Green]] and [[Gadfield Elm, Worcestershire, England|Gadfield Elm]] con-
ference again assembled, when the meet-
ing was called to order by Elder Wood-
ruff.
There were present one of the quorum 
of the Twelve Apostles, 1 high priest; 10 
elders 21 priests 6 teachers and 1
Deacon, besides the congregation of the
Saints. There were represented nineteen
churches; 367 members, 8 elders, 33 
priests, 11 teachers, 1 deacon, removed
41, died 1, expelled 2.
WILFORD WOODRUFF, President. 
[[John Hill|JOHN HILL]], Clerk.
We had a very interesting time at the 
conference and a large assembly of the 
Saints. It was the last time that I should 
attend in that part of my old and beloved 
field of labor, during my present mission
to England, and whether or not I should 
ever meet here in a conference assembly 
of Saints again was one of the secrets of 
my future life for time to reveal. We 
had held our meeting without disturbance
from the mob who were present, for
they were kept quiet by the police in at-
tendance who were in disguise.
No sooner had the meeting closed than
multitudes of the Saints crowded around
me and hands were presented me on 
every side, to bid me farewell. Many
called for me to bless them before I de-
parted. Others cried out, "Lay hands
upon me and heal me before you go."
[Column 2]
One came with, "Brother Woodruff, I am 
turned out of doors for my religion; 
what shall I do?'' Another with, "I am 
ready to go to Zion, but my wife won't go 
with me; shall I leave her to gather with
the Saints?" A wife in turn says, "My 
husband beat me and turned me out of 
doors because I have been baptized. I 
have money enough to carry me and the
children to Zion; will you let me go with-
out him?" "Brother Woodruff, my 
mother is over 80 years of age and has 
willed me 60 pounds at her death, but 
will not emigrate with me; must I stay 
for her to die or leave her now to go with 
the Saints?" One said, "I have sold 
my little place and shall have 30 pounds 
to-morrow, but must go out into the
street. I have not enough to carry my
family to America; can you help me to a 
few pounds or tell me what to do?" And
an Elder cried out, "How much longer 
must I preach in England before you will
let me go to America?" "Brother Wood-
ruff, would you come and preach in Chel-
tenham?" "My head is in great pain, 
would you heal me? " "I want you to 
consecrate this bottle of oil before you
go?" "Will you write to me?" "I 
have been waiting a long time to get a 
chance to speak to you; good by, remem-
ber me to Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]], good by! God 
bless you!''
Thus was I for more than an hour after 
the close of the meeting assailed with 
the affectionate outbursts and adieus and 
a host of perplexities of these Saints who
crowded around me as children to their
father.
Many of the Saints parted from me
in tears and many followed me to 
Turkey Hill where I spent the night and 
they filled the house until a late hour, 
begging counsel and instruction of me.
One of these was a Baptist minister who 
had just been baptized into the Church.
On the morrow, in company with El-
der [[John Needham|Needham]], I walked to Keysend 
Street, where I preached to a crowded 
congregation of Saints. On the follow-
ing day I walked to [[Wind Point, Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Wind Point]], where
I visited the Saints, and thence con-
tinued to [[Colwall, Herefordshire, England|Colwall]]. Here I met with a
large congregation of Saints and 
preached to them upon the gathering.
Next day, with Elder [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]], I 
walked over [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]] and called 
upon Elder [[Samuel Jones, b. 1822|Samuel Jones]]; thenceAUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
time in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] before my return to
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. Next day I parted from Lor-
enzo Snow and the London Saints and 
took train for [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]], to visit the branch 
which had been raised up there by my
convert Elder [[Thomas Kington|Thomas Kington]], who it 
will be remembered was the superin-
tendent of the [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]] Circuit of
United Brethren.
Leaving Bristol I visited the churches
which I had raised up, for the purpose of 
holding conferences and bidding farewell
to the Saints, hundreds of whom I had 
myself baptized.
When I arrived at [[Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales|Monmouth]], Elder 
[[James George Morgan|James Morgan]] was waiting my coming, 
and had given out an appointment for
me to preach in the town at 7 o'clock, at
the house of [[Robert Houston Davis|Robert Davis]]. There was a 
crowded meeting and many could not get
into the house. Four offered themselves
for baptism. The Spirit witnessed to me
that there would many embrace the Gos-
pel in Monmouthshire, and I said, "the
harvest is great and the laborers few."
I arose in the morning refreshed by
sleep, and having taken breakfast with 
Mr. [[Mr. Maston|Matton]], I walked ten miles through
mud and water in a driving March rain
storm to sister [[Mary Morgan|Mary Morgan]] at Little
Garway, where I found a pleasant family 
of the Saints. We were drenched with 
rain but found a good fire and spent the
day comfortably and in the evening I had
an interesting interview with Elder Little-
wood; the next day at Sister Morgan's, 
reading the history of [[Rome, Latzio, Italy|Rome]], with much
interest, and in the evening I met the 
officers of the Church there in council and 
had a good time. Sunday I preached in
the morning at the house of Brother
[[Thomas Rook|Thomas Rood]], and in the evening at the
Kitchen upon the Book of Mormon, and 
had the place full.
The Garway Conference, held March 
8th, 1841âI met the Garway conference
at the Kitchen. Elder [[Levi Richards|Levi Richards]] was
chosen president and Elder James Mor-
gan, clerk. There were present one of 
the Quorum of the Twelve, one High 
Priest, seven Elders, eleven Priests, two
Teachers and one Deacon. The meeting 
opened with prayer by Elder Woodruff, 
after which the churches were represented
as follows: Members, 134; Elders, 4;
Priests, 5; Teachers, 3; Deacons, 1.
After the representation it was moved 
that [[John Needham|John Needham]] be ordained elder,
[Column 2]
[[William Morris, bap. pre 1840|William Morris]] priest and [[Thomas Rough|Thomas Rough]]
teacher. These were ordained under the 
hands of Elders Woodruff and Richards.
The meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock and
one person was baptized.
In the afternoon Elder Levi Richards 
spoke and I followed him. After meet-
ing the Saints contributed one pound to 
help me, and sold them three books of 
Mormon and fifty addresses to the citi-
zens of London. I then walked five 
miles with Brother Richards to Brother 
[[John Holley|Holley's]] and spent the night. This was 
the first time I had seen Brother Levi for 
about two years.
Next day in company of Elders Levi
Richards and [[Thomas Pitt|Thomas Pitt]] I walked to 
the city of [[Hereford, Herefordshire, England|Hereford]], where Elder [[William Kay|Ray]] 
and others had been preaching.
On Sunday a preacher arose before two 
or three thousand people in the market
house and informed the multitude that
he had a fresh letter direct from America, 
showing the origin of the Book of Mor-
mon. So he read the old Spaulding
story. When he got through Elder Levi 
Richards arose and informed the people
that instead of its being a new story it
had been published for seven years 
throughout the United States and in
England. This caused a great uproar, for 
while some were for driving the man out
of the place for lying, others were crowding
around Elders Richards and Ray to hear 
them preach. The crowd, however, was so 
excited that they left the ground with 
hundreds following them. There never 
was a time when the people were so much
stirred up and eager to hear the Latter-
day Saints as at the present, and it was
expected that we should not get through
the city without having crowds around
us. We did, however, and had a view of 
Hereford Cathedral as we passed along 
and reached Sister Bufton's.
There was at this time a small branch
of the Church at Hereford, numbering
seven members. We parted from Brother
Pitt at Hereford, and continued to Lug-
wardine, where I met with the Church for
the last time and preached from the 24th 
of Isaiah.
On the morrow I walked to Shucknell 
Hill and had an interesting meeting with
the Saints and preached upon the gather-
ing to Zion and Jerusalem. It was my
last meeting with them and I bid them
farewell. Next day I walked to [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley]] TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.

MINUTES
of the First [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] Conference, held at
the [[Barrett's Academy, London, Middlesex, England|Academy]], 57 King's Square, Goswell
Road, February 14th, 1841.
There were present of officers of the 
Church, Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]], Wilford 
Woodruff, [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] and [[William Hill Pitt|Wm. Pitt]],
besides 4 priests.
The meeting was called to order by 
Elder H. C. Kimball, at 2 o'clock p. m.,
Sunday, the 14th of February, 1841, 
when it was moved by Elder Kimball, 
and seconded by Elder Pitt, that Wilford 
Woodruff be the president of the Con-
ference.
Moved by Elder Kimball and seconded 
by Elder Woodruff, that Dr. Wm. Cope-
land be the clerk. Carried unanimously.
The meeting was then opened by sing-
ing, and prayer from Elder Kimball.
The president then called for the 
representation of the branches of the
London Conference.
The Church at [[Bedford, Bedfordshire, England|Bedford]] was represented 
by Priest [[Robert Williams|Robert Williams]], containing 
42 members and one priest; seven re-
moved, and two dead.
The Church at [[Ipswich, Suffolk, England|Ipswich]], represented 
by Elder Wm. Pitt, consisted of 12 
members, 1 elder, 1 priest and 1 teacher.
The Church at [[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]], represented
by Priest [[John Griffiths|John Griffith]], consisted of 6 
members and 1 priest.
The Church at London, represented 
by H. C. Kimball, consisted of 46 mem-
bers, 1 elder and 2 priests. Excellent 
prospect of continued increase.
ORDINATIONS.
Moved and seconded by Elders Kim-
ball and Woodruff, that [[James Albon|James Albon]] be
ordained an elder; moved and seconded
by Elders Kimball and Snow, that 
[[Thomas Barnes|Thomas Barnes]] be ordained a teacher;

and Pitt, that Robert Williams be or-
dained an elder to oversee the Church at 
Bedford; moved and seconded by Elders 
Robert Williams and Pitt, that Wm. 
Smith, at Bedford, be ordained a priest;

the hands of Elders Kimball, Woodruff 
and Snow.
Afterward Elder Kimball moved and 
Elder Woodruff seconded that Elder 
Lorenzo Snow be appointed president of
this Conference and to lake the superin-
tendency of the Church in London.
Much valuable instruction was given 
by Elders Kimball and Woodruff in re-
lation to the duties of official members, 
and afterward it was moved by Elder
Kimball and seconded by Elder Snow 
that this Conference be adjourned till 
Sunday the 16th of May, 1841; after 
which the Conference closed.
WILFORD WOODRUFF, President.
DR. WM. COPELAND, Clerk.
During this Conference meeting we 
also broke bread with the Saints and con-
firmed four. At half-past 6 in the evening, 
we met again and had the largest con-
gregation which had assembled at our 
preaching place. One came forward for
baptism.
This was a day which we had long de-
sired to see, for we had labored exceed
ingly hard to establish a Church in Lon-
don and at times it seemed as though we
should have to give it up, but by holding 
on to the work of our Divine Master and 
claiming the promises of God, we were 
now to leave an established London Con-
ference with a prosperous Church planted
in the metropolis, under the care of our 
beloved Brother Lorenzo Snow.
Brother Kimball, on the 15th, received
a letter from his [[Vilate Murray Kimball|wife]], informing us that
the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] had written for the 
Twelve to come immediately home.
At this time there was a prospect of 
war between America and England, over 
the imprisonment of McCloud, a British
officer, by the State of [[New York|New York]], and 
the northeastern boundary question. 
In consequence of this prospect the 
Prophet Joseph wrote for the Twelve to 
come home, after first thoroughly organ-
izing the British mission and calling out 
a number of native elders to send in
every direction throughout [[Great Britain|Great Britain]].
I spent the 25th of February in visit-
ing the Saints previous to my departure 
and in the evening preached for the last AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
[[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]], [[Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England|Gloucester]], [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|Cheltenham]], 
[[Oxford, Oxfordshire, England|Oxford]], [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. Traveled 4,469 miles; 
held 230 meetings, and established 53
places for preaching; I planted 47 
churches and jointly organized them.
These churches were chiefly comprised
in the two conferences raised up in Here-
fordshire, consisting of about 1,500 
Saints, 28 elders, no priests, 24 teachers, 
and 10 deacons.
The baptisms of the year were three 
hundred and thirty-six persons under my 
own hands, and I assisted in the baptism
of eighty-six others. I baptized 57 
preachers, mostly of the connection of 
the United Brethren, and also 2 clerks of
the Church of England. I confirmed 
420, and assisted in confirming 50 others.
I ordained 18 elders, 97 priests, 34 
teachers and 1 deacon. I blessed 120 
children, and administered to 120 sick 
by prayer, anointing and the laying on 
of hands, and in many instances the 
sick were healed, and devils cast out. I 
assisted in procuring Â£1,000 for the pub-
lication of 3,000 copies of the hymn 
book, 5,000 copies of the Book of Mor-
mon, and for the printing of the Mil-
lennial Star, and to assist two hundred
Saints to emigrate to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. I wrote 
200 letters and received 112.
The new year, 1841, found Elder 
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] and myself in the metropolis of 
England in the enjoyment of good 
health. We celebrated New Year's day
by baptizing two into the fold of Christ. 
The church in London now numbered
twenty-one members.
The next Sunday we held a meeting in
the [[Barrett's Academy, London, Middlesex, England|Academy]], confirmed two, and par-
took of the sacrament.
During the week I baptized the 
daughter of the Rev. [[James Albon|James Albon]], and 
the day after Elder Kimball started to 
[[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]] to break up new ground. On
the Sunday he preached there for the 
first time, when four persons offered 
themselves for baptism. Next day they
came to London, and we immediately 
repaired to our private bath in Taber-
nacle Square, and Elder Kimball bap-
tized five persons, one of whom was Dr. 
[[William Copeland|Wm. Copeland]].
This was indeed an interesting occa-
sion and we felt thankful to God to see
the cloud beginning to break, for we had 
struggled hard to do the little which had 
been done.
[Column 2]
On the 15th of the month we baptized 
three more of Brother Morgan's house-
hold, and on the following Sunday I 
preached to a full house and to many
new hearers. Several offered themselves 
for baptism, and there had been during 
the week added unto the Church seven 
souls.
Next day Elder Kimball received a 
letter from Elder [[Brigham Young|Young]], who wished us
to be ready to set sail for home early in 
April.
Several days later I baptized the Rev. 
James Albon and Mr. [[Brother Hender|Hender]], and be-
fore the close of January I baptized three
others into the Church.
I visited [[Greenwich, Kent, England|Greenwich]] and Woolwich, 
where Elder Kimball had raised up a 
small branch of the Church. I returned
to London with Elder Kimball. On the 
Sunday we communed with the Saints,
and in the evening we both preached to
a full congregation.
On the 8th of February, having re-
ceived a package of twenty Books of 
Mormon and two dozen hymn books.
Heber C. Kimball and myself went to 
Stationer's Hall and secured the copy-
right of the Book of Mormon in the 
name of [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith, Jr.]] We left five 
copies of the book, and paid three shil-
lings for the copyright.
In the evening we baptized four per-
sons, one of whom was the [[Mary Ann Eacock Albon|wife]] of Rev. 
James Albon, who had already received 
the Gospel.
Elder Brigham Young, per letter, in-
formed us of the large emigration of
that season. There were to go on one 
ship 235, and on another 100.
To the reader acquainted with the im-
mense emigrations of the Saints in later 
years, our consideration of the sailing of 
three or four hundred as a large emigra-
tion will be noteworthy.
Elder [[Lorenzo Snow|Lorenzo Snow]] arrived in Lon-
don on the 11th, to take charge of the 
Church after our departure. I was truly
glad to once more greet him for I had 
not seen him since 1837.
On the same day Elder [[William Hill Pitt|Wm. Pitt]] also 
arrived at our lodgings, and we had an
interesting meeting in the evening. 
Brother Snow preached, and Elder Kim-
ball and myself followed him, and the 
next day Brothers Heber and Lorenzo 
went to Woolwich to give impetus to TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
[[Barrett's Academy, London, Middlesex, England|Academy]], at which there were about fifty
present. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] preached.
An Independent minister invited me
home to take tea with him. I accepted 
his invitation, had an interesting time
and preached the Gospel to him and he
received my testimony and offered me his
chapel, which would hold 800. He said he
thought he would be baptized and would
try and get his society to do the same.
We met again in the evening and had 
more at our meeting than ever before.
Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] preached and 
was followed by Brothers Kimball, Wil-
liams, [[Henry C. Corner|Corner]], Hulme and myself.
We had a very interesting time and 
one offered himself for baptism. There
were some of the Aikenites present, one 
of whom purchased a hymn book. They 
wished us to call upon them and thought
they would be baptized. We then met 
at Father Corner's and communed with
the Saints and had a good time.
I rejoiced at the prospect which was 
opening before us, for we labored a long 
time and the work had gone slow, but 
now a wide opening was being made to 
roll on the work of the Lord in the me-
tropolis of England.
Having spent about ten days in Lon-
don President Young left for [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|Cheltenham]].
On the same day I visited Mr. James 
Albon, a minister of the Independent
order, who with his household believed 
our doctrine, and on the Sunday we found 
more than ever an interest being awak-
ened in London, and our prayer meeting
the next evening was attended by the 
Reverend James Albon, who received our 
testimony. We walked home with him 
and found his household growing in the 
faith and ready for the work of the Lord.
Two days after in the evening we bap-
tized four, two of whom were Mr. and
Mrs Morgan, with whom we lodged, 
[[Christopher Smith|Christopher, Smith]] their apprentice, and
[[Henry Corner Jr.|Henry Corner, Jun.]]
The afternoon of the following day
Dr. [[William Copeland|Copeland]] spent with us, and he re-
ceived our testimony, and in the evening 
we preached at our meeting place.
I had visited the Rev. James Albon 
several times and given him an account 
of the rise and progress of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
He believed in our mission and offered 
me his chapel to preach in, which would 
seat about a thousand.
[Column 2]
Sunday morning we accompanied our 
reverend friend and convert to his chapel
and were introduced to the committee, 
one of whom was a preacher who had
traveled much in [[Russia|Russia]] and other parts 
of the world. At the close of the meet-
ing the Rev. James Albon gave out an 
appointment for us to preach on the next 
Sabbath evening.
In the afternoon we met with the
Saints, confirmed four and had a full 
house, and in the evening we preached
again and a good feeling prevailed.
After meeting the Rev. James Albon 
called upon us at our room and told us 
that he had given out our appointment
to preach in his chapel and had informed
his congregation that he was a Latter-day 
Saint, and should be baptized and join 
our Church, and that they need not
longer consider him a member of their 
body unless they with him joined the
Saints. He told us this made a division 
among the committee; some were for 
going with him and some against follow-
ing their pastor into the true fold which 
he had found.
The Sunday following in the evening 
we preached, by the appointment of its
minister, in the Independent chapel to
the largest congregation we had ever dis-
coursed before in London. There were  
present priests and people of many de-
nominations. I addressed them for
about the space of one hour. A Wes-
leyan minister arose and opposed me,
which had a good effect, for the congre-
gation seeing the spirit he was of turned 
against him, and the committee refused 
him the permission to speak there any 
more. I was much bound by the oppos-
ing spirit, still the conduct of the enemy 
gave us friends.
The next evening we attended what 
was said to have been the largest temper-
ance meeting ever held in London, and 
the next two days brought us to the
close of the year.

and "the restitution of all things'' spoken
of by all the holy prophets, will be among 
the subjects illustrated.

ney & Seryngour.) 
The following Sunday we preached for
the first time in Barrett's Academy at
3 o'clock. There were present about 
fifty persons, unto whom I preached and 
Elder Smith preached in the evening; 
but it was the hardest matter to awaken
an interest upon the subject that I had 
ever found.
Next day I received a package of letters
from America, one from my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] an-
nouncing the death of my little daughter,
[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]].
There is so much going on in this great 
modern Babylon to draw the attention of 
the people that it seemed almost to re-
quire the trumpet's blast from heaven to 
awaken the attention of the inhabitants
to our proclamation of the restoration of 
the fullness of the Gospel.
We were here like the Apostles of old
without purse or script to warn the City
of London, where we had to pay high
for everything we required, and to pay
for a place to preach in. We were at
this time about out of money, but still
we felt to trust in God.
[Column 2]
November 1st I preached in the after-
noon in the Academy to about thirty, 
and in the evening to about fifty. We 
broke bread unto the Saints, and this
evening there seemed to be some interest 
manifested in inquiring into the work.
We preached again on the following 
Sunday. During the week we received
counsel from our brethren of the Twelve
for George A. Smith to go immediately
to the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] and spend his time with 
the churches there. After his departure
I felt very lonely for several days, but
Elder [[William Hill Pitt|William Pitt]] from [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] came 
and labored with me for a short time,
after which he took a mission to [[Ipswich, Suffolk, England|Ipswich]].
Brother Hulme, a captain of one of 
the "Pickford's Boats" on the London 
Canal, was present at my next preaching
after the departure of Elder Pitt, and 
with him were two of his hands whom
he had baptized. On the following day
I dined with him and the two brethren
on board their boat.
On the afternoon and evening of Sun-
day, the 22nd of October, I held public
meeting at the Academy, when four 
offered themselves for baptism; and on
the following Sunday I again preached
twice and baptized and confirmed three
more. These were the first fruits of my
labors in London.
Next day I took a very interesting
walk with Dr. [[William Copeland|Wm. Copeland]] through 
every part of the College of Surgeons at
[[Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, Middlesex, England|Lincoln's Inn Fields]], and on my return
home I was soon joined by Elders Brig-
ham Young and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]], who had come 
to spend a week or two in London. This 
was the first time ever President Brigham
Young was in the metropolis of Eng-
land.
We met for service at the Academy 
Wednesday evening, when Brother Brig-
ham preached, followed by Brother 
Heber. We had a good time.
In company with Presidents Young 
and Kimball on the 3rd of December I 
visited the [[Tower of London, London, Middlesex, England|Tower of London]], without 
seeing which the traveler would lose a 
capital page of the history of his travels
in [[Europe|Europe]], and during the week also 
visited [[St. Paul's Cathedral, London, Middlesex, England|St. Paul's]], [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]],
[[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]], the Queen's stables, 
and saw many other noted sights of 
London.
Sunday we held public meeting at the TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.

CHAPTER III.
CONTINUATION OF MY MISSION TO ENG-
LAND. ORGANIZATION OF THE LON-
DON CONFERENCE. I BID FAREWELL
TO THE [[Herefordshire, England|HEREFORDSHIRE]] SAINTS. 
RETURN TO AMERICA.
On the 6th of October, 1840, a 
general conference of the British mission 
was held at [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]. There were 
present of the Twelve Apostles, Brigham 
Young, [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], Willard Rich-
ards, [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] and 
Wilford Woodruff. The presiding officers 
of the mission represented twenty-seven
conferences, besides other churches not
yet organized into conferences. The
number of membership was 3,621, being 
an increase since the last general con-
ference of 1,113 members.
The next evening we attended a dis-
cussion held between a sectarian minister 
and Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]] on the subject 
of the Book of Mormon. There were 
present 1,500 people. This was the first 
discussion of any note on Mormonism
held in [[Great Britain|Great Britain]].
I left Manchester on the 14th of October
to return to my labors in London; and 
on my way, with Elder Alfred Cordon,
I visited the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]] and 
[[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]. On the 17th I arrived in 
London, where I found Elder George A.
Smith, and we were glad to meet each 
other once again.
We hired lodgings, board and sitting 
room at No. 40 Ironmonger Row, St. 
Luke's. Everything was dear, and we 
found with the greatest economy we 
could not do with much less than a pound 
per week each. What few Saints there 
were in London were very poor and
[Column 2]
unable to assist us. Most of the means 
used in my labors in London was sup-
plied by my converts of Herefordshire.
The prospect in London at that time 
was the darkest I had ever been in since
entering the vineyard, but the Lord was
with us and we were not discouraged.
Sunday we met with the Saints at 
Brother [[Henry C. Corner|Corner's]] three times, read in the 
Book of Mormon, gave instruction and
broke bread unto them. We had a good 
time, though there was only about half 
a dozen present. I felt the spirit bear
testimony that there would be a work
done in London.
I fell asleep, having retired to rest in 
good season, and slept until midnight,
when I awoke and meditated upon the
things of God until 3 o'clock in the morn-
ing, and while forming a determination
to warn the people in London and over-
come the power of darkness by the assist-
ance of God, a person appeared unto me 
whom I consider was the prince of dark-
ness. He made war upon me and at-
tempted to take my life. He caught me by 
the throat and nearly choked me to death.
He wounded me in my forehead and I 
also wounded him in a number of places
in the head. As he was about to over-
come me I prayed to the Father in the 
name of Jesus Christ for help. I then
had power over him and he left me,
though much wounded. Afterwards
three persons dressed in white came to 
me and prayed with me and I was im-
mediately healed of all my wounds and
delivered of all my troubles.
During the following week we visited
the [[British Museum, London, Middlesex, England|British Museum]] and other notable
places, and also attended a Wesleyan 
Methodist mission meeting over which
the Lord Mayor presided; while in the [Column 1]
churches on the Sabbath, while around
them on every hand they had seen forty
branches of two organized conferences 
of the Church of Latter-day Saints 
spring up in about six months, with over
a thousand members and between one 
and two hundred officers ordained to
scatter the seed of the Gospel every-
where in this prolific field.
On the 25th, I again took leave of the 
Saints in my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] field of labor
[Column 2]
to attend the conference at [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]], 
which was held at [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]].
The day after the conference I bap-
tized one and preached at [[Tunstall, Staffordshire, England|Tunstell]], and 
on the next evening at [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] to a 
crowded audience, and the power of
God rested upon me. Great solemnity 
pervaded the congregation. The Spirit 
of God was moving the people and they
felt that the Lord was doing a work in
their midst.
-[TO BE CONTINUED.]-TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE

brethren and friends in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] to re-
turn to [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]].
We had spent twenty-three days in 
that great Babylon of modern times and 
had found it harder to establish the 
Church there than in any place where
we had ever been. We had baptized
one man, and ordained him a priest; 
and six others had given in their names
to be baptized on the following Sunday; 
and at this time there was some little 
prospect of the Rev. [[Robert Aitken|Robert Aitken]] re-
ceiving the work. I, therefore, left 
London feeling that our mission and
labors had not been altogether in vain.
I was rejoiced on my return to the 
churches to find that the work was uni-
versally and rapidly progressing in Here-
fordshire. In some cases it was even 
reaching the nobility, and a lady of 
title had become convinced of the work 
of God through our ministry.
[[Lady Roberts|Lady Roberts]] was of the nobility of 
England and a lady of wealth, and had 
withdrawn from the Church of England 
and had traveled much in search of truth
looking for the fulfillment of the Pro-
phets.
She became acquainted with the ful-
ness of the Gospel through a female
servant in the employ of Squire Dowds-
well. She began to investigate the sub-
ject; the Spirit of God rested upon her
and convinced her of the truth of the 
work. She obtained the four numbers 
published of the Millennial Star, and, 
fearing that she should not be able to 
obtain them for herself, copied the 
whole of them with her pen. She also 
read the Book of Mormon and copied a 
part of that, and became perfectly con-
vinced of the truth of the work of 
which she read, and said she would go a
thousand miles but what she would see 
some of the Twelve and be baptized 
under their hands. Hearing that I was 
in London she was about to take a 
journey there to see me, and the other
brethren, and be baptized. She had 
two brothers, ministers of the Church of 
England.
On the 21st of September, 1840, we 
held the [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]] Conference, at 
which were represented 24 churches, 
with 754 members: 14 elders, 51 priests,
9 teachers and 1 deacon. The Bran 
Green and Frome's Hill Conferences
were now composed of 40 churches,
[Column 2]
1,007 members: 19 elders, 78 priests, 
15 teachers and one deacon.
These two conferences, with their
forty branch churches, and over a thou-
sand organized members, under the di-
rection of one hundred and thirteen 
ordained officers, had been raised up
within six months and a half. Surely
the work of God had been marvelous, 
unparalleled perhaps in the history of
any new religious movement.
I meditated upon these things, and in 
my journal of date September 21st, 
1840, I wrote thus:
"This has been a busy day with me.
After standing upon my feet from morn-
ing till evening I am called to shake 
hands with hundreds of Saints with glad
hearts and cheerful countenances. It is 
with no ordinary feelings that I meditate 
upon the cheering fact that a thousand 
souls have been baptized into the new
and everlasting covenant in about half a 
year in one field which God has enabled
me to open. I pray him to accept the
gratitude of my heart for his mercies 
and blessings unto me in this thing, and
enable me to stand with these Saints
and all the righteous in His celestial 
kingdom."
This day I had stood upon my feet 
eight hours in conference, conversed 
much of the time in suggesting, speak-
ing, motioning, etc.; ordained about
thirty, confirmed some, healed many 
who were sick, shook hands with about
four hundred Saints, walked two miles,
and ended with about four hours chim-
ney corner preaching. I then laid down
to rest and dreamt of catching fish.
The church ministers at this time were 
very much stirred up in this region be-
cause of the success of the work of God
in the midst of the people, and every 
exertion was made by them to stay its
progress. They were finding that the 
Lord was delivering their flocks out of
their hands and giving them unto the 
shepherds of the Church of the Saints. 
They were alarmed and were holding 
conventions and meetings to contrive
plans and adopt means to overthrow the
latter-day work of God, which they un-
derstood not, and believed not, yet 
feared its power. And well indeed they
might, for in some instances they did 
not have more than ten or fifteen at their AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
heard, and they wished [[Heber Chase Kimball|him]] to speak to 
them again. He did so and addressed
them at considerable length, and after-
ward several invited him home to their 
houses.
While he was away a man who had 
been a preacher came to Mr. [[Henry C. Corner|Corner's]]; 
I gave him a brief account of the great 
work of God in the last days and they 
received the things which I spake unto
them. Mr. Corner offered himself for 
baptism. This was the first man in the 
city of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] who offered himself for
the ordinance of the Gospel. We ap-
pointed the next evening to administer
the ordinance of baptism unto him.
After supping with him we returned 
home. I was weary and unwell during
the night, but felt thankful unto the 
Lord for the privilege of preaching to
the inhabitants of this great city and to
have gained one soul as a seal to our 
ministry.
On the 31st of August we reaped the 
first fruits of our labors and laid the first 
living stone of the Church of Jesus Christ
in England's great metropolis.
We walked into the city and called 
upon Mr. Corner, who went forward
with us to the public baths and received
the initiatory ordinance of the Gospel.
He was baptized by Brother Kimball.
Returning to the house of Brother
Corner, Elders Kimball, [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] and my-
self laid our hands upon his head and
confirmed him a member or the Church. 
We returned to our homes that night, 
thankful unto God for his goodness in
blessing our labors even thus much.
On the 2nd of September I was quite
ill. I had been unwell for several days, 
but now I was obliged to keep to my 
room; but Elders Kimball and Smith 
went into the city to visit the people and 
found some who hearkened to them favor-
ably. We had by this time found that 
London was the hardest place for a mis-
sion that we had ever undertaken, but 
we did not feel discouraged in the least, 
and were determined in the name of the
Lord to set up the standard of the King-
dom in that city.
The following day I was still confined
to my room most of the time, but on
the next, Elders Kimball and Smith went 
to [[Deptford, London, Middlesex, England|Debtford]], and I took a walk into the 
city, called upon Brother Corner and 
found him in good spirits. I also called
[Column 2]
upon Mr. Panther, 17 Warf, City Road,
Basin, who was a director of a Methodist
chapel. I asked him for the chapel to 
preach in. He said he had a school 
house which would hold two hundred, 
and that I might have that on Sunday. 
So I gave out an appointment at Bowl 
Court, 137 Shordeitch. I conversed 
with several others who received my tes-
timony, and one woman said she would
be baptized.
Sunday, September the 6th, I preached 
in the morning at Bowl Court, 137
Shoreditch, and was followed by Elders
Kimball and Smith. We also held a 
meeting in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]], at 3 
o'clock in the afternoon, at which Elders
Kimball and Smith preached and I bore 
my testimony to their words. One man 
arose and opposed us, and was angry be-
cause of the truth of God. He continued 
opposing, until the police stopped the 
conversation.
We met again in the evening at Bowl 
Court, to preach to the people, but 
when we got there we found a plan con-
trived by several of the preachers for 
one of them to preach, lest some should 
believe our testimony. We went our 
way and found four persons who re-
ceived our testimony and offered them-
selves for baptism.
Next day I wrote to Elder [[Daniel Browett|Browett]] of 
my [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] field of labor, and 
walked to Brother Corner's and visited 
several other friends. Two offered them-
selves for baptism. I visited [[St. Paul's Cathedral, London, Middlesex, England|St. Paul's]] 
and then returned home. Elders Kim-
ball and Smith had just returned from a
visit to the Rev. [[Robert Aitken|Robert Aitken]]. He 
received them kindly, acknowledged
their doctrine true, but was afraid of 
deception. His mind was in a disturbed 
state.
In the evening we held a meeting in
the [[Temperance Hall, London, Middlesex, England|Temperance Hall]]; but we had al-
most the bare walls to preach to, there 
being only about thirty present. I 
preached to the few present for about an
hour, and Elder Kimball followed me. 
After paying seven shillings and six 
pence for the use of the hall we returned 
to our lodgings.
On September the 9th I paid my bills 
and called upon the friends, in company 
of Brothers Kimball and Smith, and on
the day following I parted from the TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
speech. On the following day, we
started out to try to get some doors 
opened for preaching. Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]]
went to one part of the [[London, Middlesex, England|city]] and Brother
[[George Albert Smith|Smith]] and myself to another. We called 
upon two Baptist ministers and asked 
one for his chapel. In the evening we 
attended a Methodist meeting in Long 
Lane.
Next day we again went to the Tem-
perance Hall, in St. George's Road near 
the Elephant and Castle, and by the re-
request of the committee I addressed the
meeting upon the subject of temperance,
followed by George A Smith. We gave
out an appointment to preach the Gos-
pel at that place September 7th.
The day after, we all started out to go
through the city of London to see if we 
could find a man with the Spirit of God,
and after wandering through the city, 
not knowing whither we went, we came
upon a man and stopped him and spoke
to him. Brother Kimball asked him
if he was a preacher? He said 
he was. He seemed to have a good 
spirit, and informed us that he had been
to America, and had come to London
for the purpose of going to South Aus-
tralia, but had just buried one child and 
another lay at the point of death. Broth-
er Kimball told him his child should 
live. He gave us some information 
where we could preach. On the same
day we called upon him and found his 
child better, but he was not at home. 
We then went and heard a Calvinist 
preach, and he gave us an invitation to
call and see him.
Next day we again went over the city
to see if we could find any of the chil-
dren of God. We found one man and 
his household who received our testi-
mony, and he opened his doors for us to 
preach. We appointed a meeting at his 
house for Sunday evening. His name 
was [[Henry C. Corner|Corner]], and he lived at 52 Iron-
monger Row, St. Luke's Parish, near
the church.
We had spent twelve days in going to 
and fro through London, trying to find
a people willing to receive our testi-
mony, but finding the doors shut against 
us, we determined in the name of God 
to go into the streets and lift up our
voices.
Accordingly, Elders Kimball, Smith, 
and myself started out on Sunday morn-
[Column 2]
ing, August the 30th, walked three miles 
and stopped in [[Tabernacle Square, London, Middlesex, England|Tabernacle Square]], Old 
Street, where we found an Aitkenite 
preaching to the people, who was fol-
lowed by a Presbyterian. Just as the 
latter was about to begin, Elder Kimball
informed him that there was a preacher
from America present who would like to
speak when he got through. The preacher 
then informed the people that there was 
an American minister present, and pro-
posed that he should speak first. Elder 
George A. Smith then got into the chair,
and spoke about twenty minutes, and
then the Presbyterian spoke. George A.
had informed the people that there were
two other American preachers present 
who would like to address them, and, 
when the Presbyterian closed, Elder 
Kimball asked him if there would be any 
objection to our preaching there at three
o'clock. He answered, "No, not at all. 
What denomination do you belong to?'' 
"To the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-
ter-day Saints," was the reply.
"Oh, I have heard of them," he said.
"They are a bad people; they have done 
much hurt; they divide churches; we 
don't want to hear you."
He then mounted the chair again and 
said to the people, "I have just heard
that the last man who spoke belongs to
the Latter-day Saints," and he began to
rail against us.
Elder Kimball asked him to let him 
step into the chair to give out an ap-
pointment for a 3 o'clock meeting, but
he would not let him. Brother Kimball 
then raised his voice and informed the
people that some American preachers 
would preach there at 3 o'clock.
At the appointed time we were at the 
place. The conduct of the preacher and
the excitement upon the subject brought 
a large congregation to hear us. I 
opened the meeting by singing and
prayer and spoke about twenty minutes, 
from Gal. I. 8-9 v., and was followed by 
Elder Kimball for about the same length 
of time. The people gave good attention
and seemed to be much interested in 
what they heard.
After meeting, Mr. Corner invited us
home; but soon after we arrived, at his 
house, Elder Kimball felt impressed to 
return to the place of preaching. When 
he got there he found a large company 
talking about the things which they had AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.

We were now in [[England|England's]] great met-
ropolis to sound to it the first procla-
mation of the Latter-day Work: for Heber
C. Kimball, [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]], and my-
self were the three first elders in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]
to preach the Gospel and establish the
Church of Latter-day Saints.
We took a walk into the city, passed 
[[London Bridge, London, Middlesex, England|London Bridge]] twice, and returned and 
spent the night at the [[King's Arms Inn, London, Middlesex, England|King's Arms]].
On the following day we called 
upon the Rev. [[J. E. Smith|J. E. Smith]], Lin-
coln's Inn Fields, also visited John
Pye, 16 Curiosity Street, Chancery
Lane. He was a strong believer in the
prophecies of [[Joanna Southcoat|Joanna Southcott]] and was 
one of the society. We then returned 
and had a view of [[St. Paul's Cathedral, London, Middlesex, England|St. Paul's Cathedral]], 
the largest in the world except St. Peter's 
at Rome. We crossed London Bridge, 
took tea at 19 King Street, and then 
went to Union Chapel, Waterloo Road, 
and heard a comical sermon delivered 
by an Aitkenite preacher. I spent the 
night at 58 King Street at Mrs. Loftus.
The next day, August the 21st, was 
the most interesting sight-seeing day in 
my life, as far as viewing the splendid 
works of man. I started in company 
of Elders Heber C. Kimball and George
A. Smith for a walk over the City of 
London. We crossed London Bridge,
passed through King William Street, 
and several other streets, and visited
[[Covent Garden, London, Middlesex, England|Covent Garden]]; then through St. Mar-
tin Street and Court, [[Leicester Square, London, Middlesex, England|Leicester Square]], 
Sidney Alley, Coventry Street, Pica-
dilly, Glass House Street and through 
most of [[Regent Street, London, Middlesex, England|Regent Street]],âone of the 
most splendid streets in the world. We 
passed through Langham Place, and All 
Souls Church, which has a spire naked 
from its base to the top, then through 
[[Oxford Street, London, Middlesex, England|Oxford Street]], and returned by way of 
St. Paul's, ending our sight-seeing of the 
day by visiting the noted [[The Monument, London, Middlesex, England|monument]] 
erected in commemoration of the great
fire in London in 1666, and built under
the direction of that famous architect, 
Sir Christopher Wren. We entered a 
door at its base, paid six pence on enter-
ing, and ascended three hundred and 
forty-five black marble steps, which
brought us up two hundred feet into the
air and about one hundred feet higher 
than the highest houses. We stepped on
the outside of the pillar, which is sur-
rounded by an iron railing, and here we
[Column 2]
had presented to our view an indescrib-
able scenery on every hand of the great-
est city in the world, which can boast of 
a history of nearly two thousand years. 
At our feet, as it were, lay a historical 
panorama, stretching out to our view 
around.
We were situated so as to overlook 
nearly every part of the city. East of 
us lay the ancient [[Tower of London, London, Middlesex, England|Tower of London]]; 
east of us also lay the Mint; north the 
[[Mansion House, London, Middlesex, England|Mansion House]] of the Lord Mayor of 
London; north-west, St. Paul's Church; 
west, [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]] and the House
of Parliament; south lies the River 
Thames with five of the large bridges
across in full view and one not seen from
the Monument, making six. These six 
bridges are fine sights in themselves. 
They are the architectural monuments
of the Thames, and our view of them 
from our high pinnacle with their crowds
of moving and ever changing human 
masses, and cabs, omnibuses, carriages,
drays, etc., which dash along, presented 
to us a picturesque sight. In addition
to all this, within our view, was London
Borough, on the south of the river, and 
all around us hundreds of churches, 
chapels, and spires, standing in the 
midst of one universal mass of buildings,
covering about six square miles of 
ground. While viewing this prospect on
a clear day, we conversed with a Prussian 
traveler, a citizen of Berlin, who had 
traveled much over Europe and [[Asia|Asia]] and
other parts of the world, and he declared 
that we could not find another spot on 
the face of the earth that would present
to our view so grand a scenery as the 
one before us.
August 23rd we went to Zion's chapel 
and heard the celebrated Rev. Robert 
Aitken preach two sermons. He de-
livered a powerful warning to the 
Gentiles, and presented some of the
most sublime truths I ever heard from a 
sectarian priest; but he was building 
without the foundation.
On the 24th we removed our lodgings
to Mr. [[Robert Merryfield|Robert Merryfields]], No. 15 
Gloucester Row, Grange Road, where 
we obtained a room for all three of us.
On the 25th of August we attended a 
meeting of the Temperance Society, at 
their [[Temperance Hall, London, Middlesex, England|hall]], which we engaged, but could 
not have it until the 7th of the next 
month. Brother Smith made a short TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
But the archbishop and council, know-
ing well that the laws of [[England|England]] gave
free toleration to all religions under the 
British flag, sent word to the petitioners
that if they had the worth of souls at 
heart as much as they had the ground 
where hares, foxes and hounds ran, they 
would not lose so many of their flock.
I continued to preach and baptize 
daily.
On the 21st day of March I baptized 
Elder [[Thomas Kington|Thomas Kingston]]. He was super-
intendent of both preachers and members 
of the United Brethren.
The first thirty days after my arrival 
in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], I had baptized forty-
five preachers and one hundred and 
sixty members of the United Brethren, 
who put into my hands one chapel and 
forty-five houses, which were licensed 
according to law to preach in.
This opened a wide field for labor, 
and enabled me to bring into the 
Church, through the blessings of God, 
over eighteen hundred souls during eight
months, including all of the six hundred 
United Brethren except one person; also 
including some two hundred preachers
of various denominations.
This field of labor embraced Hereford-
shire, [[Gloucestershire, England|Gloucestershire]] and Worcester-
shire, and formed the conference of Gar-
way, [[Gadfield Elm, Worcestershire, England|Gadfield Elm]] and [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]].
I was visited by President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and 
Dr. [[Willard Richards|Richards]].
Brother [[John Benbow|Benbow]] furnished us with 
Â£300 to print the first Book of Mor-
mon that was published in England: and 
on the 20th of May, 1840, Brigham 
Young, Willard Richards and I held a
council on the top of [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]], and 
there decided that Brigham Young go
direct to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and publish 3,000
copies of the Hymn Book and 3,000 
copies of the Book of Mormon, this
being the first publication of these books
in England.
The power of God rested upon us and 
upon the mission.
The sick were healed, devils were cast 
out, and the lame were made to walk.
One case I will mention: [[Mary Pitt|Mary Pitt]], 
who died in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], sister to [[William Hill Pitt|Wm. Pitt]], 
who died in [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]], had not 
walked upon her feet for eleven years. 
We carried her into the water and I bap-
tized her.
On the evening of the 18th of May,
[Column 2]
1840, at Brother Kingston's house in 
[[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]], Elders Brigham Young, Wil-
lard Richards and I laid hands upon her
head and confirmed her.
Brigham Young, being mouth, re-
buked her lameness, and commanded
her to arise and walk, in the name of
the Lord. The lameness then left her, 
and she never afterwards used a staff or 
crutch.
She walked through the town of Dy-
mock next day, which created a stir
among the people; but the wicked did
not feel to give God the glory.
The whole history of this Hereford-
shire mission shows the importance of 
listening to the still small voice ot the 
Spirit of God and the revelations of the
Holy Ghost.
The Lord had a people there prepared 
for the gospel. They were preparing for
light and truth, and the Lord sent me to
them, and I declared the gospel of life 
and salvation unto them, and some 
eighteen hundred souls received it, and 
many of them have been gathered to 
Zion in these mountains. Many of them
have also been called to officiate in the
bishopric, and have done much good in 
Zion. But in all these things we should 
ever acknowledge the hand of God, and 
give Him the honor, praise and glory, 
forever and ever. Amen.
On the 17th of August 1840, I took
the parting hand of the Saints in Here-
fordshire and started on a mission to 
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]], in company with Apostles 
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and George A.
Smith. We rode from Leigh to Chel-
tenham, where we tarried for the night
and in the morning took coach and rode
forty miles through a most delightful 
country, which everywhere wore the 
golden hue of a plentiful harvest, passed
through [[Oxfordshire, England|Oxfordshire]], in sight of [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire, England|Stowe]], 
the family residence of the Duke of 
[[Buckingham, Buckinghamshire, England|Buckingham]], and at Farmington Station, 
took train for London where we arrived
at 4 p. m. We changed conveyance
to the center of the city by omnibus, 
walked across [[London Bridge, London, Middlesex, England|London Bridge]] into the 
Borough, and called upon Mrs. [[Mary Ann Kimberley Allgood|Allgood]]
the sister of Elder [[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley's]] 
[[Frances Amelia Kimberley Turley|wife]]. She treated us with kindness, 
gave us refreshments and then directed 
us to a public house, the [[King's Arms Inn, London, Middlesex, England|King's Arms]], 
King Street, Borough. Here we tarried 
for the night.AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
were licensed according to the law of the
land for preaching in.
This body of United Brethren were
searching for light and truth, but had 
gone as far as they could, and were con-
tinually calling upon the Lord to open 
the way before them, and send them 
light and knowledge that they might
know the true way to be saved.
When I heard these things I could 
clearly see why the Lord had command-
ed me, while in the town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], to 
leave that place of labor and go to the 
south, for in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] there was a 
great harvest-field for gathering many 
Saints into the kingdom of God.
I retired to my bed with joy after 
offering my prayers and thanksgiving to 
God, and slept sweetly until the rising 
of the sun.
I arose on the morning of the 5th, 
took breakfast, and told Mr. [[John Benbow|Benbow]] I 
would like to commence my Master's 
business, by preaching the gospel to the 
people.
He had a large hall in his mansion 
which was licensed for preaching, and he
sent word through the neighborhood 
that an American missionary would 
preach at his house that evening.
As the time drew nigh many of the 
neighbors came in, and I preached my
first gospel sermon in the house. I also 
preached on the following evening at the
same place, and baptized six persons, 
including Mr. John Benbow and his [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]],
and four preachers of the United Brethren.
I spent most of the following day in 
clearing out a pool of water, and 
preparing it for baptizing in, as I saw
many to be baptized there. I afterwards
baptized six hundred in that pool of 
water.
On Sunday, the 8th, I preached at 
[[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]] in the morning, at Stand-
ley Hill in the afternoon, and at John 
Benbow's, [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill Farm]], in the evening.
The parish church that stood in the 
neighborhood of Brother Benbow's, pre-
sided over by the rector of the parish, 
was attended during the day by only fif-
teen persons, while I had a large congre-
gation, estimated to number a thousand, 
attend my meeting through the day and
evening.
When I arose in the evening to speak 
at Brother Benbow's house, a man en-
tered the door and informed me that he
[Column 2]
was a constable, and had been sent by
the rector of the parish with a warrant 
to arrest me.
I asked him "For what crime?"
He said, "For preaching to the peo-
ple."
I told him that I, as well as the rec-
tor, had a license for preaching the gos-
pel to the people, and that if he would 
take a chair I would wait upon him after
meeting.
He took my chair and sat beside me. 
I preached the first principles of the
everlasting gospel for an hour and a 
quarter. The power of God rested upon 
me, the Spirit filled the house, and the 
people were convinced.
At the close of the meeting I opened
a door for baptism, and seven offered
themselves. Among the number were 
four preachers and the constable.
The latter arose and said, "Mr. Wood-
ruff, I would like to be baptized."
I told him I would like to baptize 
him. I went down to the pool and bap-
tized the seven. We then met together 
and I confirmed thirteen, and broke 
bread unto the Saints and we all rejoiced 
together.
The constable went to the rector and 
told him if he wanted Mr. Woodruff 
taken up for preaching the gospel, he
must go himself and serve the writ, for 
he had heard him preach the only true
gospel sermon he had ever listened to in 
his life.
The rector did not know what to make 
of it, so he sent two clerks of the Church 
of England as spies, to attend our meet-
ing, and find out what we did preach.
But they were both pricked in their 
hearts and received the word of the 
Lord gladly, and were baptized and con-
firmed members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The rector became alarmed and did 
not dare to send anybody else.
The ministers and rectors of the South 
of England called a convention and 
sent a petition to the Archbishop of 
[[Canterbury, Kent, England|Canterbury]], to request parliament to
pass a law prohibiting the Mormons 
from preaching in the British dominion.
In this petition the rector stated that 
one "Mormon" missionary had baptized 
fifteen hundred persons, mostly members
of the English church, during the last 
seven months.TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
I was called upon to visit the child. 
I found it in great distress, writhing
in its mother's arms. We laid hands upon
it and cast the devil out of it, and the 
evil spirits had no power over the house-
hold afterwards.
This was done by the power of God, 
and not of man. We laid hands upon
twenty in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] who were sick, 
and they were mostly healed.
On the 21st, I arrived in [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] by 
coach, and met, for the first time, with
Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]]. This being my 
field of labor, I stopped and commenced 
work.
Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] stopped in the pottery 
district some eight days, then went to 
[[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]], his field of labor.
I received a letter on the 10th of Feb-
ruary, from Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], who was 
at [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]], saying they had commenced 
there and baptized ten persons.
I labored in the Staffordshire Potteries, 
in Burslem, [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]], [[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]], 
and several other villages, from the 22nd, 
of January until the 2nd of March, 
preaching every night in the week and 
two or three times on the Sabbath.
I baptized, confirmed and blessed 
many, and we had a good field open for 
labor. Many were believing, and it ap-
peared as though we had a door open to
bring many into the Church in that part 
of the vineyard.
March 1st, 1840, was my birthday, 
when I was thirty-three years of age. It 
being Sunday, I preached twice through 
the day to a large assembly in the City 
Hall, in the town of Hanley, and ad-
ministered the sacrament unto the
Saints.
In the evening I again met with a large
assembly of the Saints and strangers, and 
while singing the first hymn the Spirit of 
the Lord rested upon me, and the voice 
of God said to me, "This is the last 
meeting that you will hold with this peo-
ple for many days."
I was astonished at this, as I had 
many appointments out in that district.
When I arose to speak to the people, 
I told them that it was the last meeting 
I should hold with them for many days. 
They were as much astonished as I was.
At the close of the meeting four 
persons came forward for baptism, and 
we went down into the water and bap-
tized them.
[Column 2]
In the morning I went in secret before
the Lord, and asked Him what His will 
was concerning me.
The answer I got was, that I should 
go to the south, for the Lord had a great 
work for me to perform there, as many 
souls were waiting for the word of the
Lord.
On the 3rd of March, 1840, in fulfill-
ment of the word of the Lord to me, I 
took coach and rode to [[Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England|Wolverhampton]],
twenty-six miles, and spent the night
there.
On the morning of the 4th I again 
took coach, and rode through [[Dudley, Staffordshire, England|Dudley]], 
[[Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England|Stourbridge]], [[Stourport, Worcestershire, England|Stourport]] and [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]], 
and then walked a number of miles to 
Mr. [[John Benbow|John Benbow's]], [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill Farm]], Castle 
Frome, Ledbury, Herefordshire. This 
was a farming country in the south of 
England, a region where no Elder of the
Latter-day Saints had visited.
I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthy 
farmer, cultivating three hundred acres
of land, occupying a good mansion, and
having plenty of means. His wife, [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Jane]], 
had no children.
I presented myself to him as a mission-
ary from America, an Elder of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, who had been sent to him by the 
commandment of God as a messenger of 
salvation, to preach the gospel of life 
unto him and his household, and the in-
habitants of the land.
Mr. Benbow and his wife received me 
with glad hearts and thanksgiving. It 
was in the evening when I arrived, hav-
ing traveled forty-eight miles by coach 
and on foot during the day, but after
receiving refreshments we sat down to-
gether, and conversed until two o'clock
in the morning.
Mr. Benbow and his wife rejoiced 
greatly at the glad tidings which I 
brought unto them of the fulness of the
everlasting gospel, which God had re-
vealed through the mouth of His Prophet,
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], in these last days.
I rejoiced greatly at the news that Mr.
Benbow gave me, that there was a 
company of men and womenâover six 
hundred in numberâwho had broken off 
from the Wesleyan Methodists, and taken
the name of United Brethren. They 
had forty-five preachers among them, 
and had chapels and many houses that AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
ness, and that it was with difficulty that
they could travel.
After spending six days in [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]], 
Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], in company with 
Elder [[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley]] and myself sailed 
out of [[New York Harbor, New York County, New York|New York Harbor]] for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]], 
on board the packet ship Oxford, on the
19th of December, 1839.
We took steerage passage, which cost 
fifteen dollars each. We had storms and 
rough weather, but most of the winds 
were favorable for a quick passage.
While on the ship, a Methodist min-
ister got into a discussion with some Cath-
olics who were in the company, and the 
arguments of the minister ran rather 
more into abuse than sound argument.
Elder Taylor told the Methodist min-
ister that he did not think it was becom-
ing in a daughter to find so much fault 
with the mother as they did, for as the 
Methodists came out of the Catholics, 
Elder Taylor thought the mother had as
much right to enjoy her religion un-
molested as the daughter had. That 
ended the argument.
Our company consisted of 109 souls,
composed of Americans, English, Scotch,
Irish, Welsh and Dutch.
We arrived in Liverpool dock on the 
11th day of January, 1840, having made
the voyage from New York in twenty-
three days.
On January 13th, 1840, after visiting 
Mr. [[George Cannon|George Cannon]], the father of Presi-
dent [[George Quayle Cannon|George Q. Cannon]], and his family, 
we took cars in the evening, and arrived 
in the midst of the [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] branch of 
the Saints, built up in 1837, by Elders 
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and 
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]].
We very soon had a pleasant interview
with Elder Willard Richards, who had 
remained in Preston to take care of the 
Church, while the rest had returned 
home to America.
We spent three days at Preston in 
visiting the Saints, and on the 17th we
held a council at Elder Richards' home
in that place.
After consulting upon the best course
for us to pursue, it was finally resolved 
that Elder John Taylor and Joseph 
Fielding go to Liverpool, Elder Wood-
ruff to [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]], Theodore 
Turley to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]], Elder Richards 
wherever the Spirit might direct him,
[Column 2]
and that [[William Clayton|William Clayton]] preside over
the branch in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]].
After various principles of the Church
had been expounded by the Apostles 
present, the council adjourned.
Elder Willard Richards had been 
called to be one of the quorum of the
Twelve Apostles, but had not yet re-
ceived his ordination.
On the day following I parted with
Elders Taylor and Fielding, who went
to Liverpool, and with Elder Richards,
who tarried in Preston. Elder Turley 
and I went to Manchester.
It was the first time I ever visited that 
city. I here first met with Elder Wm. 
Clayton. As soon as I had an introduc-
tion to him, he informed me that one of 
the sisters in that place was possessed of 
the devil, and he asked me to go and 
cast it out of her, thinking that one of 
the Twelve Apostles could do anything
in this line he might wish to.
However, I went with him to the 
house where the woman lay, in the hands 
of three men, in a terrible rage, and 
trying to tear her clothing from her.
I also found quite a number of Saints 
present, and some unbelievers, who had 
come to see the devil cast out and a
miracle wrought.
If I had acted upon my own judg-
ment I should not have attempted to ad-
minister to her with the company pres-
ent, but as I was a stranger there, and 
Brother Clayton presided over the 
branch, I joined him in administering to 
the woman. But the unbelief of the 
wicked present was so great, we could 
not cast the devil out of her, and she 
raged worse than ever.
I then ordered the room to be cleared, 
and when the company left the house, 
except the few attending to her, we laid 
hands upon her, and I commanded the 
devil to come out of her, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and 
she was entirely cured and fell asleep.
The next day being the Sabbath, she 
came before a large congregation of peo-
ple, and bore testimony to what the 
Lord had done for her. We had a large
assemblage through the day and evening, 
to whom I preached the gospel.
On Monday morning, the devil, not 
being satisfied with being cast out of the
woman, entered into her little child, 
which was but a few months old.TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE

myself. Under these circumstances, 
Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] advised me to continue 
my journey with Brother [[John Coltrin|Coltrin]], and 
make the best of my way to [[New York|New York]].
After committing Elder Taylor into
the hands of the Lord, though painful 
to me, I gave him the parting hand and
started. I left him in [[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]], 
Wayne County, Indiana, in the hand sof
a merciful God and a kind and benevo-
lent family, who promised to do every-
thing in their power to make him com-
fortable until his recovery.
This they did, though he passed 
through a severe course of the billious
fever, and was sick nigh unto death.
Through the mercy of God, however, 
he recovered from his sickness, and con-
tinued his journey. We next met in the 
City of [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]].
I continued my journey with Father 
Coltrin, and we reached [[Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cleveland]] on
the 18th of September. We there took
steamer for [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]], but were three days 
and a night in a storm before we made 
the harbor. We landed at midnight, 
and in doing so we ran into a schooner, 
and stove it in.
From Buffalo I traveled to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]] in 
a canal boat, and had a stroke of the 
ague daily.
While on my journey, at Albany, I 
took a stage in the night, and rode to
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] home in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], on the
21st of September.
I was glad to meet with my father's 
family and the other members of the
small branch of the Church which ex-
isted there upon this occasion, as I found 
them all strong in the faith of the gos-
pel, and glad to meet with me.
I was still suffering with the ague
daily.
On the 27th of September, my grand-
mother (on my [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|mother's]] side), Anna
Thompson, died at [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]]. She was 
eighty-four years of age.
It was a singular coincidence that she
with her husband, [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot Thompson]], also 
[[Mercy Thompson|Mercy Thompson]] and Samuel Thomp-
son, all of one family, died when they
were eighty-four years of age. I was
not able to attend my grandmother's 
funeral.
On the 4th of October, 1839, my 
uncle, [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart]], died, aged forty-three 
years. I had visited him in his sickness,
and preached the gospel to him, and he
[Column 2]
was believing. I had also been associated 
with him from my youth up.
On his death-bed he sent me a request 
that I would preach his funeral sermon.
I was having the chills and fever
daily at the time, attended with a very 
severe cough, so much so, that my father
thought that I would never leave his 
home alive. But when they brought me
the request of my dying uncle, and the 
day came for his burial, I told my father
to get his horse and buggy ready, for I 
was going to attend the funeral.
He thought I was very reckless in re-
gard to my own life, as I had suffered 
with the chills and fever some fifteen 
days, and to attempt to speak in my 
weak state, and to begin at the same
hour that my chill was to come on, 
seemed to him foolhardy.
My parents were quite alarmed, yet
according to my request my father got 
up his team, and I rode with him and 
my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]] five miles, through a 
cold, chilly wind, and I commenced 
speaking to a large congregation, at the
same hour that my chill had been in the 
habit of coming on.
I spoke over an hour with great free-
dom, and my chill left me from that 
hour, and I had no more attacks for
many days.
On the Monday following, October 
17th, I felt sufficiently restored to health 
to continue my journey. I took leave of 
my father and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]], and left for New 
York, where I arrived on the morning 
of the 8th of November.
I spent two months and seven days 
after my arrival in New York, in travel-
ing and preaching in that city, New
Jersey and [[Long Island, Queens County, New York|Long Island]], a portion of the
time with [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]. I 
had frequent attacks during this time of 
the chills and fever, but I preached al-
most daily.
On the 13th of December I attended
our conference in New York City, with 
Parley P. Pratt, and on this day Elder 
John Taylor arrived in our midst, and it 
was a happy meeting.
He had passed through a severe siege
of sickness after we parted, but through
the mercy of God had been preserved,
and was able to continue his journey. 
He also informed us that others of the
Twelve had suffered a great deal of sick-AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.

bare. [[Parley Parker Pratt|He]] was hewing a log, preparing
to build a cabin.
He said: "Brother Woodruff, I have 
no money, but I have an empty purse,
which I will give you..' He brought it 
to me, and I thanked him for it.
We went a few rods further, and met
Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], in the same 
condition, also hewing a log, towards 
building a cabin.
He said: "As Parley has given you a 
purse, I have got a dollar I will give you 
to put in it."
He gave me both a dollar and a bless-
ing.
We drove sixteen miles across a prairie, 
and spent the night with a Brother Mer-
rill. The day following we rode ten 
miles, to a Brother [[Ute Perkins Sr.|Perkins']], and he took
us in his wagon to [[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]], and from
thence to Brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith's]].
I rode four hours during the day over
a very rough road of stones and stumps, 
lying on my back in the bottom of the
wagon, shaking with the ague, and I 
suffered much.
We held a meeting in a grove near 
Don Carlos Smith's, and here Elder 
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] baptized [[George Miller|George Miller]], who 
afterwards was ordained a bishop.
At the meeting the Saints gave us nine
dollars, and George Miller gave us a 
horse to help us on our journey.
I rode to [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] with Father Col-
trin, where I had an interview with 
several families of the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Island]] Saints, 
whom I had brought up with me from 
Fox Islands in 1838. I spent several 
days with them and at [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], where
Elder Taylor published fifteen hundred 
copies, in pamphlet form, of a brief 
sketch of the persecutions and sufferings
of the Latter-dav Saints, inflicted by the
inhabitants of [[Missouri|Missouri]].
We sold our horse, and in company 
with Father Coltrin, Brother Taylor and 
myself left Springfield, and continued
our journey.
I had the chills and fever nearly every
other day, which made riding in a lum-
ber wagon very distressing to me, es-
pecially when I shook with the ague.
On the 24th of August, we rode to 
[[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]], and spent the night with
Dr. [[Charles Burns Modesitt|Modisett]]. I suffered much with the
chills and fever.
Elder John Taylor up to this time had 
appeared to enjoy excellent health, but
[Column 2]
the destroyer did not intend to make
him an exception to the rest of the 
Apostles. On the 28th of August, he 
fell to the ground as though he had been
knocked down. He fainted away, but
soon revived. On the following day, 
however, the enemy made a powerful 
attack upon his life. He fainted away
several times, and it seemed as though
he would die. We stopped several hours 
with him at a house by the wayside. 
We then took him into the wagon and 
drove to [[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|Horace S. Eldredge's]], and 
spent the remainder of the day and night 
doctoring him.
In the morning Brother Taylor was so 
far recovered that he thought he would
be able to ride. So we started on our 
journey on the morning of the 30th, and 
we traveled forty miles, to [[Louisville, Henry County, Indiana|Louisville]], 
and spent the night with the family of 
Brother [[James Townsend|James Townsend]].
We felt terribly shaken up, being in 
such a weak state. Brother Townsend 
was away from home, but we were kindly
entertained by Sister [[Susan Davis Townsend|Townsend]].
In the morning Elder Taylor, though 
very weak, felt disposed to continue his
journey. We traveled fourteen miles to 
[[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]]. He was quite sick at 
night, and the bilious fever seemed to 
settle upon him. I was also very feeble, 
myself.
On the day following, September 1st, 
being Sunday, Brother Taylor concluded
to remain there for the day, and hold a
meeting.
It was a German settlement. He 
wished me to speak, and I spoke upon 
the first principles of the gospel. He 
followed me, and spoke until he was ex-
hausted.
After we returned to the inn where we 
were stopping, I was taken with a chill 
and fever, and had a very bad night. 
Brother Taylor was also very sick.
The following day, September 2nd, was 
a painful day to my feelings. It was 
evident that Brother Taylor had a settled 
fever upon him, and would not be able 
to travel.
Father Coltrin was resolved to con-
tinue his journey, and, in conversing 
with Brother Taylor, he thought it better 
for one sick man to be left than for two, 
as I was so sick with the chills and fever 
that I was not able to render him any 
assistance, nor, indeed, to take care of TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
scraping unto men in whom you have no
confidence. Be honest, open, and frank 
in all your intercourse with mankind.
"I wish to say to the Twelve and all 
the Saints, to profit by this important
key, that in all your trials, troubles,
temptations, afflictions, bonds, imprison-
ments and deaths, see to it that you do
not betray Jesus Christ, that you do not
betray the revelations of God, whether
in the Bible, Book of Mormon, or Doc-
trine and Covenants, or any of the 
words of God.
"Yea, in all your troubles, see that 
you do not this thing, lest innocent 
blood be found upon your skirts, and ye 
go down to hell.
"We may ever know by this sign that 
there is danger of our being led to a fall 
and apostasy when we give way to the
devil, so as to neglect the first known 
duty; but whatever you do, do not be-
tray your friend."
The foregoing are some of the instruc-
tions given to the Twelve by the Prophet
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], before they started upon their
missions.
Inasmuch as the devil had been in a
measure thwarted by the Twelve going
to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and returning without
harm, it seemed as though the destroyer 
was determined to make some other at-
tempt upon us to hinder us from per-
forming our missions; for it seemed that 
as soon as any one of the Apostles began 
to prepare for starting, he was smitten 
with chills and fever or sickness of some
kind.
Nearly all of the quorum of the
Twelve or their families began to be
sick, so it still required the exercise of a
good deal of faith and perseverance to
start off on a mission.
On the 25th of July, for the first time
in my life, I was attacked with chills and 
fever; and this I had every other day,
and, whenever attacked, I was laid pros-
trate.
My wife, [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phoebe]], was also soon taken 
down with the chills and fever, as were 
quite a number of the Twelve.
I passed thirteen days in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] 
with my family, after I was taken sick, 
before I started on my mission.
The 7th of August was the last day I 
spent at home in Montrose, and although
sick with the chills and fever the most of
the day, I made what preparations I
[Column 2]
could to start on the morrow on a mis-
sion of four thousand miles, to preach 
the gospel to the nations of the earth,
and this, too, without purse or scrip, 
with disease resting upon me, and a
stroke of fever and ague once every two 
days.
Early upon the morning of the 8th of 
August, I arose from my bed of sickness, 
laid my hands upon the head of my 
sick wife, Phoebe, and blessed her. I 
then departed from the embrace of my
companion, and left her almost without
food or the necessaries of life.
She parted from me with the fortitude
that becomes a Saint, realizing the re-
sponsibilities of her companion. I quote
from my journal:
"Phoebe, farewell! Be of good cheer; 
remember me in your prayers. I leave 
these pages for your perusal when I am 
gone. I shall see thy face again in the
flesh. I go to obey the commands of
Jesus Christ."
Although feeble, I walked to the
banks of the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]]. There 
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] took me in a canoe
(having no other conveyance) and pad-
dled me across the river.
When we landed, I lay down on a
side of sole leather, by the post office, 
to rest.
Brother Joseph, the Prophet of God, 
came along and looked at me.
"Well, Brother Woodruff," said he,
"you have started upon your mission."
"Yes," said I, "but I feel and look 
more like a subject for the dissecting
room than a missionary."
Joseph replied: "What did you say
that for? Get up, and go along; all 
will be right with you!"
I name these incidents that the reader 
may know how the brethren of the
Twelve Apostles started upon their mis-
sions to [[England|England]], in 1839.
Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] was going with me,
and we were the first two of the quorum
of the Twelve who started on their
mission.
Brother Taylor was about the only 
man in the quorum that was not sick.
Soon a brother came along with a
wagon, and took us in. As we were 
driving through the place, we came to

healing since the organization of the 
Church.
When we left Brother [[Joseph Bates Noble|Noble]], the
Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Jeseph]] went, with those who 
accompanied him from the other side to
the banks of the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]], to return home.
While waiting for the ferry-boat, a
man of the world, knowing of the mir-
acles which had been performed, came
to him and asked him if he would not 
go and heal two twin children of his
about five months old, who were both
lying sick nigh unto death.
They were some two miles from Mon-
trose.
The Prophet said he could not go;
but, after pausing some time, he said 
he would send some one to heal them;
and he turned to me and said: "You go 
with the man and heal his children."
He took a red silk handkerchief out 
of his pocket and gave it to me, and 
told me to wipe their faces with the 
handkerchief when I administered to 
them, and they should be healed. He
also said unto me: "As long as you will
keep that handkerchief, it shall remain
a league between you and me.''
I went with the man, and did as the
Prophet commanded me, and the chil-
dren were healed.
I have possession of the handkerchief 
unto this day.
On the first of July, 1839, Joseph
Smith and his counselors, Sydney Rig-
don and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], crossed the river 
to Montrose, to spend the day with the 
Twelve, and set them apart and bless 
them, before they started upon their
missions. There were twelve of us who 
met there, and we all dined in my 
house.
After dinner, we assembled at Brother 
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]] house for our meeting.
Brother Hyrum Smith opened by 
prayer; after which the Presidency laid
their hands upon our heads and gave
each of us a blessing.
President Rigdon was mouth in bless-
ing me, and also blessed Sisters [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]], 
[[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]].
The prophet Joseph promised us if we 
would be faithful, we should be blessed
upon our mission, have many souls as 
seals of our ministry, and return again
in peace and safety to our families and
friends; all of which was fulfilled.
Brother Hyrum advised me to preach
[Column 2]
the first principles of the gospel; he
thought that was about as much as this
generation could endure.
Then Joseph arose and preached some 
precious things of the kingdom of God 
unto us, in the power of the Holy Ghost; 
some of which I here copy from my 
journal:
"Ever keep in exercise the principle 
of mercy, and be ready to forgive our 
brethren on the first intimation of their
repentance and desire for forgiveness;
for our Heavenly Father will be equally
as merciful unto us. We also ought to 
be willing to repent of and confess our 
sins, and keep nothing back. Let the 
Twelve be humble and not be exalted,
and beware of pride and not seek to ex-
cel one another, but act for each other's
good, and honorably make mention of 
each other's names in prayer before the 
Lord and before your fellow-men. Do 
not backbite or devour a brother. The 
elders of Israel should seek to learn by
precept and example in this late age of
the world and not be obliged to learn 
everything we know by sad experience. 
I trust the remainder of the Twelve will
learn wisdom and not follow the example
of those who have fallen. When the 
Twelve, or any other witnesses of Jesus
Christ, stand before the congregations
of the earth, and they preach in the 
power and demonstration of the Holy 
Ghost, and the people are astonished
and confounded at the doctrine, and say
'That man has preached a powerful ser-
mon,' then let that man or those men
take care that they do not ascribe the 
glory unto themselves, but be careful
that they are humble, and ascribe the
glory to God and the Lamb; for it is by 
the power of the Holy Priesthood and
the Holy Ghost that they have the power
thus to speak.
"Who art thou, O man, but dust! and 
from whom dost thou receive thy power
and blessings, but from God?
"Then let the Twelve Apostles and 
Elders of Israel observe this key, and be
wise: Ye are not sent out to be taught, 
but to teach.
"Let every man be sober, be vigilant, 
and let all his words be seasoned with
grace, and keep in mind it is a day of 
warning, and not of many words.
"Act honestly before God and man; 
beware of sophistry, such as bowing and TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
spoken by any of the company from the 
time they left Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham's]] house
till we crossed the public square, and 
entered Brother [[Elijah Fordham|Fordham's]] house. Bro-
ther Fordham had been dying for an
hour, and we expected each minute
would be his last.
I felt the power of God that was
overwhelming His [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]].
When we entered the house, Brother 
Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham,
and took him by the right hand; in his
left hand he held his hat.
He saw that Brother Fordham's eyes
were glazed, and that he was speechless 
and unconscious.
After taking hold of his hand, he 
looked down into the dying man's face
and said: "Brother Fordham do you
not know me?" At first he made no 
reply; but we could all see the effect of 
the spirit of God resting upon him.
He again said: "Elijah, do you not
know me?"
With a low whisper, Brother Ford-
ham answered, "Yes!"
The Prophet then said, "Have you 
not faith to be healed?"
The answer, which was a little plainer
than before, was: "I am afraid it is too
late. If you had come sooner, I think
it might have been."
He had the appearance of a man wak-
ing from sleep. It was the sleep of 
death.
Joseph then said: "Do you believe
that Jesus is the Christ?"
"I do, Brother Joseph," was the re-
ponse.
Then the Prophet of God spoke with
a loud voice, as in the majesty of the 
Godhead: "Elijah, I command you, in
the name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise
and be made whole!''
The words of the Prophet were not 
like the words of man, but like the voice
of God. It seemed to me that the
house shook from its foundation.
Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed 
like a man raised from the dead. A 
healthy color came to his face, and life 
was manifested in every act.
His feet were done up in Indian meal 
poultices. He kicked them off his feet, 
scattered the contents, and then called 
for his clothes and put them on. He
asked for a bowl of bread and milk, and
ate it; then put on his hat and followed
[Column 2]
us into the street, to visit others who
were sick.
The unbeliever may ask: "Was there 
not deception in this?"
If there is any deception in the mind 
of the unbeliever, there was certainly 
none with Elijah Fordham, the dying 
man, nor with those who were present
with him, for in a few minutes he would
have been in the spirit world, had he 
not been rescued. Through the bless-
ing of God, he lived up till 1880, in 
which year he died in [[Utah Territory|Utah]], while all 
who were with him on that occasion,
with the exception of one, are in the
spirit world.
Among the number were Joseph and 
[[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], Brigham
Young, [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], George A. 
Smith, [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]. 
Wilford Woodruff is the only one living 
who was present at that time, and he 
will soon mingle with those who have
gone.
As soon as we left Brother Fordham's
house, we went into the house of Joseph
B. Noble, who was very low and danger-
ously sick.
When we entered the house, Brother
Joseph took him by the hand, and com-
manded him, in the name of Jesus
Christ, to arise and be made whole. 
He did arise and was immediately
healed.
While this was going on, the wicked
mob in the place, led by one [[David Wells Kilbourne|Kilburn]],
had become alarmed, and followed us 
into Brother Noble's house.
Before they arrived there, Brother 
Joseph had called upon Brother Ford-
ham to offer prayer.
While he was praying, the mob en-
tered, with all the evil spirits accom-
panying them.
As soon as they entered, Brother 
Fordham, who was praying, fainted and 
sank to the floor.
When Joseph saw the mob in the
house, he arose and had the room cleared
of both that class of men and their at-
tendant devils. Then Brother Fordham
immediately revived and finished his 
prayer.
This case of Brother Noble's was the
last one of healing upon that day. It 
was greatest day for the manifestation of
the power of God through the gift of AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.

sations created by such a meeting, ex-
cept those who have been in tribulation 
for the gospel's sake.
After spending the day together, we
returned to our families at night.
On the day following, May 4th, we
met in conference at [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], the Prophet
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] presiding, which caused great joy
and rejoicing to all the Saints.
On Sunday, May 5th, Joseph Smith
addressed the assembly, followed by
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] and the Twelve Apostles.
The Spirit of the Lord was poured out
upon us, and we had a glorious day.
On May 6th, I met with the Seventies,
and we ordained sixty men into the 
quorums of elders and seventies. Brother 
Joseph met with the Twelve, bishops and
elders, at Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge's]] house; and
there were a number with us who were 
wounded at [[Haun's Mill, Braymer, Caldwell County, Missouri|Haun's Mill]]. Among them 
was [[Isaac Laney|Isaac Laney]], who had been in com-
pany with about twenty others, at the
mill, when a large armed mob fired 
among them with rifles and other 
weapons, and shot down seventeen of the 
brethren, and wounded more. Brother 
Laney fled from the scene, but they
poured a shower of lead after him, which
pierced his body through and through. 
He showed me eleven bullet holes in his
body. There were twenty-seven in his
shirt, seven in his pantaloons, and his
coat was literally cut to pieces. One
ball entered one arm-pit and came out
at the other.
Another entered his back and came 
out at the breast. A ball passed through
each hip, each leg and each arm. All 
these shots were received while he was 
running for life, and, strange as it may 
appear, though he had also one of his
ribs broken, he was able to outrun his
enemies, and his life was saved. We 
can only acknowledge this deliverance 
to be by the power and mercy of God.
President [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] was also
among the number. He also fled, and
although the balls flew around him like
hail, he was not wounded. How myste-
rious are the ways of the Lord!
Before starting on our missions to
[[England|England]], we were under the necessity
of settling our families. A place called
[[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]], afterwards named [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], 
was selected as the place at which our
people should settle.
I left Quincy, in company with
[Column 2]
Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and our families
on the 15th of May, and arrived in 
Commerce on the 18th. After an inter-
view with Joseph we crossed the river at 
[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]], Iowa. President Brigham 
Young and myself, with our families, 
occupied one room about fourteen feet 
square. Finally Brother Young obtained
another room and moved into it by him-
self. Then Brother [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and 
family moved into the same room with 
myself and family.
While I was living in this cabin in the
old barracks, we experienced a day of 
God's power with the Prophet Joseph.
It was a very sickly time and Joseph had
given up his home in Commerce to the
sick, and had a tent pitched in his door-
yard and was living in that himself. 
The large number of Saints who had
been driven out of Missori, were flock-
ing into Commerce; but had no homes 
to go into, and were living in wagons,
in tents, and on the ground. Many, 
therefore, were sick through the ex-
posure they were subjected to. Bro-
ther Joseph had waited on the sick,
until he was worn out and nearly sick
himself.
On the morning of the 22nd of July,
1839, he arose reflecting upon the sit-
uation of the Saints of God in their
persecutions and afflictions, and he 
called upon the Lord in prayer, and the
power of God rested upon him mightily,
and as Jesus healed all the sick around
Him in His day, so Joseph, the Prophet
of God, healed all around on this occa-
sion. He healed all in his house and
door-yard, then, in company with Sidney
Rigdon and several of the Twelve, he 
went through among the sick lying on
the bank of the river, and he com-
manded them in a loud voice, in the
name of Jesus Christ, to come up and 
be made whole, and they were all healed.
When he healed all that were sick on 
the east side of the river, they crossed
the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] in a ferry-boat to
the west side, to Montrose, where we 
were. The first house they went into 
was President Brigham Young's. He
was sick on his bed at the time. The
Prophet went into his house and healed
him, and they all came out together.
As they were passing by my door, Brother
Joseph said: "Brother Woodruff, fol-
low me." These were the only words TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
requirement of the revelation, on the 
18th of April, 1839, I took into my 
wagon [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]: 
and Father [[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]] took into his wagon 
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]], and
we started for [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]].
On the way we met [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]], who 
was going with his family to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]],
Illinois. His wagon had turned over, 
and when we met him he was trying to
gather up a barrel of soft soap with his 
hands. We helped him get up his wagon.
He drove down into the valley below, 
left his wagon, and accompanied us on 
our way.
On the night of the 25th of April, 
we arrived at Far West, and spent the 
night at the home of [[Morris Phelps|Morris Phelps]], who
was not there, however, himself; he,
having been taken prisoner by the mob, 
was still in prison.
On the morning of the 26th of April,
1839, notwithstanding the threats of our 
enemies that the revelation which was to
be fulfilled this day should not be, and 
notwithstanding that ten thousand of the
Saints had been driven out of the State 
by the edict of the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|governor]], and though 
the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his brother, Hy-
rum Smith, with other leading men were 
in the hands of our enemies, in chains
and in prison, we moved on to the tem-
ple grounds in the city of Far West, and 
held a council, and fulfilled the revela-
tion and commandment given unto us, 
and we performed many other things at 
this council.
We excommunicated from the Church 
thirty-one persons, who had apostatized
and become its enemies.
The "Mission of the Twelve" was 
sung, and we then repaired to the south-
east corner of the temple ground, and,
with the assistance of Elder Alpheus 
Cutler, the master workman of the 
building committee, laid the southeast
chief corner stone of the temple, accord-
ing to revelation.
There were present of the Twelve 
Apostles: Brigham Young, Heber C. 
Kimball, Orson Pratt, John E. Page, 
and John Taylor, who proceeded to
ordain Wilford Woodruff and George
A. Smith to the Apostleship.
The Twelve then took their leave of, 
and gave the parting hand to the follow-
ing Saints, agreeable to revelation: A.
Butler, [[Elias Smith|Elias Smith]], [[Norman Shearer|Norman Shearer]],

Peck, [[Artimesia Granger|Artimesia Granger]], [[Martha Peck|Martha Peck]], 
[[Sarah Melissa Granger Kimball|Sarah Granger]], [[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley]], Hi-
ram Clark, and [[Daniel Shearer|Daniel Shearer]].
Bidding good-by to the small remnant 
of the Saints who remained on the temple
ground to see us fulfill the revelation and 
commandments of God, we turned our
backs on Far West and Missouri, and
returned to Illinois. We had accom-
plished the mission without a dog moving
his tongue at us, or any man saying,
"Why do you do so?"
We crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] on the
steam ferry, entered Quincy on the 2nd 
of May, and all had the joy of reaching 
our families once more in peace and
safety.
There was an incident connected with
our journey that is worthy of record.
While we were on our way to fulfill 
the revelation, Joseph, the Prophet, and
his companions in chains had been liber-
ated, through the blessings of God, from
their enemies and prison, and they passed
us. We were not far distant from each 
other, but neither party knew it. They 
were making their way to their families
in Illinois, while we were traveling to 
Far West into the midst of our enemies.
So they came home to their families and 
friends before our return.
May the 3rd was a very interesting day 
to me, as well as to others. In company
with five others of the quorum of the 
Twelve, I rode four miles out of town to
Mr. [[John Cleveland|Cleveland's]], to visit Brother Joseph 
Smith and his family.
Once more I had the happy privilege 
of taking Brother Joseph by the hand. 
Two years had rolled away since I had 
seen his face. He greeted us with great 
joy, as did Hyrum Smith and Lyman 
Wight, all of whom had escaped from
their imprisonment together. They had 
been confined in prison six months, and 
had been under sentence of death three 
times; yet their lives were in the hands 
of God, and He had delivered them,
and they were now mingling with their
wives, children and friends, and out of
the reach of the mob. Joseph was 
frank, open and familiar as usual, and 
our rejoicing was great.
No man can understand the joyful sen-AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.

CHAPTER II.
ORDAINED TO THE APOSTLESHIPâMY MIS-
SION TO [[England|ENGLAND]].
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], the Prophet, asked the
Lord what His will was concerning the
Twelve, and the Lord answered in a 
revelation, given July 8th, 1838, in which
He says: "Let them take leave of my 
Saints in the city [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], on the 26th
day of April next, on the building spot 
of my house, saith the Lord. Let my 
servant [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], and also my ser-
vant [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]], and also my servant 
Wilford Woodruff, and also my servant 
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]], be appointed to fill 
the places of those who have fallen, and 
be officially notified of their appoint-
ment.'"
It will be observed that this differs
from nearly all other revelations in this 
respect: a fixed day and a stated place
were given for the commencement of 
the mission. When the revelation was
given, all was peace and quietude in Far
West, Missouri, the city where most of 
the Latter day Saints dwelt; but before 
the time came for its fulfillment, the
Saints of God had been driven out of 
the State of Missouri into the State of
[[Illinois|Illinois]], under the edict of Governor 
[[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]; and the Missourians had sworn
that if all the other revelations of Joseph
Smith were fulfilled, that should not be. 
It stated the day and the place where the
Twelve Apostles should take leave of the
Saints, to go on their missions across the 
great waters, and the mobocrats of Mis-
souri had declared that they would see 
that it should not be fulfilled.
It seemed as though the Lord, having
a foreknowledge of what would take 
place, had given the revelation in this
manner to see whether the Apostles 
would obey it at the risk of their lives.
When the time drew near for the ful-
fillment of this commandment of the 
Lord, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] was the President 
of the Twelve Apostles; Thomas B.
Marsh, who was the senior Apostle, had 
fallen. Brother Brigham called together
those of the Twelve who were then at 
[[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], Illinois, to see what their minds 
would be about going to Far West, to
fulfill the revelation. The Prophet Jos-
[Column 2]
eph and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], Sidney Rig-
don, [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]]
were in prison in Missouri at the time; 
but Father [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], the Patriarch,
was at Quincy, Illinois. He and others 
who were present did not think it wis-
dom for us to attempt the journey, as 
our lives would be in great jeopardy. 
They thought the Lord would take the
will for the deed. But when President 
Young asked the Twelve what our feel-
ings were upon the subject, we all of us, 
as the voice of one man, said the Lord 
God had spoken, and it was for us to 
obey. It was the Lord's business to take
care of His servants, and we would ful-
fill the commandment, or die trying.
To fully understand the risk the
Twelve ran in making this journey, my
readers should remember that Lilburn 
W. Boggs, governor of the State of Mis-
souri, had issued a proclamation, in 
which all the Latter-day Saints were re-
quired to leave that State or be exter-
minated. Far West had been captured 
by the militia, who were really only an
organized mob; the citizens had been
compelled to give up their arms; all the 
leading men who could be got hold of
had been taken prisoners; the rest of 
the Saintsâmen, women and childrenâ 
had to flee as best they could out of the 
State to save their lives, leaving all their 
houses, lands and other property which 
they could not carry with them to be 
taken by the mob. In fact they shot 
down the cattle and hogs of the Saints 
wherever they could find them, and 
robbed them of nearly everything they
could lay their hands upon. Latter-day
Saints were treated with merciless cruelty 
and had to endure the most outrageous 
abuses. It was with the greatest diffi-
culty that many of them got out of the 
State, especially the prominent men; for
there were many men of that State at 
that time, who acted as though they 
thought it no more harm to shoot a 
Mormon than a mad dog. From this 
brief explanation you will be able to un-
derstand why some of the brethren 
thought we were not required to go back 
to Far West to start from there upon our
mission across the ocean to Europe.
Having determined to carry out the [Column 1]
the end. When [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|she]] looked at the situ-
ation of her husband and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child]] she said: 
"Yes, I will do it."
At the moment that decision was
made the power of faith rested upon me, 
and when I administered unto her, her 
spirit entered her tabernacle, and she 
saw the messengers carry the coffin out
of the door.
On the morning of the 6th of Decem-
ber, the Spirit said to me, "Arise and 
continue thy journey," and through the
mercy of God my wife was enabled to 
arise and dress herself, and walked to the
wagon, and we went on our way re-
joicing.
On the night of the 11th I stopped
for the night at an inn, the weather be-
ing very cold. I there learned of the
sudden death of my brother, Asahel H. 
Woodruff, a merchant of [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]],
Indiana.
I had anticipated a joyful meeting 
with this brother on the following day. 
Instead of this, I only had the privilege 
of visiting his grave, in company with
my wife, and examining a little into his
business.
I was offered the position of admin-
[Column 2]
istrator of his affairs, but I was leading
a company of Saints to Zion, and could
not stop to attend to his temporal busi-
ness. Strangers settled his affairs and 
took possession of his property. His 
relatives obtained nothing from his effects 
but a few trifling mementos.
I left this place and crossed into
[[Illinois|Illinois]] on the 13th of December, and
arrived at [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] on the 19th, and, 
getting information of the severe perse-
cutions of the Saints in [[Missouri|Missouri]], and 
the unsettled state of the Church at that 
time, we concluded to stop at Rochester
and spend the winter.
Thus ended my journey of two months
and sixteen days, leading the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Island]] 
Saints to the west, through all the perils
of a journey of nearly two thousand 
miles, in the midst of sickness and great
severity of weather.
I took my family in the spring and 
removed to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], Illinois, where I 
could mingle with my brethren, and I
felt to praise God for His protecting care
over me and my family in all our
afflictions.

[Column 1]
The roads finally became so bad and 
the cold so severe that [[Nathaniel Thomas|Nathaniel Thomas]] 
and [[James Townsend|James Townsend]] concluded to stop
for the winter. We parted with them on 
the 21st of November, near [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]], 
Ohio.
On the 23rd of November my wife, 
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phoebe]], was attacked with a severe head-
ache, which terminated in brain fever. 
She grew more and more distressed daily 
as we continued our journey. It was a 
terrible ordeal for a woman to travel in 
a wagon over rough roads, afflicted as
she was. At the same time our [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child]] 
was also very sick.
The first of December was a trying
day to my soul. My wife continued to
fail, and in the afternoon, about four 
o'clock, she appeared to be struck with 
death. I stopped my team, and it 
seemed as though she would breath her
last lying in the wagon. Two of the 
sisters sat beside her, to see if they could
do anything for her in her last moments.
1 stood upon the ground, in deep af-
fliction, and meditated. I cried unto
the Lord, and prayed that she might live
and not be taken from me. I claimed the
promises the Lord had made unto me 
through the prophets and patriarchs, and
soon her spirit revived, and I drove a 
short distance to a tavern, and got her
into a room and worked over her and her
babe all night, and prayed to the Lord 
to preserve her life.
In the morning the circumstances were 
such that I was under the necessity of 
removing my wife from the inn, as there
was so much noise and confusion at the 
place that she could not endure it. I
carried her out to her bed in the wagon
and drove two miles, when I alighted at 
a house and carried my wife and her bed 
into it, with a determination to tarry
there until she recovered her health or
or passed away. This was on Sunday 
morning, December 2nd.
After getting my wife and things into
the house and wood provided to keep up
a fire, I employed my time in taking 
care of her. It looked as though she had 
but a short time to live.
She called me to her bedside in the
evening and said she felt as though a
few moments more would end her exist-
ence in this life. She manifested great 
confidence in the cause she had em-
braced, and exhorted me to have confi-
[Column 2]
dence in God, and to keep his com-
mandments.
To all appearances she was dying. I 
laid hands upon her and prayed for her,
and she soon revived and slept some dur-
ing the night.
December 3rd found my wife very low. 
I spent the day in taking care of her, 
and the following day I returned to 
[[Eaton, Preble County, Ohio|Eaton]] to get some things for her. She 
seemed to be gradually sinking, and in
the evening the spirit apparently left her 
body, and she was dead.
The sisters gathered around her body,
weeping, while I stood looking at her in
sorrow. The spirit and power of God 
began to rest upon me until, for the first
time during her sickness, faith filled my
soul, although she lay before me as one 
dead.
I had some oil that was consecrated
for my anointing while in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. I 
took it and consecrated it again before
the Lord for anointing the sick. I then
bowed down before the Lord and prayed
for the life of my companion, and I 
anointed her body with the oil in the
name of the Lord. I laid my hands
upon her, and in the name of Jesus 
Christ I rebuked the power of death and
the destroyer, and commanded the same
to depart from her and the spirit of life
to enter her body.
Her spirit returned to her body, and 
from that hour she was made whole; and 
we all felt to praise the name of God, 
and to trust in Him and keep His com-
mandments.
While this operation was going on 
with me (as my wife related afterwards) 
her spirit left her body, and she saw it 
lying upon the bed, and the sisters weep-
ing. She looked at them and at me, 
and upon her babe, and, while gazing
upon this scene, two personages came
into the room, carrying a coffin, and told
her they had come for her body. One
of these messengers told her she might
have her choiceâshe might go to rest in 
the spirit world, or, on one condition she 
could have the privilege of returning to
her tabernacle and continuing her labors
upon the earth. The condition was, if 
she felt that she could stand by her hus-
band, and with him pass through all the 
cares, trials, tribulations and afflictions 
of life which he would be called upon to
pass through for the gospel's sake unto AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
On the 30th of July, I left my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] 
and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child]] at Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]] and started
once more to visit [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]].
While holding meeting with the Saints 
at North [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]] on the 9th of 
August, I received a letter from Thomas 
B. Marsh, who was then President of the
Twelve Apostles, informing me that
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], the Prophet, had received
a revelation, naming as persons to be
chosen to fill the places of those who had 
fallen: [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]], [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], Wil-
ford Woodruff and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]].
President Marsh added, in his letter, 
"Know then, Brother Woodruff, by this,
that you are appointed to fill the place of 
one of the Twelve Apostles, and that it 
is agreeable to the word of the Lord, 
given very lately, that you should come
speedily to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and, on the 26th 
of April next, take your leave of the 
Saints here and depart for other climes
across the mighty deep."
The substance of this letter had been
revealed to me several weeks before, but
I had not named it to any person.
The time having now come for me to
prepare for leaving the islands, I had a 
desire to take with me all the Saints I 
could get to go to Zion. There had al-
ready been a line drawn upon the islands
between the Saints and those who had 
rejected the gospel, and the enemies
were very bitter against me and the work
of God I had labored to establish. They 
threatened my life, but the Saints were 
willing to stand by me.
I spent four days with the Saints visit-
ing them, holding meetings and encour-
aging them, while the devil was raging 
upon every hand.
I had baptized and organized into the 
Church nearly one hundred persons while
upon the islands, and there seemed a 
prospect of gathering about half of them 
with me, but the devil raged to such an 
extent that quite a number were terri-
fied.
The inhabitants of the islands had but
little acquaintance with the management
of horses or wagons; in fact, most of
them knew more about handling a shark
than a horse. However, in company 
with [[Nathaniel Thomas|Nathanial Thomas]], who had sold
his property and had money, I went to
the mainland and purchased ten new 
wagons, ten sets of harness and twenty
horses. When I got everything prepared
[Column 2]
for the company to start, I left the affairs 
with Brother Thomas, and went on ahead 
of the company to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]], to prepare 
my own family for the journey.
The outfit which I purchased for the 
company cost about two thousand dollars.
Before leaving Brother Thomas, I coun-
selled him in regard to the course to pur-
sue, and charged him not to be later
than the 1st of September in starting
from the mainland.
I arrived at Father Carter's on the 19th 
of August, and waited with great anxiety 
for the arrival of the company from the
islands, but instead of reaching there by 
the 1st of September they did not arrive 
till the 3rd of October; and when they 
did arrive the wagon covers were all fly-
ing in the breeze. It took a good day's 
work to nail down the covers, paint the
wagons and get prepared for the journey.
On the afternoon of the 9th of Octo-
ber, we took leave of Father Carter and
family, and started upon our journey of 
two thousand miles at this late season of
the year, taking my wife with a suckling 
babe at her breast with me, to lead a 
company of fifty-three souls from Maine 
to [[Illinois|Illinois]], and to spend nearly three
months in traveling in wagons, through
rain, mud, snow and frost. It was such
a trial as I never before had attempted 
during my experience as a minister of the
gospel.
On our arrival at [[Georgetown, Essex County, Massachusetts|Georgetown]] we were 
joined by Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. We 
traveled each day as far as we could go, 
and camped wherever night overtook us.
On the 13th of October, while cross-
ing the [[Green Mountains, Vermont|Green Mountains]], I was attacked 
with something resembling the cholera.
I was very sick. I stopped at a house
for about two hours, but the Elders ad-
ministered to me, and I revived.
On the 24th I was again taken sick, 
and my wife and child were also stricken
down. We also had several others sick 
in the company, through the exposure of 
the journey.
On the 31st we had our first snow 
storm, and the horses dragged our wagons
all day through mud, snow and water.
On the 2nd of November Elder Milton
Holmes left us, and took steamer for
[[Fairport, Monroe County, New York|Fairport]]; and two days afterwards a lit-
tle child of Nathaniel Thomas', about 
six years of age, died, and we had to
bury it at [[Westfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts|Westfield]].TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
On the 1st of July, 1838, one of the 
most interesting events transpired of my
whole life in the ministry.
When Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] gave me 
my patriarchal blessing, among the many 
wonderful things of my life, he promised 
me that I should bring my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house-
hold into the kingdom of God, and I 
felt that if ever I obtained the blessing,
the time had come for me to perform it.
By the help of God, I preached the
gospel faithfully to my father's house-
hold and to all that were with him, as 
well as to my other relatives, and I had 
appointed a meeting on Sunday, the 1st 
of July, at my father's home.
My father was believing my testimony, 
as were all in his household, but upon 
this occasion the devil was determined
to hinder the fulfillment of the promise
of the patriarch unto me.
It seemed as though Lucifer, the son 
of the morning, had gathered together
the hosts of hell and exerted his powers 
upon us all. Distress overwhelmed the 
whole household, and all were tempted
to reject the work. And it seemed as
though the same power would devour
me. 1 had to take to my bed for an 
hour before the time of meeting. I there 
prayed unto the Lord with my whole
soul for deliverance, for I knew the
power of the devil was exercised to hin-
der me from accomplishing what God
had promised me.
The Lord heard my prayer and an-
swered my petition, and when the hour
of meeting had come I arose from my 
bed, and could sing and shout for joy to 
think I had been delivered from the
power of the evil one.
Filled with the power of God, I stood 
up in the midst of the congregation and 
preached the gospel of Jesus Christ unto
the people in great plainness.
At the close of the meeting we assem-
bled on the banks of the Farmington
River, "because there was much water
there," and I led six of my friends into 
the river and baptized them for the re-
mission of their sins.
All of my father's household were in-
cluded in this number, according to the
promise of the Patriarch. They were
all relatives except [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]], who 
was a Methodist class-leader and was 
boarding with my father's family.
I organized the small number of nine
[Column 2]
persons, eight of whom were my relatives, 
into a branch of the Church, and or-
dained Dwight Webster to the office of a 
priest and administered the sacrament
unto them.
It was truly a day of joy to my soul. 
My father, [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]], and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] were
among the number baptized. I after-
wards added a number of relatives. I
felt that this day's work alone amply re-
paid me for all my labors in the min-
istry.
Now, as my mission to my native land 
was accomplished, which I felt im-
pressed to take while I was upon the
[[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]], I felt it my duty to return here.
Monday, July 2nd, 1838, was the last 
day and night I spent at my father's
home while upon this mission. At the
setting of the sun I took the last walk 
with my sister I ever had with her while 
in my native State. We walked by the
canal and viewed the river and the 
fields, and conversed upon our future
destiny.
After evening prayer with the family, 
my father retired to rest, and I spent a 
season with my stepmother, who had 
reared me from my infancy. In conver-
sation we felt sensibly the weight of the 
power of temptation, out of which the 
Lord had delivered us.
I also spent a short time with my sis-
ter Eunice, the only sister I was ever 
blessed with in my father's family. I 
had baptized her into the Church and
Kingdom of God, and we mingled our
sympathies, prayers, and tears together
before the throne of grace.
How truly are the bonds of consan-
guinity and of the blood of Christ united 
in binding the hearts of the Saints of
God together, and "how blessings 
brighten as they take their flight."
This being the last night I was to 
spend beneath my father's roof while 
upon this mission, I felt the weight of it, 
and my prayer was, "O, Lord, protect
my father's house, and bring him to 
Zion!" (which prayer was granted.)
On the morning of July 3rd, I took 
leave of my relatives and my native
land, and started on my return to
Maine.
I arrived in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]] on the 6th, and 
on the 14th my first childâa daughterâ
was born at Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]] house. We 
named her [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]].AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
it was for the gospel's sake and did not
choose to complain. The next day a 
walk of thirty miles brought us to Scar-
boro, where we spent the night at Father
[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]].
On the 8th of May I parted with Mrs. 
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and Father Carter and family, 
and in company with [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] 
walked thirty-three miles towards Ports-
mouth, which city we reached the fol-
lowing day and spent several hours there, 
visiting the navy yard. We then walked 
to [[Georgetown, Essex County, Massachusetts|Georgetown]], formerly [[New Rowley, Essex County, Massachusetts|New Rowley]], 
and spent the night with Father Na-
thaniel Holmes.
On the 11th of May I visited Charles-
ton and [[Bunker Hill Monument, Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Bunker Hill monument]], and also
spent several hours in the city of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]], 
which then contained a population of
one hundred thousand. I ascended to 
the cupola of the court house, from 
which I had a fine view of the city. I 
visited several of the Saints in the city,
and walked over the long bridge to 
[[Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]].
I visited the jail there in order to have
an interview with Brother A. P. Rock-
wood, who had been cast into prison on
the plea of debt, in order to trouble and 
distress him, because he was a Mormon. 
This was the first time we had ever met. 
The jailor permitted me to enter the 
room where he was. It was the first time
in my life I had ever entered a prison. 
The jailor turned the key upon us and 
locked us both in.
I found Brother Rockwood strong in 
the faith of the gospel. He had the 
Bible, Book of Mormon, Voice of Warn-
ing and Evening and Morning Star as 
his companions, which he read daily.
We conversed together for three hours
in this solitary abode. He informed me
of many things which had transpired 
while he was confined there as a prisoner.
Among other things, he mentioned that 
the jail had taken fire a few days previous 
to my visit. He said it looked a little
like a dark hour. The fire was roaring
over his head, while uproar and confu-
sion were upon every hand. Fire engines 
were rapidly playing around the build-
ing, with water pouring into every room.
The people were hallooing in the streets.
Prisoners were begging for mercy's sake
to be let out, or they would be consumed
in the fire. One was struggling in the 
agonies of death, while others were
[Column 2]
cursing and swearing. Brother Rock-
wood said he felt composed in the midst 
of it until the fire was extinguished.
At eight o'clock the jailor unlocked the
prison door to let me out, and I gave
the parting hand to the prisoner of hope.
We had spent a pleasant time together,
and he rejoiced at my visit; and who 
would not, to meet with a friend in a
lonely prison? I left him in good spirits, 
and wended my way back to Boston.
I spent several days in Boston, hold-
ing meetings with the Saints there, and 
then walked to [[Providence, Providence County, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode 
Island, preaching by the way.
I there took steamer and arrived in
[[New York|New York]] on the 18th of May, where I 
met with Elder [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and his 
family, and [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]] and near 
one hundred Saints who had been bap-
tized in the city of [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]].
I spent three days in New York visit-
ing the Saints and holding meetings. 
Several new converts were baptized while
I was there.
Leaving New York, I traveled through 
[[New Jersey|New Jersey]], and returned to Farming-
ton, Connecticut, the residence of my
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]. I arrived at his house on the
12th of June.
It was with peculiar sensations that I 
walked over my native land, where I 
spent my youth, and cast my eyes over 
the Farmington meadows and the hills
and dales where I had roamed in my
boyhood with my father, [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step mother]], 
brothers and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|half-sister]].
On my arrival at my father's home I 
had the happy privilege of again taking
my parents and sister by the hand, also
my uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]], who was 
among the number I had baptized the
year before.
After spending an hour in conversa-
tion, we sat down around our father's 
table and supped together and were re-
freshed. Then we bowed upon our 
knees together in the family circle and
offered up the gratitude of our hearts to
God for preserving our lives and reunit-
ing us.
I spent the next eighteen days in
Farmington and [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], visiting my 
father's household, my uncles, aunts 
cousins, neighbors and friends, preach-
ing the gospel of Jesus Christ unto them
and striving to bring them into the
kingdom of God.TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
While this thought was in his mind a 
large fish arose to the top of the water, a 
distance from him in the sea, and sud-
denly sank out of sight. He much de-
sired to see it again, and soon it arose 
to the top of the water, accompanied by 
another fish of about the same size, and 
one of them swam on the water in a 
straight line towards Mr. [[Ebenezer Carver|Carver]] as he 
stood upon the shore. It came as near 
to him the water would permit, and 
then stopped and gazed at him with a 
penetrating eye, as though it had a mes-
sage for him. It then returned to its 
mate in the ocean, and swam out of sight.
Mr. Carver retraced his steps home-
ward, meditating upon the scene and the 
wonderful condescension of the Lord.
It is proper to remark that this was at 
a season of the year when fish of that 
size are never known upon those shores 
or seas, and they are never, at any sea-
son, known to come ashore as in the 
case mentioned.
Mr. Carver was convinced that it was 
intended by the Lord as a sign to him.
Two days after this event I visited Mr. 
Carver at his house, and found his [[Mary Stinson Carver|wife]] 
confined to her bed with a fever, and 
she requested me to administer to her. I 
placed my hands upon her head, the 
power of God rested upon me, and I 
commanded her in the name of Jesus 
Christ to arise and walk.
She arose and was healed from that 
instant, and she walked down to the sea 
and I baptized her in the same place 
where the fish visited her husband. I 
confirmed her there, and she was filled 
with the Holy Ghost, and returned to 
her home rejoicing.
I now called the people together and 
exhorted them to sell their property and 
prepare to accompany me to the land of 
Zion. I had labored hard for many days 
for the temporal and spiritual welfare of 
the inhabitants of those [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]], and the 
Lord had blessed my labors and given 
me many souls as seals of my ministry, 
for which I felt to praise Him; and now 
I felt to labor quite as zealously to gather 
out those who had embraced the gospel, 
and lead them to Zion.
The worst difficulty which the Saints 
had to contend with in that day was 
from false brethren. [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]], 
who had been a prominent elder in the 
Church, and had labored with me as a
[Column 2]
missionary, had apostatized and been cut 
off from the Church. Learning that I 
was building up branches of the Church 
upon the island, he and other apostates 
conspired to block up my way by writing 
lies to the people and stirring up a spirit 
of mobocracy upon the islands.
They succeeded in exerting a strong 
influence with the wicked, but I knew 
they could not hinder the work of God.
On the 6th of April I held a meeting 
at Brother Ebenezer Carver's, and, 
though the hearts of the wicked were 
stirred up in bitterness against me, the 
Spirit of God was with me, and at the 
close of the meeting I baptized three 
persons. One of these was Mrs. Abi-
gail Carver, the mother of Ebenezer 
Carver, who was seventy years of age 
and in poor health. She had not so 
much as visited a neighbor's house for 
six years, but upon this occasion she 
walked with boldness to the sea shore 
and I baptized her, and she returned 
rejoicing.
On the 11th of April I had the happy 
privilege of again meeting with Elders 
[[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]], [[James Townsend|James Townsend]] and 
[[Abner Rogers|Abner Rogers]], who had come to the
islands to attend conference with me.
We held our conference on the 13th 
of April, on [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Fox Island]], and had 
a representation of the different branches 
on the islands. We also preached and 
bore our testimony, ordained several and 
baptized one person at the close of the 
meeting.
On the 17th of April Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]]
left the islands to return to her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]] 
home in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]], Maine, and a few 
days afterwards I called the Saints of the 
North Island together and communed 
with and instructed them. I also in-
formed them that the Spirit of God bore 
record to me that it was our duty to 
leave the islands for a season and take a 
western mission. They had been faith-
fully warned and the Saints were estab-
lished in the truth, while the wicked 
were contending against us, and some 
were disposed to take our lives if they 
had the power.
On the 28th of April we left the island 
in an open sail-boat and made our way 
to [[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owl's Head]], and then walked twenty 
miles. The following day we walked 
forty miles and suffered some with weary 
limbs and blistered feet, but we felt that AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
and [[Thomas B. Teppley|he]] felt impressed to say, "Walk in, 
gentlemen."
There is probably no other chapter in 
the whole book that would have the same 
influence in causing any one to feed a 
person who professed to be a servant of 
God and asked for bread.
After becoming acquainted with his 
circumstances I thought it providential 
that we were led to his house, for al-
though he was a professor of religion and 
a Methodist, he was in a state of despair, 
believing that he had committed the un-
pardonable sin.
However, I told him what the unpar-
donable sin was, and that he had not 
committed it, but that it was a trick of 
the devil to make him think so, in order 
to torment him. He then acknowledged 
that he went down to the wharf a few 
evenings before, with the intention of 
drowning himself, but when he looked 
into the cold, dark water, he desisted 
and returned home, and had said nothing 
previous to anyone about it.
I taught him the principles of the 
gospel, which proved a comfort to him. 
We spent the following day in visiting 
the people of [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], and in the evening 
preached in a brick school house, pro-
vided by Mr. Teppley, and many wished 
to hear more from us.
We next visited [[Northport, Waldo County, Maine|Northport]] and Frank-
fort, holding meetings at both places, 
and on the 1st of March, 1838, we en-
tered [[Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine|Bangor]], which at that time had a 
population of ten thousand. This was 
my birthday, I being thirty-one years of 
age.
I visited some of the leading men of 
Bangor, and they granted me the use of 
the City Hall, where I preached to good 
audiences for two successive evenings. 
This was the first time a Latter-day 
Saint Elder had preached in that town. 
Many were anxious to learn more about 
our principles, but our visits through all 
the towns from [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] to Bangor 
were necessarily brief, owing to our ap-
pointments upon the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Islands]]. It was 
like casting our bread upon the waters 
and trusting in God for the result.
On the 5th of March we sailed from 
[[Penobscot, Penobscot County, Maine|Penobscot]] for the [[Isle of Holt, Knox County, Maine|Isle of Holt]], where I 
held a meeting on the following evening.
The next day I took passage on the 
mail boat for the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]], where I 
again had the privilege of meeting with
[Column 2]
the Saints for prayer and praise before 
the Lord.
On my arrival I received a package of 
letters from friends abroad. One was 
from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and gave an account of 
the apostasy and tribulations which the 
Saints were passing through. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] 
the Prophet and others, with their fam-
ilies, had gone to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and the 
Saints were following him.
Brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] returned home and 
I was again left alone in the ministry.
On the afternoon of the 22nd of March, 
Brother [[Cyrus Starrett|Sterrett]] and I, accompanied by 
[[Phebe Philbrook Starrett|our]] [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wives]], went several hundred yards 
from the shore to a sand-bar (it being 
now low tide), to dig clams. The 
ground near the shore was much lower 
than the bar we were on, and while we 
were all busy digging clams and talking 
Mormonism, the dashing of the waves 
of the incoming tide against the shore 
suddenly made us conscious that we had 
fifty yards of water between us and the 
shore.
The surf waves also added to our diffi-
culty, and as we had no boat, our only 
alternattve was to cross our four arms, 
thus forming a kind of arm chair for our 
wives to sit upon, and carry them in 
turn to the shore, wading through two 
and a half feet of water.
By the time that we got our wives and 
clams safely landed, the truth of the 
old saying was firmly impressed upon our 
minds, that "Time and tide wait for no 
man," not even for a preacher of the 
gospel.
On the 28th of March I received a 
letter from Zion, requesting me to coun-
sel the Saints I had baptized to sell their 
property and gather up to Zion.
About this time the Lord was mani-
festing himself upon the islands in vari-
ous ways, by dreams, visions, healings, 
signs and wonders. I will relate one 
peculiar circumstance of this kind that 
occurred.
Mr. [[Ebenezer Carver|Ebenezer Carver]] had been inves-
tigating our doctrines for quite a length 
of time, and, having a great desire to 
know the truth of our religion, he walked 
to the sea shore, wishing that he might 
have some manifestation in proof of its 
truth.
The passage of Scripture came to his 
mind that there would be no sign given 
"but the sign of the prophet Jonas."TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]]. Here I found that 
the seed I had sown was bringing forth 
fruit. Six persons were ready for bap-
tism.
But my mission to these [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]] was 
not an exception to the general rule: 
success did not come without many 
obstacles presenting themselves. Those 
who rejected the word were frequently 
inspired by the evil one to make an 
attempt at persecution.
Some of those who felt to oppose me 
went down to the harbor and got a 
swivel and small arms, and planted them 
close by the school house, near the sea 
shore, and while I was speaking they 
commenced firing their cannon and guns. 
I continued speaking in great plainness, 
but my voice was mingled with the re-
port of musketry.
I told the people my garments were 
clear of the blood of the inhabitants of 
that island, and asked if any wished to 
embrace the gospel. Two persons came 
forward and wished to be baptized, and 
I baptized them.
On the following day when I went 
down to the seaside to baptize a man, 
the rabble commenced firing guns again, 
as on the previous night. I afterwards 
learned that notices were posted up, 
warning me to leave the town, but I 
thought it was better to obey God than 
man, and, therefore, did not go.
The next day I baptized three persons, 
and two days subsequently a couple of 
others.
I had ample evidence of the fact that 
lying spirits had gone out into the world, 
for three persons whom I had baptized 
had been visited by Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglass]], who 
told them that I denied the Bible and 
could not be depended upon; and they 
yielded to his insinuations until the devil 
took possession of them, and they were in 
a disaffected condition, and sent for me.
When I met them they were in great 
affliction, but when I instructed them in 
regard to the principles of the gospel, 
and administered to them, they were 
delivered from the evil influence and 
rejoiced.
On the 15th of February I again 
crossed to the North Island, and after 
remaining there seven days visiting, we 
returned to [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]]. Here I met Brother 
[[James Townsend|James Townsend]], who had just arrived 
from [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]].
[Column 2]
I ordained Brother Townsend to the 
office of an elder, and we concluded to 
take a journey to [[Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine|Bangor]], and offer the 
gospel to the inhabitants of that city.
We undertook the journey on foot in 
the dead of winter, when the snow was 
very deep, and the first day broke the 
road for seven miles to [[Searsmont, Waldo County, Maine|Scarsmont]]. The 
day following, it being Sunday, we held 
two meetings, preached the gospel to the 
people, and were kindly entertained.
On the evening of the next day we 
wallowed through snowdrifts for a mile, 
to meet an appointment to preach in a 
schoolhouse, and I got one of my ears 
frozen on the way; but notwithstanding 
the severity of the weather, we had a 
large and attentive audience. We also 
spent the next two days with the people 
there and held meetings.
On the evening of the 21st of Febru-
ary, as we came out of the school-house, 
a light appeared on the northeastern 
horizon, and spread to the west, and 
soon rolled over our heads. It had the 
appearance of fire, blood, and smoke, 
and at times resembled contending ar-
mies. The heavens were illuminated for 
the space of half an hour. It seemed at 
times as though the veil was about to rend 
in twain, and the elements were contend-
ing with each other.
We looked upon it as one of the signs 
in the heavens predicted by the prophets 
of old, as to appear in the last days. We 
were wading through deep snowdrifts 
most of the time while witnessing this 
remarkable scene.
The following day we walked fifteen 
miles through deep snow to [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], and, 
after being refused lodging for the night 
by eight families, we were kindly enter-
tained by a Mr. [[Thomas B. Teppley|Thomas Teppley]].
There was an interesting incident con-
nected with our stay at his house. After 
eating our supper, it being late in the 
evening. Mr. Teppley placed a stand 
before me with a Bible upon it, asking 
me to read a chapter and have prayers 
with them, he being a religious man.
I opened the Bible mechanically, when 
the 25th chapter of Matthew being the 
first to catch my eye, I read it, and as I 
closed the book Mr. Teppley turned to 
his wife and said, "Is not this a strange 
thing?" Then he explained to us that 
he had just read that chapter and closed 
the book when we rapped at the door,AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
We retired to a grove and knelt down 
and prayed together, and had a good 
time, and, after commending each other 
to God, we parted, [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|he]] to return to Kirt-
land and I to [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]].
I spent fourteen days visiting the 
Saints and friends, and holding meetings 
among them, and on the 28th of Octo-
ber I took leave of Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter]] and 
and family, and in company with my 
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] rode to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]], and spent the 
night with my brother-in-law, Ezra 
Carter.
A severe storm arose, so we could not 
go to sea until November 1st, when we 
took steamer to [[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owl's Head]], carriage to 
[[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] and sloop to Fox Islands.
My second visit to these islands was 
made under very different circumstances 
to the first. On my first visit I was an 
entire stranger to the people, and they 
were strangers to the gospel, but upon 
my second I met many Saints who had 
received the gospel, and who hailed me, 
and my companion also, with glad 
hearts.
On Sunday, the 5th of November, I 
met with a large assembly of Saints and 
friends, and again commenced baptizing
such as would receive my testimony.
After visiting the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]] and 
holding meetings with the Saints there,
and baptizing two after meeting, I em-
barked on board a sloop, with Captain 
[[Benjamin Coombs|Coombs]], for another island called the 
[[Isle of Holt, Knox County, Maine|Isle of Holt]]. We arrived at noon, and 
I preached to the people at night in their 
school house, and had an attentive 
audience. I spent the night with John 
Turner, Esq., who purchased a copy of 
the Book of Mormon.
On the following day we returned to 
Fox Islands, and as St. Paul once had to 
row hard to make the land in a storm, 
we had to row hard to make it in a 
calm.
After preaching on the North Island 
again and baptizing two persons at the 
close of the meeting, I returned again to 
the mainland in company with Mrs. 
Woodruff and others, where I spent fif-
teen days, during which time I visited 
among the people, held twelve meetings 
and baptized several persons.
On the 13th of December I returned 
again to the North Island, where I held 
several meetings, and then crossed over 
to the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]].
[Column 2]
On the 20th of December I spent an 
hour with Mr. [[Isaac Crockett|Isaac Crockett]] in clearing 
away large blocks of ice from the water 
in a cove, in order to baptize him, which
I did when the tide came in. I also
baptized two more in the same place on 
the 26th, and again two others on the
27th.
On the 28th I held a meeting at a 
school house, when [[William Douglass|William Douglass]],
the Methodist minister, came and wanted 
me to work a miracle, that he might be-
lieve, and otherwise railed against me.
I told him what class of men asked 
for signs, and that he was a wicked and 
adulterous man, and predicted that the 
curse of God would rest upon him, and 
that his wickedness would be made mani-
fest in the eyes of the people. (While 
visiting these Islands several years after-
wards I learned that the prediction had 
really been fulfilled, and that he was 
serving out a fourteen years' term of 
imprisonment for a beastly crime).
Mrs. Woodruff crossed the thorough-
fare in a boat and walked ten miles, the 
length of the island, to meet me, on the 
last day of the year. I held a meeting
the same day in the school house, and at 
the close of the meeting baptized two 
persons in the sea, at full tide, before a
large assembly.
January 1st, 1838, found me standing 
upon one of the islands of the sea, a 
minister of the gospel of life and salva-
tion unto the people, laboring alone, 
though blessed with the society of Mrs. 
Woodruff, my companion. I had been 
declaring the word of the Lord through 
the islands many days, the Spirit of God 
was working among the people, preju-
dice was giving way, and the power of 
God was manifest by signs following 
those who believed.
I spent this New Year's Day visiting 
the Saints and their neighbors, and met a 
congregation at Captain [[Charles Brown|Charles Brown's]],
where I spoke to them for awhile, and at 
the close of my remarks led three per-
sons down into the sea and baptized 
them. Two of these were sea captains, 
namely, Charles Brown, and Jesse 
Coombs, and the third was the [[Mrs. Jesse Coombs|wife]] of 
Captain Coombs. After confirming them 
we spent the evening in preaching, sing-
ing and praying.
I held meetings almost daily with the 
Saints up to the 13th, when I crossed to TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE
[Column 1]
remarks against the Book of Mormon 
and our principles.
I spoke two and a half hours, and an-
swered every objection against the Book 
of Mormon, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], or our prin-
ciples.
I had good attention and the people 
seemed satisfied. At the close of the 
meeting Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] administered the 
ordinance of baptism.
Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], in order to save his 
cause, went to the [[Maine|mainland]] and brought 
over several ministers with him and held 
a protracted meeting. They hoped by 
this to stop the work of God, but all to 
no avail, for the whole people would 
attend our meeting and receive the word 
of God, and we continued to baptize.
We visited the dwellings of most of 
inhabitants during our sojourn there.
Upon one occasion, while standing 
upon Mr. [[Ebenezer Carver|Carver's]] farm, on the east end 
of the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]], we counted fifty-
five islands in that region, the majority 
of which were not inhabited. We also 
saw twenty ships under sail at the same 
time.
We had no lack for food while upon 
the island, for if we did not wish to 
trouble our friends for a dinner, we only 
had to borrow a spade or a hoe, and a 
kettle and go to the beach and dig a 
peck of clams. These, when boiled, 
would make a delicious meal, which we 
often availed ourselves of.
One day Elder Hale and I ascended 
to the top of a high granite rock 
on the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]], for prayer and sup-
plication. We sat down under the shade
of a pine tree which grew out of a fis-
sure in the rock, and Elder Hale read 
the sixteenth chapter of Jeremiah, where 
mention is made of the hunters and 
fishers that God would send in the last 
days to gather Israel.
Of a truth here we were upon an island 
of the sea, standing upon a rock where 
we could survey the gallant ships and 
also the islands, which were as full of 
rocks, ledges, and caves as any part of the 
earth. And what had brought us here? 
To search out the blood of Ephraim,
the honest and meek of the earth, and 
gather them from those islands, rocks, 
holes, and caves of the earth unto Zion.
We prayed, and rejoiced together. 
The Spirit of God rested upon us; we 
spoke of Christ and the ancient prophets
[Column 2]
and apostles in Jerusalem; of Nephi, 
Alma, Mormon, and Moroni in America; 
Joseph, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver]], and the apostles 
in our own day, and we rejoiced that we 
were upon the islands of the sea search-
ing out the blood of Israel.
While being filled with these medita-
tions and the Spirit of God, we fell 
upon our knees and gave thanks to the 
God of heaven, and felt to pray for
all Israel.
After spending most of the day in 
praise and thanksgiving, we descended 
to the settlement and held a meeting 
with the people.
On the 6th of September we called 
upon Captain [[Benjamin Coombs|Benjamin Coombs]], and 
visited his flakes, where he had one
thousand quintals of codfish drying for 
the market. They had mostly been 
caught in the region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. 
While we were passing [[Carvey's Wharf, Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Carvey's Wharf]] 
our attention was called to a large school 
of mackerel playing by the side of the 
wharf. Several men were pitching them 
out with hooks. We also flung in a hook 
and caught all we wanted, then went on 
our way.
We continued to labor, preaching and 
baptizing, and organized a branch of 
the Church upon each island, and, 
finally, on the second of October, we 
parted with the Saints on the North 
Island to return to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]] for a short 
time.
We walked from [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] to [[Bath, Sagadahoc County, Maine|Bath]], a 
distance of forty-six miles, in one day, 
and at the latter place attended a Bap-
tist convention. I also preached there 
to a large congregation in the evening, 
and the people gave good attention and 
wished to learn more about our doc-
trines.
On the following day we walked thirty-
six miles to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]], and the next day 
to Scarboro. Here I again met with my 
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]] family.
The time had come for me to give the 
parting hand to Brother Jonathan H. 
Hale. We had traveled during the sea-
son over two thousand miles together, 
with our hearts and spirits well united.
He felt it his duty to return to his 
family at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], but duty called me to 
return to my field of labor upon the 
islands.
On the 9th of October I accompanied 
Brother Hale one mile upon his journey. AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
us to the meeting-house, where we met a 
large congregation, none of whom knew 
who we were, or anything about our 
profession, except the minister.
Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] and I went to the stand, 
and I arose with peculiar feelings and 
addressed the congregation for one hour, 
taking for my text Galatians i. 8â9.
This was the first time that I or any 
other elder of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints had (to my 
knowledge) attempted to preach the 
the fullness of the gospel and the Book
of Mormon to the inhabitants of any 
island of the sea.
I had much liberty in speaking, and 
informed the people that the Lord had 
raised up a prophet and organized His 
Church as in the days of Christ and the 
ancient apostles, with prophets, apostles, 
and the gifts as anciently, and that He 
had brought forth the Book of Mormon.
At the close of my remarks Elder Hale 
bore testimony.
I gave liberty for any one to speak 
that might wish to. As no one re-
sponded, I announced that we would 
hold meetings the next four evenings at 
the school-houses, beginning at No. I.
During the first thirteen days of our 
sojourn upon the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|island]] we preached 
seventeen discourses, being invited by 
the people to tarry with them. I left a 
copy of the Doctrine and Covenants 
with Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]] for his perusal.
He read it, and the Spirit of God 
bore testimony to him of its truth. He 
pondered over it for days, and he walked 
his room until midnight trying to decide 
whether to receive or reject it. He and 
his family attended about a dozen of my 
first meetings, and then he made up his 
mind, contrary to the dictation of the 
Spirit ol God to him, to reject the testi-
mony and come out against me. How-
ever, we commenced baptizing his flock.
The first two we baptized were a sea 
captain, by the name of [[Justus Ames|Justin Eames]], 
and his [[Betsey Hudson Ames|wife]]. Brother Jonathan H. 
Hale went down into the sea and bap-
tized them on the 3rd of September, and 
these were the first baptisms performed 
by proper authority upon any of the 
islands of the sea (to my knowledge) in 
this dispensation.
Before we left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] some of the 
leading apostates there had tried to dis-
courage Brother Hale about going on his
[Column 2]
mission, telling him he would never bap-
tize any one, and he had better remain 
at home. When Captain Eames offered 
himself for baptism, I told Brother Hale 
to go and baptize him, and prove those 
men false prophets, and he did so.
On the following Sabbath I baptized 
his brother, [[Ebenezer Eames|Ebenezer Eames]], another 
sea captain, and a young lady.
Mr. Newton, the Baptist minister, now 
commenced a war against us, and sent to 
the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]] for a Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglas]], a 
Methodist minister (with whom he had 
been at variance for years) to come over 
and help him put down "Mormonism."
Mr. Douglas came over, and they got 
as many people together as they could 
and held a conference. He railed against
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], the prophet, and the Book of 
Mormon, and, taking that book in his 
hand, with out-stretched arm, declared 
that he feared none of the judgments of 
God that would come upon him for re-
jecting it as the word of God, (I never 
heard what his sentiments upon this sub-
ject were at the end of his term of 
fourteen years' imprisonment in the 
[[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] Penitentiary, for an outrage 
upon his daughter, the judgment of 
which was given upon the testimony of 
his wife and daughter.)
I was present and heard Mr. Douglass' 
speech upon this occasion, and took 
minutes of the same. When he closed I 
arose and informed the people that I 
would meet with them next Sunday 
in the meeting-house, and answer Mr. 
Douglass, and wished him, as well as the 
people to be present.
I informed the people that Mr. Doug-
lass had made many false statements 
against Joseph Smith and the Latter-day 
Saints, with whom he had no acquain-
tance, and he had misquoted much Scrip-
ture, all of which I could correct.
We continued to baptize the people on 
the North Island until we baptized every 
person who owned an interest in the 
Baptist meeting-house. I then followed 
Mr. Douglass home to the South Island, 
and preached the gospel to and baptized 
nearly all the members of his church.
The excitement became great on both 
islands, and on Sunday, the 17th of 
September, I met a large assembly from 
both islands, and took the same subject 
that Mr. Douglass had dwelt upon in his TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.

earth I ever saw. It would be difficult 
for any person to describe it. It is about 
ten miles in length by five in width, and 
is one universal mass of rocks, formed 
into shelves, hills, and valleys, and cut 
up into necks and points to make room 
for the coves and harbors that run 
through and through the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|island]].
The population was 1,000. The in-
habitants got their living entirely by 
fishing. There is no chance for farming 
upon the island, and but a few garden 
patches, which are cultivated at great 
expense. Some few sheep are raised 
there.
Many of the inhabitants fish in the 
region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and bring 
their fish home and cure them on flakes 
and prepare them for the market. They 
supply the market with great quantities 
of cod, mackerel and boxed herring.
Upon this island there were two stores,
three tide saw mills, six school houses 
and a small branch of the Methodist 
church, presided over by a priest.
What timber there is upon this island,
such as pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and 
birch, and the whortleberries, raspberries
and gooseberries, mostly grow out of 
the cracks of the rocks.
Great quantities of fish, and in almost 
endless variety, inhabit the coves and 
harbors around the islands. The whale, 
blackfish, shark, ground shark, pilot-fish, 
horse mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, hali-
but, cod, polleck, tom cod, hake, had-
dock, mackerel, shad bass, alewife,
herring, pohagen, dolphin, whiting, 
frost-fish, flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, 
skid, cusk, blueback, scollop, dogfish, 
muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five-fingers, 
monkfish, horsefish, sunfish, swordfish, 
thrasher, cat, scuppog, tootog, eyefish, 
cunner, ling, also the eel, lobster, clam, 
muscle, periwinkle, porpoise, seal, etc., 
are found there.
Thus I have given a brief description
of [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]]. It was quite dark 
when we landed there, without a farthing
in money. We made our way over the 
rocks and through the cedars the best 
way we could, until we found a house, 
when we rapped at the door. A woman
put her head out of the window and asked 
who was there and what was wanted.
I told her we were two strangers, and 
wanted a bed to lie down upon until 
morning.
[Column 2]
She let us in and gave us a bed, and 
we slept until quite late, it being Sunday 
morning. When we came out and took 
breakfast it was nearly noon. I asked 
her what she charged for our entertain-
ment, and she replied that we were wel-
come.
I then asked her if there was any 
religion or minister or church on the 
island.
She informed me there was a Baptist 
minister, by the name of [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], who 
had a congregation and meeting house 
about five miles from there.
We thanked her for her kindness, 
walked to the meeting house and stepped 
inside the doorway. We stood there 
until a deacon came to the door, when I 
asked him to go and tell the minister in 
the pulpit that there were two servants 
of God at the door, who had a message
to deliver to that people and wished the 
privilege of delivering it.
He sent for us to come to the pulpit, 
so we walked through the congregation 
with our valises under our arms, and 
took a seat by the side of the minister, 
who was about to speak as we came to 
the door.
He arose and delivered his discourse 
to the people, occupying about half an 
hour. When he closed he asked me 
what was my wish.
1 told him we wished to speak to the 
people at any hour that would suit his 
or their convenience; so he gave notice 
that there were two strangers present
who would speak to the people at five
o'clock that evening.
We were quite a source of wonder-
ment to the people, as they had no idea 
who we were.
Mr. Newton asked us home to tea 
with him, and we gladly accepted the 
invitation. When we arrived at his 
house I opened my valise and took out 
the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doc-
trine and Covenants, laid them upon 
the table, and took my seat.
Mr. Newton took up the books and 
looked at them, but said nothing. I 
then asked him if there were any school 
houses upon the island. and if so, 
whether they were free to preach in. 
He answered that there were four, num-
bered respectively from one to four, and 
that they were free.

After visiting with my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] a day or 
two, I returned to [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], where most of 
my relatives lived, and held meetings 
with them, and on the 12th of June, 
1837, I baptized my uncle, Ozem Wood-
ruff, his wife [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah]], and his son [[John Woodruff|John]], 
and we rejoiced together, for this was in 
fulfillment of a dream I had in 1818, 
when I was eleven years of age.
On the 15th of July I had an appoint-
ment to preach at the house of my uncle, 
[[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart]]. While there I had the 
happy privilege of meeting with my wife,
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phoebe W. Woodruff]], who had come 
from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] to meet me and accom-
pany me to her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]] home in Scar-
boro, Maine.
Those who had assembled to hear me 
preach were relatives, neighbors and for-
mer friends. After meeting, we returned 
to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] to my father's home, 
where I spent the night with my father, 
[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-mother]], [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] and wife. Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] 
was also with us.
On the 19th of July, Elder Hale left 
us to go to his friends in [[New Rowley, Essex County, Massachusetts|New Rowley]], 
Massachusetts, and on the same evening 
I held a meeting in the Methodist meet-
ing house in the town of Farmington. 
I had a large congregation of citizens, 
with whom I had been acquainted from 
my youth. My parents, wife and sister 
attended the meeting. The congrega-
tion seemed satisfied with the doctrines 
I taught, and they requested me to hold 
another meeting; but I felt anxious to 
continue my journey, and on the 20th of 
July I parted from my father, step-
mother and sister, and took stage for 
[[Hartford, Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford]] with my wife.
On my arrival at Hartford, not having 
money to pay the fare of both of us, I 
paid my wife's fare to Rowley, Massa-
chusetts, where there was a branch of 
the Church, presided over by Brother 
[[Nathaniel Holmes|Nathaniel Holmes]], father of [[Jonathan Harriman Holmes|Jonathan]] 
and [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]], and I journeyed on 
foot.
The first day I walked fifty-two miles, 
the second day forty-eight, and the third 
day thirty-six miles, and arrived at Row-
ley at two o'clock, making one hundred 
and thirty-six miles in a little over two 
and a half days.
I spent eight days at New Rowley, 
holding meetings and visiting the Saints, 
including the Holmes family, and left 
there on the 1st of August.
[Column 2]
On the 8th of August, in company 
with my wife and Elder Hale, I visited 
my wife's father, Ezra Carter, and his 
family in Scarboro, Maine, it being the 
first time I had ever seen any of her 
relatives. We were very kindly received. 
My wife had been absent from her 
father's home about one year.
I spent eight days with Father Carter 
and household, and one day I went out 
to sea with [[Fabyan Carter|Fabian]] and [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra Carter]], my 
brothers-in-law, in a boat, to fish with 
hooks. We caught two hundred and 
fifty cod, haddock and hake, and we saw 
four whales, two at a time, it being the 
first time in my life I had ever seen the 
kind of a fish which is said to have 
swallowed Jonah.
On the 18th of August, 1837, 1 parted 
with my wife and her father's household, 
leaving her with them, and, in company 
with Jonathan H. Hale, started upon the 
mission that I had in view when I left 
Kirtland.
We walked ten miles to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]], and 
took passage on the steamboat Bangor, 
which carried us to [[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owl's Head]], where 
we went on board of a sloop which 
landed us on [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Fox Island]] at 2 
o'clock, A.M., on the 20th.
The town of [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]] includes 
both North and [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Fox Islands]], in 
latitude 44Â° north, and longitude 69Â° 10' 
west. The population numbered, at the 
time of my visit, about 1,800. The in-
habitants were intelligent and indus-
trious, and hospitable to strangers. They 
got most of their wealth and living by 
fishing. The town fitted out over one 
hundred licensed sailing vessels, besides 
smaller craft.
North Fox Island is nine miles long 
by two miles in width and had a popula-
tion of 800. They had a post office, 
one store, a Baptist church and meeting 
house, four school houses and a tide 
grist mill.
The land was rather poor, yet there 
were some good farms. The products 
were wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and 
grass. The principal timber was fir, 
spruce, hemlock and birch. Raspberries 
and gooseberries grew in great abun-
dance, and some up-land cranberries 
were raised. The principal stock of the 
island were sheep.
South Fox Island comes as near being 
without any definite form as any spot onTULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
we were joined by Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. 
There we went aboard the steamer San-
dusky, and made our way to [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]], and 
proceeded thence to [[Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York|Syracuse]], by way of 
the [[Erie Canal, New York|Erie Canal]]. We then walked to 
[[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego County, New York, 
where I met my [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|two]] [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|brothers]], whom I 
had not seen for several years.
After spending one night there, we 
continued our journey to Sackett's Har-
bor, and crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]] on the 
steamer Oneida, to [[Kingston, Frontenac County, Canada West, British North America|Kingston]], Upper 
Canada, and from there also by steamer 
along the canal to [[Jones Falls, Canada West, British North America|Jones' Falls]], whence 
we walked to a place called [[Bastard, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Bastard]], 
Leeds County.
Here we found a branch of the Church, 
presided over by [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and 
[[James Blakesley|James Blakesly]]. We accompanied them 
to their place of meeting, and attended 
a conference with them, at which three 
hundred members of the Church were 
represented.
Thirty-two persons presented them-
selves for ordination, whom I was re-
quested to ordain, in company with 
Elder [[William Draper|William Draper]]. We ordained 
seven elders, nine priests, eleven teachers 
and five deacons.
We spoke to the people several times 
during this conference, and at its close 
we were called upon to administer to a 
woman who was possessed of the devil. 
At times she was dumb, and greatly 
afflicted with the evil spirits that dwelt in 
her. She believed in Jesus and in us as 
His servants, and wished us to adminis-
ter to her. Four of us laid our hands 
upon her head and commanded the 
devil, in the name of Jesus Christ, to 
depart out of her. It was immediately 
done, and the woman arose with great 
joy, and gave thanks and praise unto 
God; for, according to her faith, she 
was made whole from that hour.
A child, also, that was sick, was 
healed by the laying on of hands, ac-
cording to the word of God.
We walked thirty miles to visit another 
branch of the Saints at [[Leeds Township, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Leeds]], where 
we met with [[John Gordon|John Gordon]] and John 
Snider. Here we held a meeting and 
bore our testimony to the people.
A Sister Carns here came to us and 
requested to have the ordinance for the 
healing of the sick performed for two of 
her children who were afflicted. One 
was a suckling child, which was lying at
[Column 2]
the point of death. I took it in my 
arms and presented it before the elders, 
who laid their hands upon it, and it was 
made whole immediately, and I handed 
it back to the mother entirely healed.
We afterwards laid hands upon the 
other, when it was also healed. It was 
done by the power of God, in the name 
of Jesus Christ, and the parents praised 
God for His goodness.
After leaving the Saints in this place, 
we returned to Kingston, and crossed 
Lake Ontario in company with Isaac 
Russel, [[John Goodson|John Goodson]] and John Snider.
Brother Russell seemed to be con-
stantly troubled with evil spirits, which 
followed him when he subsequently went 
on a mission to [[England|England]], where Apostles 
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], 
when administering to him, had a severe 
contest with them, as Brother Kimball 
has related in his history.
Brothers Russell, Goodson and Snider 
continued with us to [[Schenectady, Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]], where 
they left us to proceed to New York, to 
join Elders Kimball and Hyde to go 
upon their mission to England.
After leaving these brethren we traveled 
by rail to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]], and walked from there 
to [[Canaan, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Canaan]], Connecticut, where we found 
a branch of the Church, including [[Jesse Moses|Jesse]] 
and [[Julian Moses|Julian Moses]] and Francis K. Bene-
dict.
We held a two-days' meeting with the 
Saints in Canaan, and I ordained Julian 
Moses and Francis K. Benedict elders.
After holding several meetings in the 
town of [[Colebrook, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Colebrook]], and visiting my 
half sister, [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice Woodruff]], who taught 
school there, I proceeded to [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], the 
place of my birth. There I visited 
many of my former neighbors and rela-
tives, and the grave of my mother, Beulah 
Woodruff, who died June 11th, 1808, 
when twenty-six years of age. The fol-
lowing verse was upon her tombstone:
A pleasing form, a generous heart, 
A good companion, just without art; 
Just in her dealings, faithful to her friend, 
Beloved through life, lamented in the end.
At the close of the day I walked six 
miles to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], where my father, 
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]], was living, and I had 
the happy privilege of once more meet-
ing with him and my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-mother]], whom 
I had not seen for seven years. They 
greeted me with great kindness, and it 
was a happy meeting.AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
surrounded by the mob, but the brethren 
had escaped through the mercy of God.
I was invited to hold a meeting at a 
Baptist meeting house on the 27th of 
June. On my arrival I met a large con-
gregation; but, on commencing meeting, 
[[Parson Browning|Parson Browning]] ordered the meeting to 
be closed. I told the people I had come 
ten miles to preach the gospel to them, 
and was willing to stand in a cart, on a 
pile of wood, on a fence, or any other 
place they would appoint, to have that 
privilege.
One man said he owned the fence and 
land in front of the meeting house, and 
we might use both, for he did not be-
lieve Mormonism would hurt either.
So the congregation crossed the road, 
took down the fence and made seats of 
it, and I preached to them one hour and 
a half. At the close Mr. Randolph 
Alexander bore testimony to the truth of 
what had been said. He invited me 
home with him, bought a Book of Mor-
mon, and was baptized, and I organized
a branch in that place.
On the 18th of July, Brother A. O. 
Smoot and I arrived at a ferry on the 
[[Tennessee River|Tennessee River]], and, as the ferryman 
was not at home, the woman kindly gave 
us permission to use the ferryboat. We 
led our horses on board, and took the 
oars to cross the river. Brother Smoot 
had never used an oar, and I had not for 
some years, so we made awkward work 
of it. Soon he broke one oar, and I let 
another fall overboard, which left us only 
one broken oar to get to shore with. 
We narrowly escaped running into a 
steamboat. We struck shore half a mile 
below the landing place, tied up the 
boat, jumped on the bank with our 
horses, and went on our way with blis-
tered hands, thankful to get off so well.
On Sunday, the 31st of July, A. O.
Smoot and I preached at Mr. David 
Crider's, [[Weakley County, Tennessee|Weakly County]], Tennessee. 
After the meeting Mr. Crider was bap-
tized. A mob gathered and threatened 
us, and poisoned our horses so that the 
one I rode, belonging to [[Samuel Walker West|Samuel West]], 
died a few days after. This horse had 
carried me thousands of miles while 
preaching the gospel.
I continued to travel with Brothers 
Smoot, [[David Wyman Patten|Patten]] and [[Warren Farr Parrish|Parrish]] in Tennessee 
and [[Kentucky|Kentucky]], and we baptized all who 
would receive our testimony.
[Column 2]
On the 2nd day of September we held 
a general conference at the Damon 
Creek Branch. Elder [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B. Marsh]], 
President of the Twelve Apostles, pre-
sided. All the branches in Tennessee 
and Kentucky were represented.
Brothers Randolph Alexander, Benja-
min L. Clapp and [[Johnston F. Lane|Johnson F. Lane]] were 
ordained elders and [[Lindsey Anderson Brady|Lindsay Bradey]] was 
ordained to the lesser priesthood.
I assisted President Marsh to obtain .
fifteen hundred dollars from the Southern 
brethren, to enter land in [[Missouri|Missouri]] for 
the Church. The brethren made me a 
present of fifty dollars, which I sent by 
President Marsh to enter forty acres of 
land for me. Elder Smoot and I were 
released from the Southern mission with 
permission to go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]].
Having returned from my Southern 
mission in the autumn of 1836, in com-
pany with Elders A. O. Smoot and Jesse 
Turpin, I spent the following winter in 
Kirtland. During this time I received 
my endowments and attended the school 
of Professsor [[H. M. Hawes|Haws]], who taught Greek, 
Latin and English grammar. I confined 
my studies mostly to Latin and English 
grammar.
This winter and the following spring, 
in some respects, may be regarded as 
one of the most interesting periods of 
the history of the Church, when we con-
sider the endowments and teachings 
given in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|temple]], and the great apos-
tasy which followed.
I was married to Miss Phoebe Whit-
more Carter, on the 13th of April, 1837, 
and received my patriarchal blessing 
under the hands of Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]], 
the Patriarch, two days later.
I felt impressed by the Spirit of God 
to take a mission to the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]], sit-
uated east of the Maine shore, a country 
I knew nothing about. I made my feel-
ings known to the Apostles, and they 
advised me to go.
Feeling that it was my duty to go upon 
this mission, I did not tarry at home one 
year after having married a wife, as the 
law of Moses would have allowed. On 
the contrary, I started just one month 
and one day after that important event, 
leaving my wife with Sister [[Olive Boynton Hale|Hale]], with 
whom she expected to stay for a season.
I left Kirtland in good spirits, in com-
pany with Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan H. Hale]], and 
walked twelve miles to [[Fairport Harbor, Lake County, Ohio|Fairport]], whereTULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
[[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|min L. Clapp]] priests. I also ordained 
one teacher and two deacons.
After conference I took Brothers 
[[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] and Clapp with me to preach. 
The former traveled with me constantly 
till the 21st of April, when we had the
privilege of meeting with Elder David 
W. Patten, who had come direct from 
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and who had been ordained 
one of the Twelve Apostles.
It was a happy meeting. He gave us 
an account of the endowments at Kirt-
land, the glorious blessings received, the 
ministration of angels, the organization 
of the Twelve Apostles and Seventies, 
and informed me that I was appointed 
a member of the second quorum of 
Seventies. All of this was glorious news 
to me, and caused my heart to rejoice.
On the 27th of May we were joined 
by Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]], direct from 
Kirtland. We had a happy time to-
gether.
On the 28th, we held a conference at 
Brother [[Seth Utley|Seth Utley's]], where were repre-
sented all the branches of the Church in 
the South.
I was ordained on the 31st of May a 
member of the second quorum of Seven-
ties under the hands of David W. Patten 
and Warren Parrish.
At the close of the conference we 
separated for a short time. Elders Pat-
ten and Parrish labored in [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], 
Brother Smoot and myself in [[Kentucky|Kentucky]]. 
On the 9th of June we all met at Damon 
Creek Branch, where Brother Patten 
baptized two. One was Father Henry 
Thomas, who had been a revolutionary
soldier under General Washington. and 
father of [[Daniel Thomas|Daniel]] and [[Henry Thomas|Henry Thomas]].
A warrant was issued, on the oath of 
a priest, against D. W. Patten, W. Par-
rish and myself. We were accused in 
the warrant of the great "crime" of 
testifying that Christ would come in this 
generation, and that we promised the 
Holy Ghost to those whom we baptized. 
Brothers Patten and Parrish were taken 
on the 19th of June. I, being in another 
county, escaped being arrested. The 
brethren were put under two thousand 
dollars bonds to appear at court. Albert 
Petty and Seth Utley were their bonds-
men.
They were tried on the 22nd of June. 
They pleaded their own cause. Although 
men came forward and testified they did
[Column 2]
receive the Holy Ghost after they were 
baptized, the brethren were condemned; 
but were finally released by paying the 
expenses of the mob court.
There was one peculiar circumstance 
connected with this trial by a mob court, 
which was armed to the teeth. When 
the trial was through with, the people 
were not willing to permit more than one 
to speak. Warren Parrish had said but 
few words, and they were not willing 
to let David Patten speak. But he, 
feeling the injustice of the court, and 
being filled with the power of God, 
arose to his feet and delivered a speech 
of about twenty minutes, holding them 
spell-bound while he told them of their 
wickedness and the abominations that 
they were guilty of, also of the curse of 
God that awaited them, if they did not 
repent, for taking up two harmless, in-
offensive men for preaching the gospel of 
Christ.
When he had got through his speech 
the judge said, "You must be armed 
with secret weapons, or you would not 
talk in this fearless manner to an armed 
court."
Brother Patten replied; "I have 
weapons that you know not of, and they 
are given me of God, for He gives me 
all the power I have."
The judge seemed willing to get rid of 
them almost upon any terms, and offered 
to dismiss them if their friends would 
pay the costs, which the brethren pres-
ent freely offered to do.
When the two were released, they 
mounted their horses and rode a mile to 
Seth Utley's; but, as soon as they had 
left, the court became ashamed that they 
had been let go so easily and the whole 
mob mounted their horses to follow them
to Utley's.
One of the Saints, seeing the state of 
affairs, went on before the mob to notify 
the brethren, so that they had time to 
ride into the woods near by.
They traveled along about three miles 
to Brother Albert Petty's, and went to 
bed. The night was dark, and they fell 
asleep.
But Brother Patten was warned in a 
dream to get up and flee, as the mob 
would soon be there. They both arose, 
saddled their animals, and rode into the 
adjoining county.
The house they had just left was soonAUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.

pointment at the house of Brother Tay-
lor, the step-father of Abraham O. 
Smoot.
I had to cross [[Blood River, Calloway County, Kentucky|Bloody River]], which I 
had to swim in, in consequence of heavy 
rains. While crossing, my horse became 
entangled in a tree-top, and almost 
drowned; but I succeeded in getting 
him loose.
We swam to the shore separately. He 
reached the shore first, and waited till I 
came out. I got into the saddle, and 
went on my way in good spirits, and had 
a good meeting.
On the 20th of October I baptized 
three Campbellites, one of whom was a 
deacon. I then rode twelve miles to Mr. 
[[Joseph Greenwood|Greenwood's]], who was eighty years old, 
and had been a soldier under General 
Washington. His [[Elizabeth Greenwood|wife]], who was ninety-
three years old, I found quite smart, and 
busy carding wool. I preached at their 
house and baptized both of them.
On the following day I preached at the 
house of [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin L. Clapp]], and bap-
tized seven Campbellites and one Bap-
tist.
On the 16th of November, I preached 
at Brother Camp's, and baptized three. 
On the day following, it being Sunday, 
I preached again at Brother Clapp's, and 
baptized five. At the close of the meet-
ing I mounted my horse to ride to 
[[Clarks River, Calloway County, Kentucky|Clark's River]], in company with Seth 
Utley, four other brethren and two sis-
ters. The distance was twenty miles.
We came to a stream, which was so 
swollen by rains, that we could not cross 
without swimming our horses. To swim 
would not be safe for the females, so we 
went up the stream to find a ford. In 
the attempt we were overtaken by a se-
vere storm of wind and rain, and lost 
our way in the darkness, and wandered 
through creeks and mud. But the Lord 
does not forsake his Saints in any of 
their troubles. While we were in the 
woods suffering under the blast of the 
storm, groping like the blind for the 
wall, a bright light suddenly shone 
around us, and revealed to us our dan-
gerous situation on the edge of a gulf. 
The light continued with us until we 
found the road; we then went on our 
way rejoicing, though the darkness re-
turned and the rain continued.
We reached Brother [[Henry Thomas|Henry Thomas']] 
in safety about nine o'clock at night,
[Column 2]
having been five hours in the storm and 
forded streams many times. None of us 
felt to complain, but were thankful to 
God for His preserving care.
On the following day I preached in 
[[Damon Creek, Calloway County, Kentucky|Damon Creek]], and organized a branch 
called the Damon Creek Branch, and 
ordained [[Daniel Thomas|Daniel Thomas]] a teacher.
On the 19th of December I again 
preached at the house of Brother Clapp, 
and baptized five persons; one was a 
Campbellite preacher.
On the following day I preached at 
the house of Brother Henry Thomas, 
when a mob of about fifty persons ccl-
lected, headed by a Baptist preacher, 
who, after asking one question, advised 
the mob not to lay hands on any man 
on account of his principles. The advice 
was good and well taken.
At the close of the meeting I baptized 
three persons, one seventy-eight years 
old.
This brings the year 1835 to a closeâ 
the first year of my missionâduring 
which time I had traveled three thousand 
two hundred and forty-eight miles, held 
one hundred and seventy meetings, bap-
tized forty-three personsâthree of whom 
were Campbellite preachersâassisted 
Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Parrish]] to baptize twenty more, 
confirmed thirty-five, organized three 
branches, ordained two teachers and one 
deacon, procured thirty subscribers for 
the Messenger and Advocate, one hun-
dred and seventy-three signers to the 
petition to the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|governor]] of [[Missouri|Missouri]] for 
redress of wrongs done the Saints in 
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], had three mobs rise 
against meâbut was not harmedâwrote 
eighteen letters, received ten, and, 
finally, closed the labors of the year 
1835, by eating johnny-cake, butter and 
honey, at brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot's]].
I spent the fore part of January, 1836, 
(the weather being very cold) at the 
house of A. O. Smoot, in Kentucky, 
studying Kirkham's English Grammar.
I continued to travel and preach in Ken-
tucky and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] and baptized all 
that would believe my testimony.
On the 26th of February we held a 
conference at the house of Brother Lewis 
Clapp (father of B. L. Clapp). There 
were represented one hundred and three 
members in that mission. I ordained 
A. O. Smoot and [[Benjamin Boydston|Benjamin Boyston]] 
elders, and Daniel Thomas and Benja-TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.

riages, clothed in broadcloth, and had 
large salaries, and would see this whole 
world sink to perdition before they 
would wade through one hundred and 
seventy miles of mud to save the people.
The [[Josiah Jackson|landlord]] wanted a little fun, so he 
said he would keep me if I would preach. 
He wanted to see if I could preach.
I must confess that by this time I be-
came a little mischievous, and pleaded
with him not to set me preaching.
The more I plead to be excused, the 
more determined Mr. Jackson was that I 
should preach. He took my valise, and 
the landlady got me a good supper.
I sat down in a large hall to eat sup-
per. Before I got through, the room 
began to be filled by some of the rich 
and fashionable of [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], dressed in 
their broadcloth and silk, while my 
appearance was such as you can imagine, 
after traveling through the mud as I had 
been.
When I had finished eating, the table 
was carried out of the room over the 
heads of the people. I was placed in the 
corner of the room, with a stand having 
a Bible, hymn book and candle on it, 
hemmed in by a dozen men, with the
landlord in the centre.
There were present some five hundred 
persons who had come together, not to 
hear a gospel sermon, but to have some 
fun.
I read a hymn, and asked them to 
sing. Not a soul would sing a word.
I told them I had not the gift of sing-
ing; but with the help of the Lord, I 
would both pray and preach. I knelt 
down to pray, and the men around me 
dropped on their knees. I prayed to 
the Lord to give me His Spirit and to 
show me the hearts of the people. I 
promised the Lord in my prayer I would 
deliver to that congregation whatever 
He would give to me. I arose and spoke 
one hour and a half and it was one of 
the best sermons of my life.
The lives of the congregation were 
open to the vision of my mind, and I 
told them of their wicked deeds and the 
reward they would obtain. The men 
who surrounded me dropped their heads. 
Three minutes after I closed I was the 
only person in the room.
Soon I was shown to a bed, in a room 
adjoining a large one in which were 
assembled many of the men whom I had
[Column 2]
been preaching to. I could hear their 
conversation.
One man said he would like to know 
how that Mormon boy knew of their 
past lives.
In a little while they got to disputing 
about some doctrinal point. One sug-
gested calling me to decide the point. 
The landlord said, "no; we have had 
enough for once.''
In the morning, I had a good break-
fast. The landlord said if I came that 
way again to stop at his house, and stay 
as long as I might choose.
After leaving Memphis, I traveled 
through the country to [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], 
and preached on the way as I had oppor-
tunity.
I stopped one night with a Squire 
Hardman, an Episcopalian.
Most of the night was spent by the 
family in music and dancing.
In the morning, at the breakfast table, 
Mr. Hardman asked me if we believed 
in music and dancing.
I told him we did not really consider 
them essential to salvation.
He said he did, and therefore should 
not join our Church.
On the 4th of April, 1835, I had the 
happy privilege of meeting Elder War-
ren Parrish at the house of Brother [[Joseph Fry|Frys]]. 
He had been preaching in that part of 
Tennessee, in company with David W. 
Patten, and had baptized a number and 
organized several small branches.
Brother Patten had returned home, 
and Brother Parrish was laboring alone. 
I joined him in the ministry, and we 
labored together three months and nine-
teen days, when he was called to Kirt-
land.
During the time we were together we 
traveled through several counties in Ten-
nessee for the distance of seven hundred 
and sixty miles, and preached the gospel 
daily, as we had opportunity. We bap-
tized some twenty persons.
By the counsel of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]], Elder Parrish 
ordained me an Elder, and left me to 
take charge of the branches that had 
been raised up in that neighborhood.
As soon as I was left alone I extended 
my circuit and labors. For a season I 
had large congregations; many seemed 
to believe and I baptized a number.
On the 15th of August I had an ap-AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.
[Column 1]
A mob was soon raised, and warning 
sent to us to leave immediately or we 
would be tarred and feathered, ridden 
on a rail and hanged. I soon saw where 
the serpents were. My [[Henry Brown|companion]] wanted 
to leave; I told him no, I would stay 
and see my dream fulfilled.
There was an old [[Jonathan Hubbel|gentleman]] and [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|lady]], 
named Hubbel, who had read the Book 
of Mormon and believed. Father Hub-
bel came to see us, and invited us to 
make our home with him while we stayed 
in the place. We did so, and labored 
for him some three weeks with our axes, 
clearing land, while we were waiting to 
see the salvation of God.
I was commanded of the Lord by the 
Holy Ghost to go and warn Mr. Ake-
man to repent of his wickedness. I did 
so, and each time he railed against me, 
and the last time he ordered me out of 
his house. When I went out he followed 
me and was very angry. When he came 
up to me, about eight rods from the 
house, he fell dead at my feet, turned 
black and swelled up, as I saw the ser-
pents do in my dream.
His family, as well as ourselves, felt it 
was the judgment of God upon him. I 
preached his funeral sermon. Many of 
the mob died suddenly. We stayed 
about two weeks after Akeman's death 
and preached, baptized Mr. Hubbel and 
his wife, and then continued on our 
journey.
We concluded to go down Arkansas 
River and cross into [[Tennessee|Tennessee]]. We 
could not get passage on the boat, be-
cause of the low water, so we went on 
the bank of the river and cut down a sound 
cottonwood tree, three feet through, and 
cut off a twelve-foot length from the 
butt end ; and in two days we dug out a 
canoe. We made a pair of oars and a 
rudder, and on the 11th of March, 1835, 
we launched our canoe, and commenced 
our voyage down the Arkansas River, 
without provisions.
The first day we sailed twenty-five 
miles, and stopped at night with a poor 
family who lived on the bank of the 
river. These kind folks gave us supper 
and breakfast, and, in the morning, gave 
us a johnny-cake and a piece of pork to 
take with us on our journey.
We traveled about fifty miles that day, 
and at night stopped at an old tavern, in 
a village called [[Cadron Settlement, Faulkner County, Arkansas Territory|Cadron]], which was de-
[Column 2]
serted because it was believed to be 
haunted by evil spirits.
We made a fire in the tavern, roasted 
a piece of our pork, ate our supper, said 
our prayers, went into a chamber, lay 
down on the bare floor, and were soon
asleep.
I dreamed I was at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house 
in a good feather bed, and I had a good 
night's rest. When I awoke the bed 
vanished, and I found myself on the bare 
floor and well rested, not having been 
troubled with evil spirits or anything 
else.
We thanked the Lord for His good-
ness to us, ate the remainder of our pro-
visions and continued our journey down 
the river to [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little Rock]], the capital of 
Arkansas, which then consisted of only 
a few cabins.
After visiting the place, we crossed 
the river and tied up our canoe, which 
had carried us safely one hundred and 
fifty miles.
We then took the old military road, 
leading from Little Rock to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], 
Tennessee. This road lay through 
swamps, and was covered with mud and 
water most of the way, for one hundred 
and seventy miles. We walked forty 
miles in a day through mud and water 
knee-deep.
On the 24th of March, after traveling 
some ten miles through mud, I was taken 
lame with a sharp pain in my knee, I 
sat down on a log.
My companion, who was anxious to 
get to his home in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], left me sit-
ting in an alligator swamp. I did not 
see him again for two years. I knelt 
down in the mud and prayed, and the 
Lord healed me, and I went on my way 
rejoicing.
On the 27th of March, I arrived at 
Memphis, weary and hungry. I went to 
the best tavern in the place, kept by Mr. 
[[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]]. I told him I was a 
stranger and had no money. I asked 
him if he would keep me over night.
He inquired of me what my business 
was.
I told him I was a preacher of the 
gospel.
He laughed and said that I did not 
look much like a preacher.
I did not blame him, as all the 
preachers he had ever been acquainted 
with rode on fine horses or in fine car-TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.

eat. That was the hardest day's work 
of my life.
The man's name was [[Mr. Williams|Williams]]. He 
was in the mob in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]: and 
after the Saints were driven out, he, with 
many others, went south.
We got up in the morning and walked 
in the rain twelve miles to the house of 
a man named [[Mr. Connor|Bemon]], who was also one 
of the mob from Jackson County. They 
were about sitting down to breakfast as 
we came in.
In those days it was the custom of the 
Missourians to ask you to eat even if 
they intended to cut your throat as soon 
as you got through; so he asked us to 
take breakfast, and we were very glad of 
the invitation.
He knew we were Mormons; and as 
soon as we began to eat he began to 
swear about the Mormons. He had a 
large platter of bacon and eggs, and 
plenty of bread on the table, and his 
swearing did not hinder our eating, for 
the harder he swore the harder we ate, 
until we got our stomachs full; then we 
arose from the table, took our hats, 
thanked him for our breakfast, and the 
last we heard of him he was still swear-
ing.
I trust the Lord will reward him for 
our breakfast.
In the early days of the Church, it 
was a great treat to an Elder in his travels 
through the country to find a Mormon; 
it was so with us. We were hardly in 
[[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] when we heard of a family 
named Akeman. They were in Jackson 
County in the persecutions. Some of 
the sons had been tied up there and 
whipped on their bare backs with hickory 
switches by the mob. We heard of their 
living on [[Petit Jean River, Arkansas Territory|Petit Jean River]], in the Ar-
kansas Territory, and we went a long 
way to visit them.
There had recently been heavy rains, 
and a creek that we had to cross was 
swollen to a rapid stream of eight rods 
in width. There was no person living 
nearer than two miles from the crossing, 
and no boat. The people living at the 
last house on the road, some three miles 
from the crossing, said we would have to 
tarry till the water fell before we could 
cross. We did not stop, feeling to trust 
in God.
Just as we arrived at the rolling flood 
a negro, on a powerful horse, entered
[Column 2]
the stream on the opposite side and rode 
through it. On our making our wants 
known to him, he took us, one at a time, 
behind him and carried us safely over, 
and we went on our way rejoicing.
We arrived that night within five 
miles of Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Akeman's]], and were kindly 
entertained by a stranger. During the 
night I had the following dream:
I thought an angel came to us, and 
told us we were commanded of the Lord 
to follow a certain straight path, which 
was pointed out to us, let it lead us 
wherever it might. After we had walked 
in it awhile we came to the door of a 
house, which was in the line of a high 
wall running north and south, so that we 
could not go around. I opened the door 
and saw the room was filled with large 
serpents, and I shuddered at the sight. 
My [[Henry Brown|companion]] said he would not go 
into the room for fear of the serpents. 
I told him I should try to go through the 
room though they killed me, for the 
Lord had commanded it. As I stepped 
into the room the serpents coiled them-
selves up, and raised their heads some 
two feet from the floor, to spring at me. 
There was one much larger than the rest 
in the centre of the room, which raised 
his head nearly as high as mine and 
made a spring at me. At that instant I 
felt as though nothing but the power of 
God could save me, and I stood still. 
Just before the serpent reached me he 
dropped dead at my feet; all the rest 
dropped dead, swelled up, turned black, 
burst open, took fire and were consumed 
before my eyes, and we went through 
the room unharmed, and thanked God 
for our deliverance.
I awoke in the morning and pondered 
upon the dream. We took breakfast, 
and started on our journey on Sunday 
morning, to visit Mr. Akeman. I re-
lated to my companion my dream, and 
told him we should see something strange. 
We had great anticipations of meeting 
Mr. Akeman, supposing him to be a 
member of the Church. When we ar-
rived at his house he received us very 
coldly, and we soon found that he had 
apostatized. He brought railing accusa-
tions against the Book of Mormon and 
the authorities of the Church.
Word was sent through all the settle-
ments on the river for twenty miles that 
two Mormon preachers were in the place.[Column 1]
give us a piece of bread, lied to us about 
the road, and sent us across the swamp, 
and we wallowed knee-deep in mud and 
water till ten o'clock at night in trying 
to follow this crooked [[Osage River, Missouri|river]]. We then 
left the swamp, and put out into the 
prairie, to lie in the grass for the night.
When we came out of the swamp, we 
heard an Indian drumming on a tin pail 
and singing. It was very dark, but we 
traveled towards the noise, and when we 
drew near the Indian camp quite a num-
ber of large Indian dogs came out to 
meet us. They smelt us, but did not 
bark nor bite.
We were soon surrounded by Osage 
Indians, and kindly received by Mr. 
[[Michael Geraud|Jereu]] and his wife, who was an Indian. 
She gave us an excellent supper and a 
good bed, which we were thankful for 
after the fatigue of the day.
As I laid my head upon my pillow, I 
felt to thank God from the bottom of 
my heart, for the exchange of the bar-
barous treatment of a civilized Presby-
terian priest for the humane, kind and 
generous treatment of the savage Osage 
Indians.
May God reward them both according 
to their deserts.
We arose in the morning, after a good 
night's rest. I was somewhat lame, 
from wading in the swamp the night 
before. We had a good breakfast. Mr. 
Jereu sent an Indian to see us across the 
river, and informed us that it was sixty 
miles to the nearest settlement of either 
white or red men.
We were too bashful to ask for any-
thing to take with us to eat; so we 
crossed the river and started on our 
day's journey of sixty miles without a 
morsel of food of any kind.
We started about sunrise and crossed 
a thirty-mile prairie, apparently as level 
as a house floor, without shrub or water. 
We arrived at timber about two o'clock 
in the afternoon. As we approached the 
timber a large black bear came out 
towards us. We were not afraid of him, 
for we were on the Lord's business, and 
had not mocked God's prophets as did 
the forty-two wicked children who said 
to Elisha "Go up thou bald head," for 
which they were torn by bears.
When the bear got within eight rods 
of us he sat on his haunches and looked 
at us a moment, and then ran away;
[Column 2]
and we went on our way rejoicing. We 
had to travel in the night, which was 
cloudy and very dark, so we had great 
difficulty to keep the road. Soon a large 
drove of wolves gathered around, and 
followed us. They came very close, and 
at times it seemed as though they would 
eat us up.
We had materials for striking a light, 
and at ten o'clock, not knowing where 
we were, and the wolves becoming so 
bold, we thought it wisdom to make a 
fire; so we stopped and gathered a lot 
of oak limbs that lay on the ground, and 
lit them, and as our fire began to burn 
the wolves left us.
As we were about to lay down on the 
groundâfor we had no blanketsâwe 
heard a dog bark.
My companion said it was a wolf; I 
said it was a dog: but soon we heard a 
cow bell. Then we each took a fire-
brand and went about a quarter of a 
mile, and found the house, which was 
sixty miles from where we started that 
morning.
It was an old log cabin, about twelve 
feet square, with no door, but an old 
blanket was hung up in the door-way. 
There was no furniture except one bed-
stead, upon which lay a woman, several 
children and several small dogs. A [[Mr. Williams|man]] 
lay on the bare floor with his feet to the 
fire-place, and all were asleep. I went 
in and spoke to the man, but did not 
wake him. I stepped to him, and laid 
my hand on his shoulder. The moment 
he felt the weight of my hand he jumped 
to his feet, and ran around the room as 
though he was frightened; but he was 
quieted when we informed him we were 
friends.
The cause of his fright was, he had 
shot a panther a few nights before, and 
he thought its mate had jumped upon 
him.
He asked us what we wanted; we told 
him we wished to stop with him all 
night, and would like something to eat. 
He informed us we might lay on the 
floor as he did, but that he had not a 
mouthful for us to eat, as he had to de-
pend on his gun to get breakfast for his 
family in the morning. So we lay on 
the bare floor, and slept through a long, 
rainy night, which was pretty hard after 
walking sixty miles without anything to TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
[Column 1]
Zion's Camp to [[Missouri|Missouri]], and we had 
passed through all the trials of that jour-
ney, and had buried a number of our 
brethren, as recorded in history, the 
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] called the Camp together, and 
organized the Church in Zion, and gave 
much good counsel to all.
He advised all the young men, who 
had no families, to stay in Missouri, and 
not return to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. Not having any 
family, I stopped with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], as 
did [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]]. 
We spent the summer together, laboring 
hard, cutting wheat, quarrying rock, 
making brick, or anything else we could 
find to do.
In the Fall I had a desire to go and 
preach the gospel. I knew the gospel 
which the Lord had revealed to Joseph 
Smith was true, and of such great value 
that I wanted to tell it to the people 
who had not heard it. It was so good 
and plain, it seemed to me I could make 
the people believe it.
I was but a Teacher, and it is not a 
Teacher's office to go abroad and preach. 
I dared not tell any of the authorities of 
the Church that I wanted to preach, lest 
they might think I was seeking for an 
office.
I went to the woods where no one 
could see me, and I prayed to the Lord 
to open my way so that I could go and 
preach the gospel. While I was praying, 
the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, 
and told me my prayer was heard and 
that my request should be granted.
I felt very happy, and got up and 
walked out of the woods into the trav-
eled road, and there I met a high priest 
who had lived in the same house with me 
some six months.
He had not said a word to me about 
preaching the gospel; but now, as soon 
as I had met him, he said, "the Lord 
has revealed to me that it is your privi-
lege to be ordained, and to go and 
preach the gospel."
I told him I was willing to do what-
ever the Lord required of me. I did 
tell him I had just asked the Lord to let 
me go and preach.
In a few days a council was called at 
Lyman Wight's, and I was ordained a 
Priest and sent on a mission into Ar-
kansas and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in company with 
an [[Henry Brown|elder]]. This mission was given us by
[Column 2]
Elder [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]], who was the 
first Bishop ordained in the Church.
The law of God to us in those days 
was to go without purse or scrip. Our 
journey lay through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], 
from which the Saints had just been 
driven, and it was dangerous for a Mor-
mon to be found in that part of the 
State.
We put some Books of Mormon and 
some clothing into our valises, strapped 
them on our backs, and started on foot. 
We crossed the ferry into Jackson 
County, and went through it.
In some instances the Lord preserved 
us, as it were by miracle, from the mob.
We dare not go to houses and get 
food, so we picked and ate raw corn, 
and slept on the ground, and did any 
way we could until we got out of the 
county.
We dared not preach while in that 
county, and we did but little preaching 
in the State of Missouri. The first time 
I attempted to preach was on Sunday, in 
a tavern, in the early part of December, 
1834. It was snowing at the time and 
the room was full of people. As I com-
menced to speak the landlord opened 
the door, and the snow blew on the peo-
ple; and when I inquired the object of 
having the door opened in a snow storm, 
he informed me that he wanted some 
light on the subject. I found that it was 
the custom of the country.
How much good I did in that sermon 
I never knew, and probably never shall 
know until I meet that congregation in 
judgment.
In the southern part of Missouri and 
the northern part of Arkansas, in 1834, 
there were but very few inhabitants.
We visited a place called Harmony 
Mission, on the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage River]], one of the 
most crooked rivers in the west. This 
mission was kept by a Presbyterian min-
ister and his family.
We arrived there on Sunday night at 
sunset. We had walked all day with 
nothing to eat, and were very hungry 
and tired. Neither the minister nor his 
wife would give us anything to eat, nor 
let us stay over night, because we were 
Mormons, and the only chance we had 
was to go twelve miles further down the 
river, to an Osage Indian trading post, 
kept by a Frenchman named [[Michael Geraud|Jereu]]. 
And this wicked priest, who would notAUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.

April 11th, 1834âWith my horses 
and wagon I took Brothers [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]] 
and [[Warren Ingles|Warren Ingles]] and started for Zion. 
I met with [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[John M. Murdock|John Murdoch]] 
and other elders on the way, and ar-
rived in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] on the 25th day of 
April, 1834.
The Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] invited me to 
make his house my home; I accepted his 
offer, and staid with him about one week. 
I became acquainted with many of the 
high priests, elders and Saints. I spent 
one Sabbath in Kirtland and heard many 
of the elders speak, and I felt to rejoice 
before God for the light and knowledge 
which was manifested to me during that 
day.
The first day of May, 1834, was ap-
pointed for the Camp of Zion to start 
from Kirtland to go up to [[Missouri|Missouri]] for 
the redemption of their brethren. Only 
a small portion of the Camp was ready. 
The Prophet told those who were ready, 
to go to [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]] and wait for the 
remainder. I left, in company with about 
twenty men, with the baggage wagons. 
At night we pitched our tents. I went to 
the top of the hill and looked down upon 
the Camp of Israel. I knelt upon the 
ground and prayed. I rejoiced and 
praised the Lord that I had lived to see 
some of the tents of Israel pitched, and 
a company gathered by the command-
ment of God to go up and help redeem 
Zion.
We tarried at New Portage until the 
6th, when we were joined by the Prophet
and eighty-five more men. The day be-
fore they arrived, while passing through 
the village of [[Middlebury, Van Wert County, Ohio|Middlebury]], the people 
tried to count them; but the Lord multi-
plied them in the eyes of the people; so
that those who numbered them said there
were four hundred of them.
On the 7th, Brother Joseph organized 
the camp, which consisted of about one 
hundred and thirty men. On the follow-
ing day we continued our journey. We 
pitched our tents at night and had prayers 
night and morning. The Prophet told 
us every day what we should do.
We were nearly all young men, gath-
ered from all parts of the country, and 
strangers to each other; but we got ac-
quainted very soon, and had a happy 
time together.
It was a great school for us to be led 
by a Prophet of God a thousand miles,
[Column 2]
through cities, towns, villages, and 
through the wilderness.
When persons stood by to count us 
they could not tell how many we num-
bered; some said five hundred, others 
one thousand.
Many were astonished as we passed 
through their towns. One lady ran to 
her door, pushed her spectacles to the 
top of her head, raised her hands, and 
exclaimed: "What under heavens has 
broken loose?" She stood in that posi-
tion the last I saw of her.
The published history of Zion's Camp 
gives an account of the bones of a man 
we dug out of a mound. His name was 
Zelph. The Lord showed the Prophet 
the history of the man in a vision. The 
arrow by which he was killed was found 
among his bones. One of his thigh 
bones was broken by a stone slung in 
battle. The bone was put into my 
wagon, and I carried it to [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], 
Missouri, and buried it in the earth.
The Lord delivered Israel in the days 
of Moses by dividing the Red Sea, so 
they went over dry shod. When their 
enemies tried to do the same, the water 
closed upon them and they were drowned. 
The Lord delivered Zion's Camp from 
their enemies on the 19th of June, 1834, 
by piling up the waters in [[Fishing River, Clay County, Missouri|Fishing River]] 
forty feet in one night, so our enemies 
could not cross. He also sent a great 
hail-storm, which broke them up and 
sent them seeking for shelter.
The Camp of Zion arrived at Brother 
[[John Matthias Burk|Burk's]], in Clay County, Missouri, on 
the 24th of June, 1834, and we pitched 
our tents on the premises. He told some 
of the brethren of my company that he 
had a spare room that some of us might 
occupy if we would clean it. Our com-
pany accepted the offer, and, fearing 
that some other company would get it 
first, left all other business and went to 
work, cleaning out the room, and imme-
diately spread down our blankets, so as 
to hold a right to the room. It was but 
a short time afterwards that our brethren, 
who were attacked by cholera, were 
brought in and laid upon our beds. 
None of us ever used those blankets 
again, for they were buried with the 
dead. So we gained nothing but experi-
ence by being selfish, and we lost our 
bedding.

ing the [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Mills, until I was 
twenty years of age.
In April, 1827, I took the flouring mill 
of my aunt, [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen Wheeler]], which I at-
tended three years. In May, 1830, I took 
charge of the flouring mill of Mr. Col-
lins, the ax manufacturer, in South Can-
ton, Connecticut. At the end of one 
year it was demolished to make way for 
other machinery. In March, 1831, I 
took charge of the flouring mill owned 
by Mr. [[Richard B. Cowles|Richard B. Cowles]], of New Hart-
ford, Connecticut. In the spring of 1832, 
in company with my oldest brother, 
[[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], I went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego 
County, New York, and purchased a farm 
and saw mill, and settled in business.
At an early age my mind was exercised 
upon religious subjects, although I never 
made a profession until 1830. I did not 
then join any church, for the reason that 
I could not find any denomination whose 
doctrines, faith or practice, agreed with 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordin-
ances and gifts which the Apostles taught. 
Although the ministers of the day taught 
that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles and 
ordinances, which the ancient saints en-
joyed, were done away and no longer 
needed, I did not believe it to be true, 
only as they were done away through the 
unbelief of the children of men. I be-
lieved the same gifts, graces, miracles 
and power would be manifest in one age 
of the world as in another, when God 
had a church upon the earth, and that 
the church of God would be re-estab-
lished upon the earth, and that I should 
live to see it. These principles were riv-
eted upon my mind from the perusal of 
the Old and New Testament, with fervent 
prayer that the Lord would show me what 
was right and wrong, and lead me in the 
path of salvation, without any regard to 
the opinions of man: and the whisperings 
of the Spirit of the Lord for the space of 
three years, taught me that he was about 
to set up his church and kingdom upon the 
earth in the last days. I was taught these 
things from my youth by [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], 
an aged man, who lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]], Con-
necticut, who was frequently called the 
old prophet Mason; he taught me many 
things which are now coming to pass. 
He did not believe that any man had 
authority to administer in the ordinances 
of the gospel, but believed it was our 
privilege through faith, prayer and fast-
[Column 2]
ing, to heal the sick, and cast out devils 
by the laying on of hands, which was the 
case under his administration, as many 
could testify.
In 1832, I was inspired to go to 
[[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]; my brother, [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]], was 
also directed by the Spirit of God to go 
to the same place. When we met, we 
both told our impressions, and it caused 
us to marvel and wonder, what the Lord 
wanted of us in Rhode Island; but as we 
had made preparations to move to the 
west, we let outward circumstances con-
trol us, and Jonah-like, instead of going 
to Rhode Island, we went to Richland, 
Oswego County, New York, and there 
remained until December 29th, 1833, 
when I heard Elders [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] and 
[[Elijah Cheney|Elijah Cheeny]] preach. My brother Az-
mon and I believed their testimony, en-
tertained the elders, and offered ourselves 
for baptism the first sermon we heard. 
We read the Book of Mormon, and I re-
ceived a testimony that it was true.
We soon learned what the Lord wanted 
of us in Rhode Island, for at the time we 
were warned to go there, two of the 
elders were preaching there, and had we 
gone, we should have embraced the work 
at that time.
December 31stâI was baptized by 
Elder Zerah Pulsipher; he confirmed me 
the same evening.
January 2nd, 1834âI was ordained a 
teacher, and my brother Azmon, an 
elder, and a small branch was organized 
of 12 members by Elder Pulsipher.
In February following, in company 
with Elder Holton, I walked some 60 
miles to the town of [[Fabius, Onondaga County, New York|Fabius]], to attend an 
evening meeting of the Saints in that 
place, where Elder Pulsipher was presid-
ing; I saw the book of commandments 
or revelations given through [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], 
and I believed them with all my heart and 
rejoiced therein; and after spending sev-
eral days, and holding several meetings, 
we returned home rejoicing.
During the winter, we were visited by 
several of the elders. February 1st, Elder 
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] called upon us and in-
structed the branch till midnight; we 
had a precious time. I accompanied 
brother Pratt to [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]], and 
told him my circumstances; he said 
it was my duty to prepare myself to go 
to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and join the Camp of Zion. 
I immediately settled my business.TULLIDGE'S

[Column 1]
CHAPTER I.
FAMILY SKETCH. MY EARLY DAYS AND 
MINISTRY.
In tracing the history of my fathers, I 
find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory 
account of the Woodruff family for more 
than three generations.
My great grandfather, [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Woodruff]], 
lived nearly one hundred years, and pos-
sessed an iron constitution, and per-
formed a great amount of manual labor 
nearly up to the time of his death. His 
wife's name was [[Sarah Woodford Woodruff|Sarah]]; she bore to him 
nine children as follows:â[[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1743|Josiah]], Apple-
ton, [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad]], [[Elisha Woodruff|Elisha]], [[Joseph Woodruff, b. 1752|Joseph]], [[Rhoda Rosetta Woodruff Gridley|Rhoda]], [[Phoebe Woodruff, b. 1738|Phebe]], 
and two names not given.
My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was 
the third son of Josiah. He was born in 
[[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Hartford County, Connecti-
cut, in 1751; he also possessed a strong 
constitution; it was said that he per-
formed the most labor for several years 
of any man in Hartford County, and 
from over exertion in hewing timber he 
was attacked with rheumatism in his right 
hip, which caused severe lameness, for 
several years before his death. He mar-
ried [[Dinah Woodford Woodruff|Dinah Woodford]], by whom he had 
seven children, viz:â[[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1773|Eldad]], [[Elizabeth Woodruff Frisbie|Elizabeth]], 
[[Samuel Gridley Woodruff|Samuel]], [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek]], [[Titus Woodruff|Titus]], [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen]], and [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]].
Eldad married [[Lewey Woodford Woodruff|Lewey Woodford]]; Eliz-
abeth, [[Amasa Frisbie|Amasa Frisby]]; Samuel, Miss [[Nancy Case Woodruff|Case]]; 
Aphek, [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Beulah Thompson]] and Azubah 
Hart; Titus, [[Louisa Alling Woodruff|Louisa Allen]]; Hellen, Amos 
Wheeler; and Ozem, [[Acksah Merrill Woodruff|Acksah Merrill]] and 
[[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah Hart]]; all of whom had large 
families.
My grandfather died in Farmington, 
with the spotted fever in 1806, aged 55 
years. My grandmother, Dinah, died in 
1824, in the same place, with a cancer in 
the left breast; her sufferings were very 
great.
My father, Aphek Woodruff, was born
[Column 2]
in Farmington, November 11th, 1778; he 
married Beulah Thompson (who was born 
in 1782) November 29th, 1801. She bore 
three sons, namely:â[[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], born No-
vember 29th, 1802; [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Ozen Thompson]], 
born December 22nd, 1804; myself, born 
March 1st, 1807.
My mother died with the spotted fever, 
June 11th, 1808, aged 26 years, leaving 
me fifteen months old. My father's second 
wife, Azubah Hart, was born July 31st, 
1792; they were married November 9th, 
1810; they had six children, viz: [[Philo Woodruff|Philo]], 
born November 29th, 1811, and died by 
poison administered by a physician No-
vember 25th, 1827; [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel Hart]], born 
April 11th, 1814, and died in [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terrahaute]], 
October 18th, 1838; [[Franklin Woodruff|Franklin]], born 
March 12th, 1816, and died June 1st; 
[[Newton Woodruff, b. 1818|Newton]], born June 19th, 1818, drowned 
September, 1820; [[Julius Woodruff|Julius]], born April 22nd, 
1820, and died in infancy; [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]], born 
June 19th, 1821. I married her to Dwight 
Webster in Farmington, Connecticut 
August 4th, 1841.
My father was a strong constitutioned 
man, and has done a great amount of 
labor. At eighteen years of age, he com-
menced attending a flouring and saw mill, 
and continued about 50 years; most of 
this time he labored eighteen hours a day.
He never made any profession of re-
ligion, until I baptized him with all his 
household into the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints on the first day of 
July, 1838. He was a man of great charity, 
honesty, integrity and truth, and made 
himself poor by giving to the poor, and 
accommodating his fellow men by loan-
ing money and becoming surety for his 
neighbors, and always saying yes, to every 
man who asked a favor at his hand.
I was born in the north part of the 
town of Farmington, now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], 
Hartford County, Connecticut, March 
1st, 1807. I assisted my father in attend-[Image and signature of Wilford Woodruff][page upside down]

Concerning myself I will say I was

was ^passed^ under the influence of the remnants of the

which I took a very severe
cold which settled into bilious
fever.

At the April Conference
there were 275 ordained to
the office ^under the hands^ of Elders, Brigham
Young, [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]],
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]],
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]], George A

offi While these ordinations were
going on Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] was
in the stand delivering a
discourse to the multitude,
while others of the Elders were
baptizing and confirming
at the font and elsewhere.Just before the April Conference
the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] administered the
ordinance of rebaptism to the
Church, baptizing many himself,
among whom were the Twelve,
who afterwards assisted him
in baptizing and confirming
the multitude. This was the
first time I was rebaptized. At
since my [ent] the Prophet
Joseph administered
the close of the administration
the Prophet lifted up his hands
to heaven and blessed the 
people and the Spirit ofbaptism for the dead, both of
which occurred on Sunday Nov 21st,
1841. A large congregation
assembled and Elders Brigham
Young, [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]] and
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] baptized about forty
and persons and Elders Willard
Richards, [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] and
Wilford Woodruff confirmed them.
During the following week
a company of about 200 Saints
arrived from [[England|England]], and I was
now again in the midst of
hundreds whom I had baptized
in America, the "Islands of the Sea"
and England and [[Wales|Wales]].Autobiography of Wilford Woodruff
The remaining months of
the year 1841 was spent by the
Twelve, after their return from
this successful mission in G
to [[Great Britain|Great Britain]], in settling
their families in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] and
taking charge of the affairs of
the affairs Church. Several
noteworthy events took place at this
time among which were the
dedication of the baptismal font
in the Temple by the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] and
the Twelve and the first adminis-
trations of the ordinance ofto peaces & the glass flew among the Congregation
And the man who had tended the gass in the [[Carpenter's Hall, Manchester, Lancashire, England|Hall]] said
for twenty years said he had never known
any [wei[r]der] of the kind. the chimneys were replaced
& the discussions went on I set by the side of Doctor
[[Willard Richards|W Richards]], and at the commencement of the meeting
a very interesting old gentleman appeared in the congrega
-tion he sat at the end of a seat joing the ally near
the platform, He made me think of what he s is said of
the Ancient of Days his hair was white as wool & rested
in a large white roll upon his shoulders, he was a noble
looking man he eyed us with great interest &
penetration, he occupied his seat to our view then
some half an hour I called the attention of Doctor
Richards to him we both looked at him with feelings
of both interest, some little disturbance in another part
of the Home attracted our attention & when we
returned our eyes to the seat of our interesting visitor
we found his seat vacant, & he had disappeared
there for the first time we felt that we had been
visited by John the Revelator or one of the three
Ancient Nephite, however the discussion went on
Mr Barrytt was confounded, & Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] greived
the victory, & quite a number of the methodist who 
attended that discussion, was baptized & joined the Latter
Day Saintsdifficulty the same power of the Destroyer had been
seeking [[George Albert Smith|his]] life as well as my own, and he was
delivered in the same way. the three personages that
appeared unto me one was a tall man I shoude think
over sisx feet the other m[i]dd[l]e one was another man was
medium size & the 3rd was a short man they we[r]e all clothed
alike Neither of them spoke a word to my hearing but
as soon as they laid hands upon my head & I was
delivered they disappeared, I felt thankful to God for
the presirvation of my life. (Brother [[Edward William Tullidge|Tullage]] record this
in one of the blank pages & refer to the page)
Oct 7th 1840. In company with the Twelve and many
other Saints I attended a discussion in the evening held
at the [[Carpenter's Hall, Manchester, Lancashire, England|Carpenters Hall]], Garrett Road, Manchester. One Mr
[[Mr. Barrett|Barrett]] had tried hard for a length of time to get
some of the Twelve to hold a discussion with him, though
his continued teazing preached [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] told him
the Twelve would not stoop to discuss any subject with
him but if he must discuss the subject of Mormonism
he would appo[in]t some body to meet him, as Mr Barrytt
would not take no for an answer Brother [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]]
was appo[in]ted to meet him Brother Cordon as it were was
a beardless boy yet he had been ordained an Elder &
received much of the Spirit of the Lord and they met
for this purpose at early candle light, the Stand was
occupied on one side by my Methodist Priest, & on the
other side by the Twelve Apostles & Elders. The Home was lyted
by 3 chandeliers with 12 lights in each lighthed with
gass there were some 1500 people present. Mr Barrett pledged him-
self to prove th Book of Mormon false & water baptism
^not^ essential to Salvation while Brother Cordon pleged
himself to prove the Book of Mormon true & water
baptism essential to Salvation.  As Mr Barrytt arose
& declyaired to the Assembly that he would prove the Book of
Mormon false & water baptism not essential to
Salvation 4 glass chimneys in each of the chanderliers burst[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] Oct 18, 1840, Sunday [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] & myself met at
Father [[Henry C. Corner|Cornors]] & held three meetings through the day and evening
we red in the book of Mormon, broke bread to the
Saints. I felt the Spirit of God bare testimony to
me that there would be a great work in London
We retired to rest in good season. I felt well in
my mind and slept untill about 12 oclok at night
I awoke and meditated upon the things of God untill
about 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a determina-
tion to warn the Inhabitants of London, & overcome
the powers of darkness which were besetting us day by
day and trying to overcome us. As I was forming
this determination in my own mind a personage appeared
unto me which I considered was the prince of darkess
darkness or the Devil, he made war with me and attempted
to take my life he laid hold of me like a strong
armed man, I felt like the wait of a heavy man
lying upon my body and he caught me by the throat
with a strong grip and choaked me nearly to death
I struggled with him as one man would struggled
with another I, felt as though this destroyer would overcom
me & that I must die as I saw no way that I could
escape his grasp, at that instant the thought came to me
why do you not pray, & call upon the Lord for help, I then
asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to deliver
me from the power of the Devil & preserve my life
instantly three personages came throught the door dressed
in white with considerable light surrounding them they
came up to the bed side while I was lying in the grasp
of the Enemy & they laid their hands upon my head & in
the twinkling of an eye I was liberated & the spirit of God
vibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the souls
of my feet and I was instantly covered all over in a high
state of persperation water stood upon ^me^ in drops. As soon
as I could speak I spoke to Brother G. A. Smith &
I found that he had been labering under the sameto the ferry to return to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], a Gentile
came to him & asked him if he would not
go out into the country some two miles & heal
a pair of Twinn Children about 3 months old both
of which were vary sick. He said I cannot go but
I will send a man, who will do just as well. He
Turned The [[Joseph Smith Jr.|prophet]] turned to me & said you go
with this man & teach him & his houshold the principles
of faith in Christ then lay your hands upon
the Children & heal them in the name of the Lord
At the same time handing me a silk bandanna
red hankerchief & said wipe their face with that
Handkerchief & they shall get well ^and as long as you will keep^ then the prophet returned
^this Handkerchiaf it shall ever remain as a league between you & me^ home & I went & done as I was comma[nded] & the
Children were healed. The deeds of this day showed me more
of the power of God in healing of the sick than I ever
before saw in the Church & kingdom of God in any day
of my life. I still keep the Handkerchief in memory of
the prophet Joseph
[rest of page blank]On the 22nd day of July 1839, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the prophet having been
sick for several days, & his home & door yard containg many
of the sick saints who had been driven from [[Missouri|Missouri]]. Joseph
rose from his bed with the power of God resting upon him
and he took the sick by the hand & in a loud voice
commanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ to
arise & be made whole & he healed all that were
in his house & around about he then took some
of the Twelve with him & walked up the [[Mississippi River, United States|River]] bank
about a mile & healing all that were sick as he went
along & they were many among the number was Elder
[[Henry Garlick Sherwood|Sherwood]] who lay at the point of death. He crossed
the River to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa|Montrose]] went into the home where Brigham
Young lay sick & healed him, who walked out of the
home & followed him. The prophet came to where I was 
standing & told me to follow him I did so we
then went into the home of [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]] who
was at the point of death, his friends had looked
for him to breath his last for several hours, he
had lost his speech & nearly his breath. we walked
into the room Brother The Joseph took brother
Fordham by the hand & looking the dying man in
the eyes for several moments. He then said Brother Fordham
in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I comand
you to arise & be made whole. The voice of the prophet
was like the voice of God it seemed as though the whole
home shook from its very foundation. And the man
leaped from his bed & was made whole instaneously
He kicked his poltices off from his feet, dressed himself
eat a boll of bread & milk & followed us out of the house
I went into the House of [[Joseph Bates Noble|Bates Nobles]] who was also
very sick the prophet healed him & we knelt down & prayed
& gave thanks to God. The wicked became alarmed at the seeing
the power of God and followed to see what the end would
be. After the prophet had healed, all the sick saints in
Montrose he with several of the Twelve & [[Sidney Rigdon|S. Rigdon]] went[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] presided at a Conference held at 
[[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] Ill on the 6th May 1839 where it was resolved 
that 15 of the Seventies Names given also 5 High priest accompany
the Twelve to [[Europe|Europe]] only two out of the Twenty fulfilled 
the mission. May 9th Joseph Smith left Quincy with his family 
for [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] Ill. on the 9 May and arrived on the 10th & 
sleped with his family in a log home nearly all of the Church
who were driven from [[Missouri|Missouri]] soon followed the 
prophet to Commerce, Ill. On the 9 11 June Joseph 
Smith commenced dictating his History to his Clerks, who 
wrote for him. On the 15 May 1839 I left Quincy Ill. and 
started with my family for Commerce Ill I ownly drove
to the Committee House & spent the night. 16th Brother Brigham 
Young & myself started with our families & drove 15 miles 
& camped for the night, and on the night of the 17th, we
camped on the bottom of an open prairie. We arrrived in
Commerce on the 18th, and called upon Brother Joseph 
Smith & his family. I also say many other old friends 
who had been driven from place to place yet 
th[e]y felt well, & were not discouraged but felt to 
trust in God. The Saints felt determined to ^try to^ build
up a City wherever they went, Commerce was beautiful
for situations yet there was but two or three buildings
in the town. After spending a short time visiting old 
acquaintances I crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi River]] in a 
ferry boat and landed in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] Iowa. This 
was the first time I ever was in the Terr[i]tory.
Montrose was built for a garrison in 1834 by the
United States Army. It contained about  12 blocks of
buildings making about 75 rooms in all. After spending
the night in Doctor [[Isaac Galland|Gallands]] office, I moved my family 
and effects into a room on the west side of the public
square. This room I occupied untill I started upon 
my mission for [[England|England]] and my family occupied it
after my departureand done much good in Zion, but for 
all these things we should ever acknowledge
the Hand of God therein and give him the 
honor praise & glory forever & ever Amen[[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]] Elders [[Brigham Young|B. Young]], [[Willard Richards|W Richards]] & W Woodruff 
laid hands upon [[Mary Pitt|her]] head & confirmed her, Br
Young being mouth and rebuked her lameness
& commanded her to rise & walk in the Name of 
the Lord and she was made whole and never 
used a staff or cruch to the day of her death 
she walked through the town of Dymock next 
day which created a stir among the people 
but the wicked did not feel to give God the 
glory. The whole History of this [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] Mission 
shows us the importance of carefully ^listening^ listeninig to 
the still small voice of the spirit of God, to listen 
^to^ the revelations of the Holy Ghost. The Lord had a 
people there prepared for the Gospel, they were praying 
for light & truth, the Lord sent me to them 
I declared the Gospel of Life and Salvation unto 
them, and some eighteen hundred souls received it 
and many of them have been gathered to Zion in these
Mountains and many of them have been called to 
officiate in the Bishoppric Bishoprickssome two hundred preachers of the various denominations 
This field of labor embraced [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] 
[[Gloucestershire, England|Glostershire]] & [[Worcestershire, England|Worstershire]] and formed these Conferences 
Garway ^[[Garway, Herefordshire, England|Garway]]^, [[Gadfield Elm, Worcestershire, England|Gadfield Elm]] & [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frooms Hill]], I was visited 
by president ^[[Brigham Young|young]]^ & Dr [[Willard Richards|Richards]], Brother [[John Benbow|Benbow]] furnished  
us with Â£300, to print the first Book of Mormon 
that we published in [[England|England]] and on the 20 day of May 
1840 B Young, W Woodruff & W Richards held a council 
on the top of Malv [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]], and there decided
that president Young go dirct ^direct^ to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] & publish 
3000 copies of the Hymn Book, & 3000 copies 
of the Book of Mormon this being the first of the 
publishing of these Books in England. The power of God 
rested upon us upon this Mission, the sick were 
healed, Devils were cast out, the lame was made 
to walk one notible case I will mention Mary
Pitt who died in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] sister to [[William Hill Pitt|Wm Pitt]] who 
died in [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake City]] she had not walked upon 
her feet for eleven years we carr[i]ed her unto 
the water where I baptized her. On the evening of 
the 18 May 1840 at Br [[Thomas Kington|Kingtons]] house in [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]][page covered] [fr]om preaching in the British dominions in this 
[p]etition the rector stated that one Mormon
American Missionary [had] baptized fifteen hundred 
mostly members of the English Church during the last 
seven months, but the Lord Bishop & Council understanding 
very well, that the laws of [[England|England]] gave free toleration 
to all religions under the British flag sent word 
to the petitioners that if they [loved] the worth of souls 
at least as much as they did the ground where 
hares foxes & hounds run they would not loose 
as many of their flock. I continued to preach and 
baptize daily. On the 21st day of March I baptized Elder 
[[Thomas Kington|Thomas Kington]]. He was the superintendant of both 
preachers & members of the United Brethren, the first 
thirty days after my arrival in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] I had baptized 
forty five preachers, & 160 members of the United Brethren
which put into my hands one Chapel & 45 homes 
licensed according to law to preach in, this opened a 
wide field for labor, this enabled me to bring into 
the Church through the blessings of God over eighteen hundred 
souls during eight month labor including all of the 
600 united Brethren exept one persons it also includedbaptism seven offered themselves, 4four were preachers, among 
the number ^offered^ offered for baptism was the constable. He arose &
said Mr Woodruff I would like to be baptized, I told 
him I would like to to baptize him, I went down 
to the pool & baptized the seven we then met together 
and I confirmed thirteen, & broak bread unto the 
Saints and we all rejoiced together. The constable went
to the rector and told him that if he wanted Mr 
Woodruff taken up for preaching the Gospel he must go 
himself and serve the writ, for he had ^heard^ her him 
preach the ownly true gospel sermon he had ever 
heard in his life. The rector did not know what 
to make of it, and he sent two clerks of the 
Church of England ads ^as^ spies to attend our meeting 
to see what we did preach but they were both 
pricked in their hearts, and received the word of God 
gladly & were baptized and confirmed members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the 
rector became alarmed & dare not send any body 
^els^ but the Ministers & rectors of the Church of England
of the South of England called a convention and sent 
a petition to the Lord Bishop of [[Canterbury, Kent, England|Canterbury]] to petition
parliment to pass a Law to prohibit the Mormonsthere. ^I afterwards baptized 600 in this pool of water^ On Sunday the 8, I preached at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frooms Hill]]
in the morning, at [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standly Hill]] in the afternoon
and at [[John Benbow|John Benbows]] [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill farm]] in the evening. It was
a remarkable incident that the parrish Church that
stood in the Neiborhood of Br Benbow and occupied
by the rector of the parrish had but 15 persons
attended his Church during the day while I had a large
congregation judged to be a thousand attended my
meetings through the day & evening, and as I arose in
the evening to speak at John Benbows house a man
entered the door and approached me and informed me
he was a constable sent by the rector of the parrish
with a warrant to arest me I asked him for what
crime, he said for preaching to the people, I told him
I had a license for the preaching ^of^ the Gospel to the people
as well as the rector, and if he would take a chair
I would wait upon him after meeting, he took my
chair & sat beside of me, I preached the first
principles of the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel for
an hour & a quarter the power of God rested upon me
the spirit of God filled the home the people were convinced
at the close of the meeting I opened a door forway to be saved, when I learned these things I could
clearly see why the Lord had commanded me while
in the town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] to leave that field of labor
and go to the South, for I could could clearly
see in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] a great harvest field for
gathering many saints into the Kingdom of God, I retired
to my bed with joy & rejoicing after offering my prayer
& thanksgiving to God, & slept sweetly until the
rising of the Sun; I arose in the morning of the 5th took breakfast
and told Mr [[John Benbow|Benbow]] I would like to commence my
Masters business by preaching the Gospel to the people
He had a large hall in his mansion which was licensed
for preaching, and he sent word through the Neighborhood
that an American Missionary would preach at his home
that evening, the time came, many of the Neighbors came in
& I preached my first Gospel sermon in ^his home^ the home. I also
preached on the following evening March 6, at his home
and baptized 6 persons including Mr John Benbow
& [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]] 4 of four of the six were preachers of the United
Order ^Brethren^, I spent most of the following day in clean
cleaning out a nice pool of water and prepared it
for baptizing in as I saw many were to be baptizedunto him and his houshold and the Inhabitants of
the land. Mr [[John Benbow|Benbow]] & his [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]] wife received me with
glad hearts and thanksgiving, it was in the evening when
I arrived having traveled during the day 48 mils by coach &
on foot, but after receiving refreshments we sat down
together & conversed untill two oclock in the morning, Br
& Sister Benbow rejoiced greatly at the glad tidings of
great joy which I brought unto them of the fullness
of the Everlasting Gospel which God had revealed through
the mouth of his prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] in these
last days, and I rejoiced greatly at the joyful news
that BMr Benbow gave me, that I was standing in the
midst of a company of men & women over 600 in
Number who had broaken of[f] from the Wesleyan
Methodist and taken the name of United Brethren
Had 45 preachers as ^among^ their number, had Chapels &
many Homes licensed according theto the Law of the land
for preaching in, and this Body of United Brethren were 
searching for light and truth but had gone as far
as they could, and were earnistly ^earnestly^ calling upon the
Lord to open the way before them, and send them
light and knowledge that they might know the trueChapter 6. My journey to [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]. Interviewed
with [[John Benbow|John Benbow]]. The word of the Lord fulfilled
to me. The greatest gathering into the Church known among the
Gentiles since the organization of the Church in this
despensation
On the 3rd of March 1840 in fulfillment of the word
of the Lord to me I took coach & rode to Wolverham-
pton 26 miles & spent the night on the morning of the
4 I again took coach & rode through [[Dudley, Staffordshire, England|Dudley]] 
[[Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England|Stourbridge]], [[Kidderminster, Worcestershire, England|Kideministon]], [[Stourport, Worcestershire, England|Stourport]], and
[[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] and then walked a number of miles to
Mr John Benbows, [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill Farme]], [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castle Froome]],
Ledbury Hereforshire Mr Benbow this was in
the South of England a farming country, a region
where No Morm Elder of the Latter Day Saints had
visited, I found Mr Benbow a wealthy farmer cultivating
300 acres of land, occupying a good mansion and a plenty
of means. His wife [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Jane]] had no children, I presented my-
self to them as a missionary from America an Elder
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, had been
sent to him by the commandment of God as a messenger
of Salvation to preach the Gospel of Life & SalvationMarch 1, 1840 was my birth day I being 33
years of age. It being on Sunday I preached
twice through the day to a large assembly in the
City Hall in the Town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] and broke bread
unto the Saints again in the evening I ^again^ met with a
large assemble of the Saints and strangers and while
singing the first Hymn the spirit of the Lord rested upon
me and the voice of the Lord said to me this is the 
last meeting that you will hold with this people
for many ^days^ I was asstonished at this as I had many
appointments out in that district, when I arose to
speak to the people I told them that it was the
last meeting I should hold with them for many days
they were as much asstonished as I was In the
at the close of the meeting several four came forward
for baptism and we went down into the watter & 
baptized them. In the morning I went in secret
before the Lord and asked him what his will was
concerning me and the ownly answer I got was to
go to the South for the Lord had a great work for
me to perform there as many souls were there waiting
for the word of the Lordafterwards this was done by the power of God
and not of man. We laid hands upon twenty
in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] who were sick and they were ^mostly^ healed
On the 21 I arrived in [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] by coach and
met for the first time with Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]]
This being my field of labor I stoped and commenced
work Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turly]] stoped in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|pottery]] District
some 8 days then went to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] his field of
labor in preaching baptizing bonfirming & blessing children
I received a letter on the 10 Feb from Elder John
Taylor at [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] saying they had commenced there and
baptized 10 person, I labored in the Staffordshire
potteries in Burslem, [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] [[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]] and
several other villages from the 22 Jan untill the
2nd day of March one month & 7 days preaching
ery night in the week and two or 3 times on the 
Sabbath I baptized, confirmed, & blessed many children
and we had a good field open for labor
and many were believing, and it appeared as though
we had a door open to bring many into the Church
in that part of the vineyardhave attempted to administer unto her with the
company present But as I was a stranger there and 
Br [[William Clayton|Clayton]] presiding over the branch I joined him in
administering to the woman. But the unbelief of the wicked
present was so great we could not cast the devil out
of her but she raged wors than before I then ordered
the room to be cleared, and when the company left
the home except the few attending upon her, we laid
Hands upon her and I commanded the devil to
come out of her in the Name of Jesus Christ, and the
devil left her and she was made whole and fell
asleep and the next day being the Sabbath she came
before a large Congregation of people and bore testimony
of what the Lord had done for her. We had a large
assembly through the day and evening to whom I preached
the gospel. on Monday morning the Devil not being
satisfied of being cast out of the woman entered a
little child belonging to the woman but a few months
old I was called upon to visit the child I found it in
great distress [unearthly] in its Mothers arms we laid
hands upon it and called the devil out of it and
the evil spirits had no power over the Householdprinciples of the Church had been explained by the
Twelve present the Council adjorned Elder Willard
Richards had been called to be one of the Quorum
of the Twelve but had not yet received his ordination
On the day following I parted with Elder
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] & [[Joseph Fielding|Fielding]] who wet went to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] &
with Elder Richards who tarried in [[Preston, Lancashire, England|preston]]
and Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] & myself went to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]
the first time I ever visited that City, I here
met with Elder [[William Clayton|William Clayton]] for the first time
as soon as I had an introduction to him
he informed me that one of the Sisters in the place
was possessed of the devil and he asked me to go and
cast him out of her Thinking that one of the Twelve
Apostles could do any thing they were a mind to. However
I went with him to the home where the woman lay in
the hands of three men in a terrible rage and trying
to tare her clothing off from her I also found quite
a number of Saints present and some unbelievers who
hagd come to see the devils cast out as a miricle
wrought. If I had acted my own mind I should [not] [page folded]Chapter 5 Our visit to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|preston]], our first council
in England, in 1840, we take different fields of Labor
Jan 13, 1840 After visiting ^Mr. [[George Cannon|George Cannon]]^ the Father and [[Ann Quayle Cannon|Mother]] of G Q
Cannon and the family after we took cars in the
Evening and arrived in the midst of the preston Branch
of the Saints built up in 1837, by Elder Heber C
Kimball & ^[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]^ [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and we very soon
had a pleasant interview with Elder Willard Richards
who had remained in preston to take care of the
Churches while the rest had returned home to America
We spent three days in preston in visiting the Saints
and on the 17, we held a council at Elder Richards
Home, in preston, Lancanshire England and after
consulting upon the best plan ^course^ for us to persue
it was finally resolved that Elders [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]
and [[Joseph Fielding|Joseph Fielding]] go to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] and Elder
Woodruff to [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire potteries]] & Theodore
Turley to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] his former place of residence
and that Elder Richards go where the spirit might
direct him and that [[William Clayton|Wm Clayton]] preside over
the Branch in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]. After variouswhich cost $15 each, we had storms & rough
weather, but most of the winds were favorable for
a quick passage while on the passage some Methodist
priest got into an argument against some Catholics
who were in the company, and the arguments of the priests
ran rather more into abuse than sound argument
and Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] told the Methodist priest that
he did not think it was becoming in a daughter
to find so much fault with the mother as they
did for as the Methodist came out from the 
Catholics, Elder Taylor thought the Mother had
as much right [ink blot] to enjoy their religion
unmolested as the daughter had that closed
the argument, our company consisted of 109 saints
composed of Englishmen Americans Englishman sct
schotish scotish, Irish, Welsh & Dutch,
[rest of page blank]I spent two months & seven days after my arrival
in [[New York|New York]] in travelling & preaching in New York
[[New Jersey|New Jersey]] & [[Long Island, Queens County, New York|Long Island]] a portion of the time
with [[Parley Parker Pratt|parly]] & [[orson Pratt|Orson pratt]] I had freequent attacks
during this time of the chills & fever but I preached
almost daily d on the 13 of Dec I attended a
Conference in [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York City]] with Parly P Pratt
and on that day Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] arrived in
our midst and it was a happy meeting he had
passed through a severe time of sickness after we
parted but through the mercy [ink blot] of God had been
preserved and was able to continue his journey. He 
also informed us that all of the others of the quorum
of the Twelve had suffered a great deal of sickness and
that it was with difficulty that they could travel
After spending 6 days in New York John Taylor Wilford 
Woodruff & [[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley]] sailed out of New York
Harbor for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] on board of the packet ship Oxford
On the 19th day of Dec 1839 and in the Liverpool docked
on the 11th Dec ^Jan^ making the voyage from New York to
Liverpool in 23 days we took steerage passagecough so much so that my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] never thought
I should never leave the home alive but when
they brought me the request of my dying uncle and the
day came for the Funeral, I told my Father to get his
hors & buggy ready for I was going to attend the funeral
He thought I was very presumtious as I had suffered
with the chills and fever some 15 days for and to 
attempt to speak in my weak state and to begin
at the same hour that my chill was to come on
was quite alarming to my parents yet according to my
request my [Father] got up his team and I rode with him
and my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step Mother]] five miles through a cold chilly
wind and I commenced speaking to a large congregation
at the same hour still my chills was to come on
and I spoke over one hour with Great freedom
and my chills left me from that hour and I
had no more return from it for many days
On the Monday following Oct 7, I felt sufficiently
returned to health to continue my journey I took the
parting hand with my Father, Mother, & [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Sister]] and
left for [[New York|New York]] where I arrived in the Morning of the 8th Novbaptized my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] & his household including my step 
mother & ownly [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] & organized a small branch 
of the Church [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|there]] of nine members eight of which 
were my blood relations and I was glad to meet 
with them upon this occasion as I found them all 
strong in the faith of the Gospel & glad to meet 
with me I was still suffering with the Ague 
daily. On the 27, Sept my Grand Mother (on my [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Mothers]] 
side) [[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|Anna Thompson]] died 84 years of age at 
[[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], it was a singular incident that she with 
her husband [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot Thompson]] and [[Mercy Thompson|Mercy Thompson]] and 
[[Samuel Thompson, b. 1709|Samuel Thompson]] all of one family died the 
year they were 84 years of age I was not able
to attend my Grand Mothers Funeral. On the 4
Oct ^1839^ my uncle [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart]] died aged 43 years I 
had visited him in his sickness and preached the 
Gospel to him and he was believing and on his 
death bed sent me a request that I would preach 
his funeral sermon I had been associated 
with him from my youth up I was at the time 
having the chills and fever daily afflicted with a severeinto the Hands of God though painful I took
the parting hand with [[John Taylor, b. 1808|him]] I left him in German-
town Wayne Co Indiana and in the Hands of a Merciful
God and a kind and benevolent family who promised 
to do every thing in their power to make him comfortable
untill his recovery, which they did do though he
passed through a severe course of the Billious fever
and was sick night [nigh] unto death but through the
mercy of God he recovered from his sickness and
contiued his journey and we next met in the City
of [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] I continued to journey with Father [[Zebedee Coltrin|Coultrin]]
to [[Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cleveland]] where we parted on the 10 Sept I went
on board of a steamer for [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]] but was 3 days
and night in a storm before we made the Harbor and
when we did land it was midnight and do so we ran
into a schooner & stowe it in, from Buffalo I traveled to
[[Albany, Albany County, New York|albany]] in a canal boat and had a shake of the
ague daily while on the journey. At Albany I took stage
in the night and rode to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] home in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]
on the 21st of Sept I had visited my Fathers family
on the in the summer of 1838 on my way to Fox
Islands on my second visit there and I hadOn the day following Sept 1, being Sunday Br [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] 
concluded to spend the day & hold a meeting it was
a German settlement Elder Taylor wished me to speak
which I did upon the first principles of the Gospel
Elder Taylor followed me & spoke untill he was
quite exhausted not realizing his bodily [condition]
we returned to the Inn where we were staying &
stopping I was taken with a chill & fever & 
had a sick night and Br Taylor was quite
sick. And the following day sept 2 was a painful
day to my feelings. It was evident that Br Taylor
had a setted fever upon him and would not be
able to travel and Father [[Zebedee Coltrin|Coultrin]] was resolved
to continue his journey and in consultation with
Taylor he thought it better for one sick man to be
left than for two as I was sick with the chills & fever
so that I was not co able to render him present assistance
and not able to take care of myself under these circumstances
Br Tayler advised me to continue with my journey with
Br Coltrin and make the best of my way to New-
York. Accordingly I done so After committing himbut I suffered much with the chills & fever Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]]
up to this time had appeared to enjoy excellent health but
the Destroyer did not intend to make him an exception
to the rest of the Apostles for on the 29 Aug he fell to
the ground as though he had been knocked down seemed to have
fainted away but soon revived but on the following day
it seemed as though the enemy made a powerful grasp
upon his life. He fainted away several times and seemed 
as though he would die we stoped several times with
him at a home by the way side we then took him into
a waggon & drove to Brother [[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|Horace S Eldridge]] and spent
the remainder of the day & night [feeding] him and in
the morning Br Tayler recovered so for that he thought
he would be able to ride so we started on our journey
on the Morning of the 30 and we travelled 40 miles to
[[Louisville, Henry County, Indiana|Louisville]] and spent the night with the family of Br
[[James Townsend|James Townsend]]. We felt terribly shaken up
being in such a weak state Br Townsend was absent
from home but we were kindly entertained by Sister [[Susan Davis Townsend|Townsend]]
in the morning Elder Taylor though very weak felt disposed
to try to continue his journey. We traveled 14 miles to 
[[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]] was quite sick at night and seemed 
to have the Billious fever setted settled upon him
and I was very feeble myself and spent the night with with a Brother [[Brother Merrill|Merrills]] 
the day following a Brother Perkins ^we rode 10 miles to Br Perkins and he^ took us in his
waggon and carried us to [[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|McComb]] from thence to 
Brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Carloss Smith]] I rode for hours during the day 
over a very rough road of stones and stumps lying  
on my back in the bottom of the waggon shaking with 
the ague and I suffered much. We held a meeting in 
a grove near Carloss Smith and here Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] baptized 
[[George Miller|George Miller]] who afterwards was ordained a Bishop, at 
the meeting the Saints gave us $9 & George Miller a horse 
to help us on our journey, I rode to [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] with 
Father [[Zebedee Coltrin|Coultrin]] where I had an interview with several 
families of the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Island]] Saints which I had brought 
up with me from Fox Islands in 1838 I spent several 
days with them and at [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] where Elder 
Taylor published fifteen hundred copies in pamphlet 
form of a brief schedule of the persecutions ^and suffering^ of the Latter
Day Saints by the inhabitants of the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]]. 
We sold our horse and in company with Coultrin Father
Coltrin Br Taylor & myself left Springfield & continued 
our journey  I having the chills & fever nearly every other 
day which made it very distressing for me to ride in a 
lumber waggon shaking with the ague on the 24 Aug we 
[rode to] [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre haute]] and spent the night with Dr [[Charles Burns Modesitt|Modesett]]desecting room than a missionary [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] replyied 
what did you say that for get up & go along all 
will be right with you. I name these incidents that 
the recorder may know how the Quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles started on their missions to [[England|England]] in 1839 
Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] was agoing with me and we were 
the two first ^two^ of the Quorum that started on the mission 
and Br Taylor was about the ownly well man there 
was in the Quorum the rest being sick soon a brother 
came along with a waggon and took us in as we 
were passing through the place we came to [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P Pratt]] 
who was strip[p]ed to his shirt and pants bare headed
& Barfoot hewing a log preparing to build him a 
cabbin cabin he says Br Woodruff I have got 
no money but I have got an empty purse which 
I will give you which he brought to me which 
I thanked him for went a few roads further & 
met Br [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] in the same condition as
Parley hewing a log to build a cabins. He says as
Parley has given you a purse I have got a doller 
I will give you to put in it, he gave me both
a doller & a blessing we drove 16 miles across a prarieChapter 4. 
Leaving my family, starting upon my missions
and Incidents upon the Journey
Aug 8, 1839 Early on this important morning I arose 
from my sick bed, laid my hands upon the head 
of my wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] and blessed her and departed from 
her ^the^ embrace of my companion and left her 
almost without food or raiment the necessaries of life 
she parted with me with this fortitude that becomes 
a Saint realizing the responsibility of her compan-
ion. Phebe farewell, be of good chear, remember
me in your prayers, I leave these pages for your 
perusal when I am gone, I shall see thy face again in 
the flesh I go to obey the command of Jesus Christ. 
Although feeble I walked to the Bank of the Mississippi
River there President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] took me in a
canoe (having no other [company]) & paddled me across the 
river I lay down on a side of sole leather by
the post office to rest some Br [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the prophet 
of God came along & looked at me Well Br Woodruff 
says he you have started on your Mission yes says 
I but I feel & look more like a subject for thewith chills and fever or sickness of some kind nearly
all the Quorum of the Twelve began to be sick and their 
families so it still required a good deal of faith 
and perserverance to be exercised in order to start off 
on a Mission with the chills & fever. On the 25 July 
for the first time in my life I was attacked with the 
chills & fever this I had every other day which laid 
me prostrate each day my chill was upon me My 
wife [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] was also soon taken down with chills & 
fever as were quite a Number of the Twelve I spent 18
^days^ in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] with my family after I was taken sick 
before I started upon my missions. The 17 day of August 
was the last day I spent at home in Montrose and although 
sick with the chills & fever most of the day I made 
what preparations I could to start on my ^the^ mission on the
morrow a mission of four thousand miles to preach 
the Gospel to the Nations of the Earth and that to without money 
purse or scrip with the power of disease resting upon 
with a shak[e] of the fever & ague each alternate day but 
but yet I do this freely for Christ sake trusting in 
him for the recompense of [renewal]. May the Lord give 
me grace according to my day and âcââs for my [ink blot] [fire] & 
a safe return to my family & friends while fââter [ink blot] ask
in the name of Jesus Christ Amenand keep in mind that it is a day of warning and
not of many words. Act honest before God & men beware
of sophestry such as bowing & scraping unto men in whom
you have no confidence be ^honest^ open and frank [illegible] in all
your intercourse with mankind I wish to say to
the Twelve and all the Saints to profit by this important key
that in all your trials, troubles, and temptations afflictions
bonds, imprisionsments and death se[e] to it that you do
not betray Jesus Christ that you do not betray your
Brethren, that you do not betray the revelations of God whether
in the bible Book of Mormon or Doctrin & Covenants or
any of the word of God Yea in all your troubles see that
ye do not this thing lest innocent blood be found in
your shirts and ye go down to Hell. We may ever know
by this sign that there is danger of our being lead to
a fall & aposticy when we give way to the devil so as to
neglect the first known duty but whatever you do do
not betray your friend the forg[o]ing are some of the important
instructions given to the Twelve by the prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]
before they started upon their missions
In as much as the devil had been in a means not [prevented]
by the Twelve going to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far west]] & returning without laâân it
seemed as though the Destroyer was determined to make
some other affect upon us to hinder our performing our
mission for it seemed that as soon as any one of the
A Apostles begins to prepare for starting they were smittento forgive our Brother on ther first intimation of repentance 
and asking forgiveness for our Heavently Father will be equilly
as merciful unto us also we ought to be willing to repent
of ^and confess^ all of our own sins and keep Nothing back and Let
the Twelve be humble and not be exhalted, and beware
of pride and not seek to excell one above another but act
for each others good and honirably make mention of each
others names ^in prayer^ before the Lord and before our fellow men
do not back bite or devour our brother. The Elders of Israel
should seek to learn by precept & example in this late age
of the world and be oblieged to learn ery thing we know
by sad experience [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] trust the remainder of the Twelve will
learn wisdom & not follow the example of those who have
fallen. When the Twelve or any other witness of Jesus Christ
stands before the congregations of the earth and they preach
in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and the
people are asstonished and confounded at the doctrin and
say that that man has preached a powerful discourse,
a great sermon then let that man or those men take
ease that they do not ascribe the Glory unto themselves but
be careful that they are humble and ascribe the praise &
Glory to God and the Lamb for it is by the power of the
Holy Ghost priesthood and the Holy Ghost that they have power
thus to speak, who art thou O man but dust, and
from whom dost thou receive thy power and blessings but
from God Then let the Twelve Apostles and Elders of Israel
observe this [FIGURE] key and be wise, ye are not sent out to be
taught but to teach. Let every man be sober be be
vigilent and let all his words be received with GraceChapter 3rd preparing for our journey & Mission
The blessings of the prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] upp upon our
heads and his promises upon us. The power of the
Devil manifest to hinder our performing our Mission
(on the 1st day of July Joseph Smith & his counsellors Sidy
Rigdon & [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] to spend
the day with the Twelve and set them apart & bless them
before they started upon their missions there were twelve
in number & dined at my House. After dinner we
assembled at [[Brigham Young|Brigham Youngs]] Home for our Meeting
Br Hyrum Smith opened by prayer After which the presidency
laid their hands upon our heads & gave us a
blessing president Rigdon was mouth in blessing me they also
blessed Sisters [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]], [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Tayler]] & [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] the prophet Joseph
promised us if we would be faithful we should again
return to our families & friends and be blessed upon
our missions and have many souls as seals of our
ministry and returne again in peace and safety to
our families & friends (all of which was fulfilled) Br Hyrum
ordained us to preach the first principles of the Gospel
and thought that was about as much as this genera-
tion could endure. Then Joseph arose and preached some
precious things of the Kingdom of God unto us in the power of the
Holy Ghost some of which I will mention from my journal
Ever keep in exercise the principal of mercy and be readywhen we left Br [[Joseph Bates Noble|Nobles]], the prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] went
onto the bank of the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] waiting for the Ferry boat
to return back home with those who accompanied
him. We accompanied him to the river
while waiting for the boat a man came to Joseph
Smith of the world, knowing of the miricles which had
been performed he having a pairs of twin children
about 5 months old old and both laying [each]
night unto death aske[d] the prophet of he would
not go and heal them but they were some 2 miles
from [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] the prophet said he could not go
but after pausing some time he said he would
send some one to heal them and he turned to me
and said you go with the man & heal his children
and he took a bandanna red silk hankerchief
out of his pocket and gave to me and told me to
wipe their faces with the hankerchef when I administered
to them and they should be healed and he said unto me
as long as you will keep that hankerchief it shall
remain a league between us you and me I went
with the man and done as the prophet commanded
me & the children were healed and I keep possession
of the hankerchief unto this day.dangerously sick when we entered the home Brother
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] took him by the hand and commanded him
in the Name of Jesus Christ to arise & be made whole
and he arose & was immediately healed, and while this
was going on the wicked mob in the place led by one
R Mourn had became alarmed and followed us into
Br [[Joseph Bates Noble|Nobles]] Home But before them arrived in the
Home Br Joseph had called upon Br [[Elijah Fordham|Fordham]] to
offer prayer and while he was praying the mob entered
with all the evil spirits that accompanied them
as soon as they entered Br Fordham who was
praying fainted & sank to the floor as soon as
Joseph saw the mob in the home he aâââ and bid
the room cleared of both that class of Men and
^Devils^ immediately Br Fordham came to and finished
his prayer, it shows what power evil spirits
have upon the tabernacles of men and the saints
are ownly saved from the power of the devil by the
power of God. This case of Br Nobles was the last
case of healing of the day. It was the Greatest Day of
the power of God and of healing members on the Earth
since the organization of the Church and Kingdoma healthy color came to face, and life was m[an]-
ifest in ery act. His feet were done up in 
Indian Mud poltices, He kicked it off his feet and
scattered its contents and he called for clothes put
them on called for a boul of bread & milk & eat
it put on his hat and followed us into the street
to visit others who were sick. The unbeliever may
ask was there not deception in this, if there is any 
deception in the mind of the unbeliever There was 
none with [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]] the dying man nor
with those who were present, with him for a few minutes
more he would have been in the spirit world which to day
^through the blessings of God he lived up to 1880 in which year^
June 24 1880 being 41 years since that event he is alive in the
^he died in Utah^
Mortal body in [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] while all who were with 
him on that occasion with the exception of two are in the
spirit world, Among the Number were [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] & [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]]
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] George A.
Smith and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parly Pratt]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] & Wilford Woodruff
are the ownly two living who were present at the time and
we soon shall mingle with those who have gone. 
as soon as we left Bro Fordhams we next visited
the House of [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B Nobles]] who lay very low and& took him by the right hand [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] 
[page covered] [hol]ding his hat in his left hand Br Joseph saw
that his eyes were glazed He speechless and uncon-
cious He held his hand in his looking him in 
the sp face He says Br [[Elijah Fordham|Fordham]] Do you not know
me[?] at first he made no reply but we could all
see the effects of the Spirit of God resting upon him
He again said Elijah do you not know me[?] with 
a low whisper he said yes, He then said have you
not faith to be healed, His answer a little planer
was I am afraid it is to late if you had come
sooner I think I might have been, He had the appearance
of a man waking out of sleep, it was from the sleep
of Death Joseph then said do you not believe that
Jesus is the Christ, I do Br Joseph. Then the prophet
of God spoke with a loud voice as in the Majesty of
the GodHead Elijah I command you in the Name
of Jesus of Nazareth to arise and be made whole. The
words of the prophet was not like word of man but
like the voice of God. It seemed to me that the House shook
from its foundation, Elijah Fordham leaped from 
his bed like a man raised from the dead [to] life andthis occasion [[Joseph Smith Jr.|he]] healed all in his house and
door yard Then in company with [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] &
several of the Twelve [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber Kimball]] & [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P Pratt]] who had
just got out of prison accompanied him and he
^went^ through among the sick lying on the bank of the [[Mississippi River, United States|River]]
and he commanded in a loud voice in the name
of Jesus Christ to come up and be made whole and
they were all healed and when they had healed all
that were sick on the East side of the river they crossed
the Mississippi river in a ferry boat to the west side
to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] where we were. The first home they went
into was President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Youngs]] who was on his
bed sick at the time BThe prophet went into his
home and healed him and they all come out together
as they were passing by my door Brother Joseph sayes
Brother Woodruff follow me this was the ownly word
spoken by any of the company from the time they left
Brother Brighams House till we crossed the public square
and entered into Brother [[Elijah Fordham|Fordham]] House He had
been dying for an hour and we expected each minute
would be his last I felt the power of God that  
was overwhelming the prophet of God when we entered
the House Br Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham[page covered] [w]ith our families both went into one room 
[page covered] [a]bout 14 feet square. Finally Br [[Brigham Young|Young]] obtained a 
room and moved into it by himself then Orson 
Pratt & family moved into the same room with 
myself and family, ^A day of Gods Power^ while I was living in these cabins
with in the old barracks we experienced a day of Gods 
with the prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. It was a very sickly time 
and Joseph had given up his Home in [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] to
the sick and had a tent pitched in his door yard 
and was living in that himself, and the large emigration 
who had been driven out of [[Missouri|Missouri]] was flocking into
Commerce but had no homes to go into was lying 
in the waggons in tents & on the ground and many 
were sick though the expenses they were subject to 
and Br Joseph had waited on the sick untill 
he was worn out and nearly sick himself. But in 
the morning of the 22 July 1839 he arose in the
morning reflecting upon the salvation of the Saints 
of God in their persecutions & affilictions and he
called upon the Lord in prayer and the power of 
God rested upon him mightely and he arose up
^in the Name of^ as [did] Jesus healed all the sick around him in his day
So Joseph the prophet of God healed all around him uponother another entered his back and came out at 
the breast a ball passed through each hip each leg 
and each arm all this was while he was running for 
life and as strange as it may appear, all those wounds 
with one broaken rib did not lessen his speed
but he out run his enemies & carried his life 
we can ownly acknowledge it to be by the power 
and Mercy of God, president [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] was also 
among the number He also fled although the balls flew
around him like lââd yet he was not wounded How 
marvelous are the ways of the Lord
Before starting upon our missions to [[England|England]] 
we were under the necessity of settling our 
families, And as a place called [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]]
afterwards called Named [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] was chosen 
for our people to settle I left [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] in 
company with El Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] & our
families on the 15 May and arrived in Commerce
on the 18th and after an interview with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] 
we crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] into the old Military Barracks
in [[Iowa|Iowa]], and there took up our alode abode 
for our Families, President Brigham Young and myselfexcept those who have born the Holy priesthood 
and been in tribulation for the Gospel sake after 
spending the day together with returned to our families at 
night. On the day following May 4, we met in conference 
in [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] The prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] presiding which caused 
great joy to all the Saints, much business was done 
on the 4, but on Sunday the 5 May Joseph Smith addressed
the assembly followed by [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] & the Twelve 
Apostles the spirit of the Lord was poured out upon us 
and we had a glorious day.
On the following day May 6, I met with the Seventies & 
we ordained 60 men into the Quorum of Elders & Seventies
Brother Joseph met with the Twelve, ^Bishops^ and Elders of 
Bishp ^Bishop^ [[Edward Partridge|Partridges]] Home, and there was a number with 
us who was wounded at [[Haun's Mill, Braymer, Caldwell County, Missouri|Hauns Mill]] among the number
was, [[Isaac Laney|Isaac Laney]], who was in company with about 
Twenty others at the Mill. A large armed Mob ^fell upon^ and
^them^ with rifles and other weapons and shot down 17 
of the Brethren & wounded others Brother Laney fled from the 
scene but the[y] poured a shower of led after him which 
peirced his body through and through, He showed eleven
ball holes in his body, there were 27 in his shirt 
7 in his pantaloons, and his coat litteraly cut to 
peaces one ball entered one arm pit & came out of the liberated through the blessings of God from his enemies 
& prison and passed us not far distant from each
other without either party knowing it, they making their 
way for their families in [[Illinois|Illinois]] while we were making 
our way to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] into the hands ^midst^ of our enemies 
so they arrived home to their families & friends before 
our return. May 3rd was a very interesting day to 
me as well as others. In company with 5five others 
of the Quorum of the Twelve we rode four miles 
out of town to Mr [[John Cleveland|Clevelands]] to visit Br Joseph 
Smith & his family we arrived at his home & once more 
had the happy privelege of taking Br Joseph by the hand 
two years had rolled away since I had seen his face.
He greeted us with great joy as did [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] and 
[[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] all of whom had escaped their imprisonment 
to gether they had been confined in prison six months 
and been under sentence of death three times, but yet
their lives were in the hands of God and He had
delivered them and they were now mingling with their 
wives children & friends and out of the reach of the 
mob and Joseph was frank open and familiar 
in âââd our rejoicing was great. No man 
can comprehend feel, sens or understand the joy 
or sensation that is created by such a meeting[[Darwin John Chase|Darwins Chase]] and [[Norman Shearer|Norman Shearer]] (who had 
just been liberated from [[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]] prison) were 
also ordained to the office of Seventies. The Twelve 
then offered up vocal prayer in the following order 
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] [[John Edward Page|John E Page]] 
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] Wilford Woodruff and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]
After which they sung Adam^on^di Aman and then the 
Twelve took their leave and parting hand of the following 
Saints agreeable to revelation viz A Brother Elias 
Smith, Norman Shearer, [[William Burton|Wm Burton]], [[Stephen Peck|Stephen Pecke]], 
[[Artimesia Granger|Artemusia Granger]], [[Martha Peck|Martha Peck]], [[Sarah Melissa Granger Kimball|Sarah Granger]]
[[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley]], [[Hiram Clark, b. 1795|Hiram Clark]], & [[Daniel Shearer|Daniel Shearer]],
Then we took the parting hand of this small remnant 
of Saints who remained on the Temple ground to see us 
fulfill this revelation of God and commandment of God, 
and turned our back upon [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] and [[Missouri|Missouri]]
and returned to [[Illinois|Illinois]], and we accomplished this mis-
sion without a dog to move his tongue on any man 
to say why do you so. We reached [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] crossed the 
[[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] on the steem ferry & entered Quincy on the 
2nd day of May and we all had the joy of receiving our 
families once more in peace & safety un There was an 
incident unaccounted with our journey well worthy of record
that while we were on our journey to fulfill the revelation 
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the prophet & his companions in chains had got and though the prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] & [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]]
with other leading men were in the hands of our
enemies and in chains & in prison still we
moved on to the Temple Ground in the City of [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]]
and held a council and fulfilled the revelation
and commandment given unto us, and among 
other things that we performed at this Council we
excommunicated from the Church 31 person who
had apostetized from the Church and turned to be our
enemies. The mission of the Twelve was sung
we then repaired to the South East Corner of the
Temple Ground and with the arrival of Elder [[Alpheus Cutler|^Alpheus^ Cutler]] the
Master workman of the building Committee, we
laid the South East ^Club^ Corner of Stone of the Temple
according to revelation there were present of the
Twelve Apostles [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]]
[[Orson Pratt|Orson pratt]] [[John Edward Page|John E page]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] who proceeded
to ordain Wilford Woodruff and [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]
to the office of the Apostleship and as members of the
Quorum of the Twelve in the place of those who had
fallen as they had been called by revelation
Then vocal prayer was offered up in the following order
[[Darwin John Chase|Darwin Chase]] & [[Norman Shearer|Normon Shearer]]
Brigham Young Heber C Kimballof one man said the Lord God had spoken and
it was for us to obey, It was the Lords business
to take care of his saints and we would
fulfull the commandment or die a trying. According
to our revalation on the 18 April 1839 I
took into my waggon [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] & Orson
Pratt and Father [[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]] took into his waggon
[[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]] & [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] & George A Smith
On the way we overtook [[John Edward Page|John E Page]] who was
on his way with his family to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] Ill His
waggon had turned over and when we met him
he was trying to gather up a barrel of soft soap
with his hands, we helped him right up his
waggon he drove down into the vally below
and accompanied us on to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|far west]]. On the
night of 25 April we arived at Far West and spent
the night at the Home of [[Morris Phelps|Morris Phelps]] who was
still in prison On the morning of the 26 April
1839, Notwithstanding the threats of our Enemies
that the revelation that was to be fulfilled this
day should not be and Notwithstanding that
ten thousands of the saints had been driven out of
the [[Missouri|state]] by the edict of the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Governor]]under the Edict of Gov [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]] and the Missourians
had sworn that if all the other revelations of 
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] were fulfilled that should not be
as it had a day & date to it and they would see
that it should not be fulfilled. It almost seemed
as though the Lord having a foreknowledge of what
would take place had placed a day & date to
that revelation to see whether the Apostles would
obey that revelation at the risk of their lives
when the time drew near for the fulfillment of
this commandment of the Lord [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]
being then president of the Twelve (As Thomas B.
Marsh had fallen) He called the Twelve together into
[illegible] then at [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quency]] Illinois to see what our
Minds would be about going to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] to
fulfill the revelation Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] the
patriarch and others who were present did not
think it wisdom for us to attempt it as our
lives would be at stake and thought the Lord
would take the will for the deed But when
president Young asked the Twelve what their feelings
were upon the sub[ject] [page torn] We all of us as in the voiceThe ^W. Woodruffs^ [[England|Englands]] Missions of 1840
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the prophet asked the Lord what 
his will was concerning the Twelve, and the Lord 
answered in a revelation given July 8, 1838
in which the Lord says Let them take leave 
of my Saints in the City [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] on the 
26 day of April next on the building spot 
of my Home saith the Lord, Let my servant 
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and also my servant [[John Edward Page|John E Page]] 
and also my servant Wilford Woodruff and also 
my servant [[Willard Richards|Willard]] patriarch be appointed to fill
the places of those who have fallen and be 
officially notified of their Appointment.
It will be observed that different from nearly 
all other revelations in the instant a day & date
was given and place was given for the commencment 
of this Mission and when this revelation was 
given all was peace & quiet And in [[Missouri|Missouri]] & at 
Far West but before the time being for the fulfillment
of that revelation The Saints of God had been driven 
out of the State of Missouri into [[Illinois|Illinois]] underX' July 5, 1848, (while on a mission to the Eastern States)
I drove my carriage, containing myself and family into the door yard of
bro. [[James Williams|James Williams]] in [[Iowa|Iowa]], to camp for the night; I tied my mules to a
large oak tree several rods from the carriage; as we were about to lay down
in the carriage for the night, I was strongly impressed to go and move my
mules from the oak tree, and also to move my carriage; I followed the
dictates of the Spirit, and removed my mules to a small hickory grove,
also moved my carriage several rods, and retired to rest.

In a short time a heavy rain storm came on, which broke
the tree near the ground, and laid it prostrate where my carriage had stood,
as it was, the top struck the hind end of the carriage; the tree was
2 feet in diameter; thus, by obeying the whisperings of the spirit, myself
and family were preserved.
A synod of church ministers became so alarmed for their 
flocks in that part of the vineyard, they petitioned parliament 
to adopt some measures to stop our preaching, they got ^received^ for 
an answer, that if they were as well acquainted with the 
Bible as their hunting grounds, and were as much interested 
in the welfare of the souls of men, as the chasing of the 
stags and foxes, they would not loose so many of their congregations.

Aug. 18th, I visited [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] in company with Elders H.
C. Kimball and [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]], I labored with them in establish-
ing a church, spending over 5 months in that populous city.

We visited nearly every part of the city, and all the 
notable places that we could have access to.

I attended all the general conferences in England,
and set sail with my brethren of the Twelve on the ship, Rochester 
April 20, 1841â arrived in [[New York|New York]] May 20,.

I went to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], Maine, got ^after^ my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]], and also ^also^ 
my son, [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]], whom I had not before seen, he was born 
March 22, 1840. My daughter [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] had died July 17, 1840.

I returned to New York and started for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], 
via the [[Great Lakes, United States|Lakes]], was wrecked on [[Lake Michigan, United States|Lake Michigan]] in the steamer 
Chesapeake, but arrived in Nauvoo in safety Oct. 6 1841, when 
I had the happy privilege of meeting with the Prophets [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] 
and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], and my brethren of the Twelve.

I bought a log house of brother [[Moses Tracy|Tracy]], on Lot No 1,
Block 106, on Hotchkiss and Durffee Streets, Prest Joseph Smith 
afterward,s gave me the Lot.

I spent ^the^ winter of 1841â2, attending meetings 
councils and laboring with my hands, I attended the 
[[Nauvoo Provision Store, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo House provision Store]] until the 3rd Feby. 1842,
when I take took charge of the ^business department of the^ [[Nauvoo Printing Office, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|printing office]] in
connection with Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]].

On the 5th of March, [blank] ^my Daughter, [[Phebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe, Amelia]], was born.

Sept 24th The Printing office took fire in the upper 
story in the midst of a large amount of paper, and it
came near burning up. was with difficulty extinguished.
the mob surrounded the pool, armed with stones, I 
dismissed the meeting and went away, but the congregation 
and mob remained on the ground till midnight, and 
as there was no prospect of their dispersing and the candidates 
were anxious to be baptized, I went down in to the water 
and baptized five in the mist of a shower of stones,
the water was all in a foam for a rod around me,
none that I baptized were hit, and I was only hit 
twice, once on my hip and once on my head, the one ^blow^ on 
my head raised a large bump, it which went away while
I was confirming: S^s^ubsequently I baptized many of the mob.

Subsequently I left next morning for [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] and attended 
the conference with the Twelve, and returned to [[Herefordshire, England|Hereforshire]]
accompanied by Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], on the 22nd April, 
and was soon joined by Elder [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]. Elder 
Young remained with me twenty seven days, preaching,
baptizing, confirming and counciling; numbers were added 
daily to the church: he then returned to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]].

I spent about seven months in Herefordshire, 
[[Gloucestershire, England|Glo^uce^stershire]] and [[Worcestershire, England|Worcestershire]], we baptized over 
eighteen hundred including all of the United Brethren 
save one: we baptized over two hundred preachers 
of various denominations in that part of the vinyard

[line through remainder of page]the people it was the last meeting I should hold 
with them for a season, it created much excitement. 
I had appointments out for a week, which I got Bro. 
[[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] to fill. I went before the Lord in prayer and 
asked him where I should go, the Spirit said, go to the 
south. According to the directions of the Spirit, on the 
3rd March I went to [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], and called upon
[[John Benbow|John Benbow]] at [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castlefroom]]; here I found a people 
prepared for the Gospel. I preached twice at his house. 
On the 6th I baptized 6 persons including John Benbow 
and [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]]. I here found a society called "United 
Brethren," numbering about six hundred members, 
and about 50 preachers, [[Thomas Kington|Thos. Kington]] was the presiding Elder; 
they came from all quarters to hear me preach and 
believed my testimony and I preached and baptized 
daily; the Ministers of the Church of England sent three 
church clerks to see what I was doing and I baptized 
them. One constable came to arrest me for preaching, and 
I baptized him. In about 30 days days I baptized 160, 
forty eight of which ^whom^ were preachers of the United 
Brethren including their presiding Elder, Thomas 
Kington.

I established forty two preaching places licensed 
according to law.

On the 9th April I had an appointment at Haw
Cross, as I was going into the meeting, letters were put 
into my hands from Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and others 
informing me of his arrival with five of the Twelve,
and requested me to come to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], and attend a 
general conference,â a vast assembly had gathered at
to attend my meeting, the house, yard and street 
wasere crowded, a mob had also gathered; I preached 
to the people, five came forward and wished to be baptized
1839

On the 19th, Decr in company with Elders [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] 
& [[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley]] I went on board the packet ship "Oxford"
and sailed for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]], where I landed January 11th, 1840, in
good health and spirits. When I left my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]], he gave me
some money to assist in paying my passage, also gave me
five dollars which he requested me to keep until I arrived
in Liverpool, saying, I would there need it; this I found
to be true after landing; that money was all we had
to pay our expenses to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]]; and we had two pence left.

We arrived in Preston on the 13th had a happy interview
with Bro. [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]; held a council and agreed
that Elder Taylor go to Liver-pool, Turley to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]
and I go to [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]].

18th, I arrived in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]; met Elder [[William Clayton|Wm. Clayton]]
who presided over that branch, numbering 164 members, I 
was immediately called upon to visit a woman possessed
with the Devil; she was raging and foaming, and had
to be held by four men, the more we rebuked the Devil the
worse she raged; we continued to pray and administer
until we conquered and cast the Devil out of her, she
arose and gave thanks to the Lord. The Devil then entered
into a young child and we cast the Devil ^him^ out of the
child. I preached several times and laid hands on
twenty eight persons. I then went to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] on the 21st
and met with Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]], President of the Burslem
branch, which numbered 66. I commenced preaching in
the Staffordshire Potteries, Elder Taylor^urley^ left for Birmingham
on the 29th. I remained in the Potteries some forty days, preaching
daily, baptizing, confirming and blessing children.

On the 1st March ^1,^ as I met in the evening with a
large assembly in [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]], the Lord revealed unto me
that it would be the last time meeting that I would hold
with the Saints in the Potteries for many days; I told
I committed [[John Taylor, b. 1808|him]] into the hands of God; and the 
family promised to do all in their power to make him 
comfortable; I parted with ^from^ him with a heavy heart.

Sep. On the 2nd, Novr. I continued my journey with 
Father [[Zebedee Coltrin|Coltrin]] to [[Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cleveland]], Ohio, I there took steamer on the 
10th for [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]]; had a severe gale and did not reach 
Buffalo until the 12th. I traveled to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]] on a canal 
boat, had the ague daily, was very sick, had no com-
panion except a sectarian priests who wasere daily lying
lying about the Mormons. I took stage at Albany 
for [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Ct. on the night of the 19th, and rode all 
night and the following day, suffered severely with fever 
and ague; I arrived at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house in Farmington on 
the 21st, quite sick; I found my father and family all well.

On the 27th Sep., 1839, my Maternal Grand-mother, 
[[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|Anna Thompson]], died aged 84; I was too sick to attend 
her funeral. It is a singular incident, that my Grandfather 
, [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot Thompson]], and Anna Thompson, his wife, [[Samuel Thompson, b. 1709|Samuel Thompson]] 
and [[Mercy Thompson|Mercy Thompson]] all of one family died in their 84
th year.

On the 4th October, [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adnera Hart]], died, bro^ther^ to my 
[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step mother]], ^died,^ aged 43, he requested me to preach his funeral 
sermon; I had been sick at my father's house with the 
ague for fifteen days, attended with a severe cough, and 
the hour appointed for the funeral to take place was the 
time for my ague, yet I gave out the appointment,
attended the funeral, and preached, an hour and a half
and I had no more ague for many days,. I left on 
the 7th, [blank] and visited [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]], [[Long Island, Queens County, New York|Long Island]], ^&^ New 
Jersey; but was in very poor health.

Nov 1st, I assisted Elders [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clark]], [[Alexander Wright|Wright]] and [[Samuel Mulliner|Mulliner]]
to set sail for [[England|England]]. Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], ^had^ recovered from 
his sickness, and arrived in New York on the 13th Decr,
on your mission".  I thanked [[Joseph Smith Jr.|him]]. A Bro., came along with 
a wagon and carried me a few miles on my road, I started
without purse or scrip; I ^&^ passed by [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] who was 
hauling ^e^ ^hewing^ logs for a house, he was bare-foot, bare-headed, with-
out coat or vest on, he said "I have no money but I have 
an empty purse, I will give you that." I went a few rods 
and found Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|^H. C.^ Kimball]] building a log cabin, he said
"I have one dollar I will give you that to put in your purse" 
he blessed me and I went my way, accompanied by Elder 
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]. I had a shake of the ague every other day,
and lay on the bottom of the wagon while I traveled.

We staid with [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel ^H.^]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|^Don^ Carlos Smith]] at [[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]] 
& held a meeting with the Saints, in that ^place whereo^ they contributed 
$9 to ^our^ necessities, and [[George Miller|Geo. Miller]] gave us a horse.
Father [[Zebedee Coltrin|Coltrin]] was going East, he took us into his wagon 
to help us along; we spent five days in [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] *
[paper inserted over page]
*where Elder Taylor had printed fifteen hundred copies of a the
pamphlet, upon the [[Missouri|Missouri]] persecution; also ^had^ had a trial
with Elder [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Babbitt]] ^who^ having prefered a charge against him
for improper conduct. We sold our horse
[end of paper inserted over page]
we administered to him, and he revived; on the follow-
ing day he fell again, and fainted several times, it 
seemed as though the destroyer would take his life; we 
traveled with him 4 days after he was taken sick. 
His sickness proved to be an attack of the billious 
fever, we stopped with him two days, at a Mormon ^German^
Tavern in [[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]], Wayne Co., Indiana, with a 
kind family, with whom he was acquainted; Father 
Coltrin would stay no longer; I proposed to remain 
with bro. Taylor, but as I was sick with fever & ague,
and not able to take care of myself, bro. Taylor advised 
me to continue my journey with Father Coltrin, saying
"it is easier to take care of one sick man, than two."
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] from time to time, as I had opportunity.

July 22nd. I was with Prest. Joseph Smith and his council 
and the Twelve, it was a day of Gods power with the pr
Prophet., H^h^e healed many who were sick nigh unto death, among 
whom were [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]] and [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Nobles]]; even 
the wicked rabble followed to see the sick healed; as Joseph 
was about to cross the river a man came to him and asked 
him if he would go about 3 miles and heal two of his small 
children, who were twins, about 3 months old, and were sick nigh 
unto death; he was a man of the world, he had never heard 
a sermon preached by a latter-day Saint. Joseph said he could 
not go, but he would send a man, after a momen hesitating 
a moment, he turned to me and said you go with this man 
and heal his children, at the same time giving me a red 
silk handkerchief, and said, after you lay hands upon them, 
wipe their faces with it and they shall be healed; and as 
long as you will keep that handerkerchief it shall ever remain 
as a league between you and me: I went and did 
as I was told commanded, and the children wasere healed.

On the 25th I was attacked with the chills and fever; 
I had a chill every other day and was very sick.

On the ^Augt.^ 8th Octr. I laid my hands upon my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and 
children, blessed them, committed them into the hands of 
God, and started upon my English mission, leaving my 
family sick, and with not more than 4 days provisions. 
Bro. [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] rowed me across the river ^[[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]]^ in a boat; I was 
sick and feeble; when I landed I laid down upon the bank 
of the river on a side of Sole leather; the Prophet Joseph came 
along and looked at me and said, "You are starting on your 
mission";  I said yes, but I look like a poor instrument for a 
missionary, I look more fit for a hospital or dis^s^ecting room 
than a mission; he replied "what do you say that for, go ahead 
in the name of the Lord, and you shall be healed and blessed

Copy of No. 21, Vol. VIII.[page torn] uspense until Oct. 1, when Elder [[James Townsend|Townsend]]
[page torn] ompany; they arrived in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] on the
[page torn] th their wagon covers all flying.

The company stopped at the house of sister Sarah
B. Foss; we went to work and nailed down all the covers
and painted them, which made them waterproof

4th, we started upon our journey, my [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child]] was in
the first stages of the hooping cough, our company consisted of 53
persons; we had 10 wagons, with a pair of horses to each. We had
before us, at this late period, a gloomy land journey of two thousand
miles, from [[Maine|Maine]] to [[Missouri|Missouri]]; we continued to travel through
rain, mud, cold, frost and snow, until I ^we^ arrived in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]],
Sangammon Co., Illinois, Dec. 19, where I stopped and settled 
my family and company for the winter ^being unable to proceed further,^; my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] had passed
through a severe course of the brain fever while upon the journey,
and her suffering had been very great, her spirit had left her
body twice to all human appearance, and only been called back
through the prayer of faith and the power of God. Our child
had also been very sick and I had become so thoroughly
chilled through my whole system, in crossing the bleak prairies,
that it was two months after I stopped before I got sufficiently
warmed to feel natural.

Bro. [[Nathaniel Thomas|Thomas]] buried one child, and nearly all the
company had been sick through exposure; some of them had stopped
by the way side.

I spent the winter laboring with my hands for the
support of my family.

March 8th, 1839 I attended a conference at [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], Ills.,
the kingdom of God, which was words were fulfilled this day.

I confirmed those baptized and organized this small 
branch of the church, consisting of 9 members, 8 of whom 
were relatives, I ordained [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]] a priest, and ad-
ministered the sacrament. unto them.

July 3rd, I started for the state of [[Maine|Maine]] and 
arrived at Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]] in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] on the 6th.

14th, My [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] was delivered of a daughter at 
her fathers house; w we named her [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]].

22nd, I wrote to [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B. Marsh]] an account 
of my labors upon [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox islands]] and the eastern country.

30th, I left Scarborough and returned to the islands,
I preached several times to large congregations in the Methodist 
meeting house, in [[East Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|East Thomastown]], and in the town hall in 
[[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Cambden]], before crossing to the islands, where I arrived Augt. 7

9th, I received a letter from Thomas B. Marsh 
informing me of my appointment to fill the place of in 
the Quorum of the Twelve, of one who had fallen, and I 
was requested to come to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] as soon as possible to 
prepare for a mission to [[England|England]] in the Spring. I immed-
iately visited all the Saints upon both islands, and earnestly 
exhorted them to sell their property and prepare themselves
to accompany me to the body of the church in [[Missouri|Missouri]].
Several immediately sold, but many were poor.  Bro Nath.
Thomas said he would furnish means to help off all the 
poor saints who would desired to go, and for this purpose 
went with me to the main land on the 13th, and I 
assisted him in procuring ^purshasing^ two thousand dollars worth of horses, 
^harness,^ wagons, & tents &c. ^camp^ for the company, he paid about $1,500 of the 
expenses himself, $1,000 of which went to furnish conveyance for the 
poor, after purchasing the outfit for the company, and ^I^ urginged the importance
of their starting as soon as possible, not later than the first of Sep.

Aug. 19, I left the town of Camden where we had prepared 
our outfit, and returned to Scarborough, to prepare my family for 
the journey, expecting to see the company in a few days, but here I
with the intention of breaking up the work upon these [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]], 
but it did not accomplish it.

11th, I was visited by Elders [[James Townsend|Townsend]] and Milton 
Holmes, who attended conferences with me upon both islands, and 
bore their testimony to the people, but the spirit of opposition 
increased to a great height. I was warned by the spirit ^of the Lord^
to leave for a season, and take a western mission; after visiting 
the saints from house to house, and praying with, and encour-
aging them, I left on the 28th, and went to the main land 
with Elders Townsend & Holmes. Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] returned to her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Fathers]];. 
We walked to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]];â & I left May 7th, and walked to Brad-
ford where I left Elder Holmes, and proceeded to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]].

11th, I gave out an appointment to preach at Sister 
[[Ruth Daggett Vose Sayers|Vose's]] room, & I went to [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] to visit Elder A. P. Rock-
wood who had been imprisoned in jail on pretence of debt,
but in reality out of religious persecution; the jailor locked me 
in until 10 p.m.; but while it disappointed a congregation of 
people, it gave me a happy visit with Elder Rockwood, conversing 
upon the work of God. On my return to Boston the people 
were waiting to hear me, I spoke to them a short time.

14th, I left Boston and walked some 30 miles to 
[[Holliston, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Holliston]], staid at Deacon [[John Haven|Hoveys^aven's^]] and preached; I walked to

arrived on the 18th, met with and attended meetings with bro.

[[Newburgh, Orange County, New York|Newburgh]] and preached in several towns in New York & [[New Jersey|New Jersey]],
and walked accross the country to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Conn. and arrived 
at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|fathers]] house June 11, (1838)

I commenced preaching at my fathers house; July 
1st, I baptized six persons in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]], including my Father, 
[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step mother]] and my ownly sister, [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]], also cousin [[Seth Woodruff|Seth Woodruff]], 
aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna Cossett]] and [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]], a Methodist class leader, 
who was boarding at my Fathers house.

When the Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith Sen.]] gave me my 
blessing, he said, I should bring my fathers household into
to see what effect this would have, I warned them in the 
name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgements of God that 
awaited the wicked, and shook my garments in the presence of 
the people, and told them I was clear of their blood,  byut they 
only heard my voice intermingled with the roar of cannon and 
musketry; before I closed speaking, the sailors went back on board 
of the revenue cutter. At the close of the meeting I baptized 
2, two, also one next day, and while baptizing the mob again 
commenced firing guns.  The bBaptists and Methodists got up the 
mob. Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglass]], the methodist priest, when argument failed him,
applied to all the magistrates for warrants against me; they 
refused to grant them, as he had no cause of complaint but
religious persecution.

March 8,: Elder Townsend returned home.

March 22, I accompanied bro. [[Cyrus Starrett|Stirrat]] at low tide, on 
to a bar some 40 rods from shore, to dig some clams, we 
were soon joined by Mrs. Woodruff and a sister [[Sarah Stone|Stone]], who had 
a curiosity to see how clams were dug; the ground for about 
12 rods nearer shore was several feet lower than the point 
we were on, we were so busily engaged we did not observe 
the flowing tide until we were surrounded by water, and 
having no boat, our only alternative was to wade ashore 
and carry the women, which we safely accomplished amid the 
relection that tide nor time waited for no man.

April 4, Mr. Kent, the post master, showed me a letter 
containing two sheets of foolscap signed by [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] and several
of the Twelve, who had apostatized and been cut off from the church, 
the communication was full of slander and falsehoods against Joseph 
Smith and the Prophet and all that stood by him; it was sent

which were caught in great numbers with by the poeple standing upon 
the wharf.

While standing upon the farm of [[Ebenezer Carver|Eleazur Carven^er^]] on the 
[[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|north island]] I counted fifty five islands, many of which were 
inhabited.

Oct. 2nd, I left the island with Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]], Cap. [[Justus Ames|Ames]] took 
us to [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomastown]] in a sloop.

preached to an attentive congregation, and left ^leaving^ them the book of 
mormon which they promised to read, and ^I^ returned on the 16th.,

I continued by labors during the winter of 1837â8,
and nearly every person had attended my meetings, and taken sides 
for, or against. Our enemies made attempts to break up our 
meetings.

Jan. 15, 1838 a company of sailors belonging to the united 
states revenue cutter, brought on shore a swivel and joined the 
mob, parading near the house where I was preaching, and discharged 
it several times, followed by ^accompanied with^ small arms, with the intention of 
breaking up the meeting; some of the mob gathered around
had rejected the truth, and they would see signs, but not unto 
salvation.

[[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]] includes both [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North]] and [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Fox Island]] is 
in Lat. 44Â°, Long 69Â° 10 '. The inhabitants are generally healthy, 
industrious and hospitable to strangers, the people obtain most of 
their wealth and living by fishing, and fit out annually over one 
hundred licensed vessels, beside many smaller crafts. The north
Island is 9 miles long and 2 wide; population 800, a post office, 
a store, a grist mill, 4 school houses, and a small branch of the
baptist church; the land is rather rocky and rough, yet there are 
many good farms which produce good wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and 
grass; the principal timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and birch,
rasp and goose berry grow in great abundance, sheep are the 
principal stock.

South Fox island comes as near being without any form
as anthing I ever saw, and it would be difficult for a historian 
to give a description of it, it is about 10 miles long and 5 
wide, and is one universal ^a^ mass of rocks, much of it ^principally^ granite,
formed into shelves, hills, hollows, and cut up into nooks, ^nooks^ points
and canons ^ravines.^ to make room for the ^by^ coves and harbors, which run through
and through the island, population 1,000.

I do not recollect of ever seeing a horse on either itsland,
there are some small patches ^of land^ under cultivation, but it is at the
expense of great labor and toil,.  Many ^resident^ fish^ermen,^ ^fish^ at [[Newfoundland|New Foundland]], 
^&^ bring their fish ^them^ home, and dry them upon flakes; they annually 
supply the market with a great amount of codfish, mackerel and 
boxed herring. The latter island contains two stores, three tide saw 
mills, 6 school houses, a small branch of the Methodist church and 
a priest. The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and birch, 
also gooseberries, raspberries, and whortleberries and upland cranberries; bushes
and timber grow in a great measure out of the crevices of the rocks.

There is a great amount and variety of fish in the waters 
coves and harbors around these islands, such as ^vizt:â^ whale, black fish, 
shark, ground shark, pilot fish, horse mackarel, sturgeon, salmon, 
Holloboat cod, Pollock, tom cod, hake, haddock, mackarel, shad
we would like to speak, I told him at 5, he gave out our appoint-
ment, and invited us to his house, I asked him how many school 
houses there were on the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|island]], he answered said, four, and gave me 
their names, I asked him if they were free for any one to preach 
in, he answered in the affirmative; I took out my bible, book of 
Mormon, and doctrine and covenants and laid them all upon his 
stand, he promised to read them.; the hour of meeting arrived,  
I preached to a full house upon the first principles of the Gospel, 
and bore testimony that the Lord had raised up a prophet, and 
had commenced to establish his church and kingdom again upon 
the earth, in fulfilment of the ^His^ word of God as spoken through 
the ancient prophets and apostles; this was the first discourse 
ever delivered by any latter-day Saints upon this chain of [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]]; 
Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] bore testimony. I gave out appointments for preaching in 
the four school houses, the people came out en masse to investigate 
the principles which we taught, in 14 days we preached 19 discourses,
when Cap. [[Justus Ames|Justice Ames]] and [[Betsey Hudson Ames|wife]] were baptized by Elder Hale, Elder 
[[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], the baptist minister, with his family, attended twelve of our 
meetings, read the books, and was convinced by the spirit of the Lord 
that our doctrine was true, and he had a hard struggle for days in
his mind to know which to do, receive, or reject it, he finally resolved 
to reject it, and took a stand against us, he & commenced preaching 
against us, he also sent for Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglass]], the Methodist Minister, on 
the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]], to come over and ^&^ help him; he had been long at 
variance with Mr. Douglass, but they became ^very^ friendly and united in 
a war against us;. We continued preaching daily until be we baptized 
most of the members of Mr. Newton's church, and those who owned 
the meeting house.

I followed Mr. Douglass home to his own island, and com-
menced preaching to his church, and baptized a good share of 
his members;, among whom were several sea Captains. Ministers from 
the main land were sent for, who came over and tryed to put
a stop to the work by preaching and lying about us; but the 
work continued to roll on, they wished me to work a miracle 
to convince them that my doctrine was true, I told them they
and Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]], at his Fathers house; I spent several 
days in preaching to the Saints in that region.

Lord and prayed that he would open our way, the spirit of the 
Lord rested upon us, and testified unto us that our prayers would 
be answered; as we arose from our knees a sloop came into the 
harbor, we went to the Captain and enquired where he was 
going, he replied, through the channel of [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|vinal Haven]]; he took

Deacon and told him I wished him to inform the minister that 
we were servants of God and wished to deliver a message to that 
people, the ^minister^ sent word for us to come into the pulpit, accordingly with 
valize in hand, we walked up into the pulpit, and took a seat on 
each side of him, when he closed his discourse, he asked me what hour
college Jesus Christ and his Apostles obtained their education 
in, : the priest and rabble then left me.

Zion and her stakes may be redeemed and established, no more 
to be thrown down, he said, that the kings of the earth 
would yet become to behold the glory of Zion, and that 
great and glorious blessings would be bestowed upon the Saints 
in the last days. [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] bore testimony, and was followed 
by [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]], who exhorted the Elders to keep within the 
bounds of their knowledge, and let the great mysteries of the
kingdom alone, for the Gentiles had not a knowledge even 
of the first principles of the Gospel, ^he said^ it It is far better to 
preach what the people would call the small things of the 
kingdom, than to enter with the visions of Isaiah, Ezekiel 
and John. The twelve broke bread which was distributed 
to the multitude, who eat and were filled, thanks wereas returned 
and the meeting closed at the setting of the sun. Â¶ The house 
was again filled at candle light, Prest. Smith requested the Elders

spirit. April

April 9, Prest. Smith spoke in the afternoon, and 
said in the name of the Lord that His ^the^ judgments ^of God^ would 
rest upon those men who had professed to be his friends 
and friends of humanity, and in building up Kirtland, a 
stake of Zion; but had turned traitors to him, and the 
interests of the kingdom of God, and had given power
until they were darkened in their minds and many were 
opposed to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], and some wished to appoint [[David Whitmer|David Whitmer]]
to lead the church in his stead; in the midst of this cloud 
of dark spirits, Joseph returned to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and this morning
arose in the stand, when he appeared as though he was
much depressed, but soon the spirit of God rested upon hism
men and he addressed the assembly in great plainness for
about 3 hours, and put his enemies to silence. when he arose
he said, "I am still the President,â prophet, seer, Revelator
and leader of the church of Jesus Christ, and kingdom God
and not not man has appointed and placed me in this 
position, and no man or set of men have power to remove
me or appoint another in my stead, and those who undertake
this, if they do not speedily repent, they will ^burn their fingers &^ go to hell.
He reproved the people sharply for their sins, darkness and
unbelief, the power of God rested upon him, and bore testimony
that his sayings were true.

Prest. Joseph Smith had been absent on business for the church,
but not half as long as Moses was in the mount away from
Israel, yet many of the people in Kirtland, if they did not
make a calf to worship as did the Israelites, they turned  
their hearts away from the Lord and from His servant Joseph,
and had engaged in speculation and given away to false spirits
119 members; [[Johnston F. Lane|Johnson F. Lane]], [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benj. L. Clapp]] and Randolph 
Alexander were ordained Elders, and [[Lindsey Anderson Brady|Lindsey Bradey]] to the office
of  a priest by [[David Wyman Patten|D. W. Patten]], who baptized five at the 
close of the conference.

ISD At this conference I was released from my labors in 
the South, and counselled to go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] and receive my 
endowments, as was also [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]]

Sep. 19, I parted Elders [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Marsh]] and D. W. Patten and wife 
and [[Elisha Hurd Groves|E. H. Groves]] started for [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]]. I organized the 
first company of Saints who emigrated from the Southern states,
which numbered 22 souls.

I appointed Elder [[Benjamin Boydston|Boydston]] Prest. of the Coy. and counselled 
them to be united, and to remember their prayers night and 
day before the Lord.

20,th, the camp started. I spent a few days visiting 
the branches, baptized and confirmed 8, and obtained 30 subscribers for 
the Messenger and Advocate.

Oct. 20th, In company with A. O. Smoot & [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpin]] 
I started for Kirtland; this was the first time I had ever 
travelled on a steam boat, we left the steamer at [[Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky|Louisville]] on 
the 28th, and spent 19 days visiting Elder Smoots relations and preach-
ing among the people; we visited the [[Big Bone Lick, Boone County, Kentucky|big bone lick]];
we arrived in [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnatti]] Nov. 17, where we saw thirteen persons 
dead and wounded taken from the Steamer Flora ^which had burst her pipes while running a race^; arrived in 
Kirtland on the 25th, and had the happy privilege of meeting 
the prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], and many Elders, with whom I was acquainted 
in the camp of Zion. 29th, I heard Joseph preach in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]]. 
In the afternoon I was called to speak and read the 56 chap. of
Isaiah, and made some remarks upon it, and gave an account 
of my mission in the South; Elder Smoot also addressed the Saints.

I was counselled by the Presidency to attend the school
in the Temple taught by Prof. [[H. M. Hawes|Haws]], I studdied the Latin language 
and English Grammar, and boarded with bro. [[Ira Bond|Ira Bond]].

I attended meetnigs with the Seventies and other Quorums 
during the winter of 1836â7, and recieved much valuable instruction
any kind of doctrine, no matter how false, the 
people will swallow it down, but let a stranger come 
and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which will save
the people, as Mr. Woodruff has done, and the people 
are afraid of him.

Mr. [[Randolph Alexander|Alexander]] invited me home, bought a book 
of Mormon, and was soon baptized, and several others followed 
his example.

I.SD July 14, I wrote a letter to [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]], and 
sent him a list of subscribers, and o for the Messenger and 
advocate, and a detail of my mission in the South.

18th, I rode in company with [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] to a 
ferry on the [[Tennessee River, United States|Tennessee river]]; there ferryman was absent, we 
were offered the use of the boat, & ferried ourselves, but 
not being much used to the business, and loosing one oar 
in the river, and having to row with one ^a^ broken oar, we 
landed a great distance below the usual place with a 
high circulation of blood and blistered hands, but our horses
leapt the bank and we went on our way to the [[Sandy River, Tennessee|Sandy]], 
which we swam and spent the night at [[Thomas Frazier|Thomas Frazer's]]

30th, we rode to ^preached at^ Mr. [[David Crider|David Crider's]],  and preached
at his house, also on Sunday the 31st, ^where^ we were threatened 
with ^by^ a mob; I baptized Mr. Crider amid the scoffs of
the rabble, they did not mob us, but ^who^ went in the night 
and poisoned both of our horses, the one which I rode
belonging to bro. [[Samuel Walker West|Samuel West]], which died in 2 days afterwards,
brother Smoot's recovedred, the hogs ^swine^ which ^that^ eat of the horse
flesh also died.

Augt. 11 I met with [[David Wyman Patten|D. W. Patten]] and his 
[[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|wife]]; he and bro. [[Warren Farr Parrish|Parrish]] had been driven out of [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton]] into 
[[Henry County, Tennessee|Henry Co.]] and Elder Parrish had left for [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]

29th. We were visited by Elders [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|T. B. Marsh]] 
and [[Elisha Hurd Groves|E. H. Groves]], from [[Caldwell County, Missouri|Caldwell Co.]] Mo. and

Sep. 2, We held a conference at [[Damon Creek, Calloway County, Kentucky|Damon's creek]] 
Callaway Co., Kentucky; several branches were represented, containing
were baptized should receive the Holy Ghost in 24 hours, 
and that Christ should come the second time before this gen-
eration passed away; the whole concern was a mob mock 
trial, contrary to law, justice, judgment or truth.

On the 29th, I went to a baptist meeting house on 
[[Thompson Creek, Weakley County, Tennessee|Thompsons creek]], to ^preach^ fulfil an previous appointment; the 
house was crowded with people, as I rose to speak in the
pulpit a baptist priest, Mr. Browning, arrived at the door 
on horseback, & stepped in greatly agitated, and told the Deacon 
to forbid my preaching in the house, at the sametime
commenced a tirade of abuse against the Mormons, telling 
several lies, which I corrected before the people, which 
increased his rage; as I was forbidden to preach in the 
house, and had been invited, and travelled many miles 
to fulfil my appointment, ^I told the people^ I would like to preach & 
was willing to stand on a wood pile, a fence; a cart, 
or any place, they would appoint; a man rose and said 
he owned the land in front of the meeting house, and 
I might stand & preach on that, and welcome, all the 
congregation with the exception of the minister and one Deacon
arose and left the house, walked across the street & 
formed seats of a worm fence, and gave good attention 
while I preached for an hour and a half on the principles 
of the Gospel; when I closed I gave liberty for any 
one to speak. Mr. [[Randolph Alexander|Randolph Alexander]] rose and 
made a few remarks, it being the first time he
^who^ had ^never^ heard a Mormon Elder speak ^before^, he said, the 
people of the present day made him think of a 
pen of hogs, the keeper would make a trough, and 
pour into it anything, hot 
or cold water, dish water or anything else, ^and they would drink it,^, but let a 
stranger come along and pour over a ba^s^ket of corn on 
the back side of the pen, & the hogs would be frightened 
and run and snort all over the pen; he said, it was 
so with the people, the priests would feed them with
izing new branches, & holding conferences. &c.
Feby. 26, 1836, at a conference held at bro. [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|B. L. Clapp's]] 
in [[Calloway County, Kentucky|Callaway Co.]], Ky., I ordained [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] & [[Benjamin Boydston|Benj. Boydston]] 
E^e^lders and B. L. Clapp & [[Daniel Thomas|Dan. Thomas]] priests.

Bros. Smoot & Clapp both entered into the labors of 
the ministry. Elder Smoot frequently accompanied me on 
my mission. Elder [[David Wyman Patten|D. W. Patten]] returned to [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in april, 
and joined us in our labors, accompanied by his [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|wife]], it was 
a happy meeting, he related to me the blessings he had received 
in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] during the endowments; we travelled and labored 
together; persecution raged against us; Elder Patten bore a 
strong and forcible testimony unt of ^to^ ^of^ the work of God, and when 
we were opposed by mobs he would rebuke them in great 
plainness; we were threatened, but not injured; the sick 
were frequently healed under our administrations.

May 27, Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] joined us, he came direct
^arrived^ from Kirtland and joined us in our labors.  We held a conference 
on the 28th, at bro. [[Seth Utley|Seth Utleys]]; 7 branches were represented con-
taining 116 members. [[Abel B. Wilson|Abel Wilson]] and [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpin]] ^were^ ordained priests 
and [[Albert Petty|Albert Petty]] ordained a Teacher. 31st, I was ordained 
under the hands of ^by^ David W. Patten a member of the second 
quorum of Seventies. We

We continued to extended our laborsed over a circuit of 
several hundred miles, bro. Smoot labored continually with us and 
bro. Clapp frequently. We travelled two by two, only as ^except when^ we
^&^ all met together to hold conferences.

June 19, a states warrant was issued against
D. W. Patten, Warren Parrish & Wilford Woodruff, sworn out 
by [[Matthew Williams|Mathew Williams]], a Methodist priest, and served by the 
Sheriff, [[Robert Cowan Petty|Robert C. Petty]].  Elders Patten and Parrish were 
taken by an armed mob of about fifty, under ^pretence^ form ^color^ of law
led by the Sheriff, a Colonel, 1st & 2nd major, with other 
officers, and a Methodist priest, with a gun on his shoulder 
I was in another County and not taken.  We were accused 
of prophecying falsely, by saying, that four persons who
remain and take charge of the Southern churches, and the Lord 
would bless me in so doing.

June 28, [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] ordained me to the office
of an Elder, we baptized some 40 persons while laboring together.

July 23, Elder Parrish returned to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] ^left^.  I continued
to traveled alone through the year, and extended my labors both in 
[[Kentucky|Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]]. I baptized 43 persons during this 
season, 31 after bro. Parrish left me.

Nov. 15, while travelling in the night with several
bro. [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benj. L. Clapp]] and others, a tremendous storm of wind 
and rain overtook us; we came to a creek which had swollen to 
such an extent by the rain that we could not cross without 
swimming our horses; and several of the company were faemialies, and 
could not consistently cross the stream / we undertook to head the 
stream sufficient to ford it, but in the attempt in the midst 
of the darkness, and the raging of the wind and rain, we became ^were^
lost in the thick woods,we had neither fire, light nor road, but 
were in the dark, mud, ^amidst the^ rain, wind, mud, creeks and ^fallen^ tree tops,
we crossed streams near twenty times, and setting aside our females
and horses we made more the appearance of fishermen than 
travellers. I was reminded of Pauls perils by water; but the 
Lord was merciful unto us in the midst of our troubles, for 
while we were groping in the dark, running the risk of killing 
both ourselves and animals by riding off  steep ^precipitous^ bluffs, a bright light 
suddenly shone round about us, and revealed unto us our perilous 
situation, as we were upon the edge of a deep gulf; the light 
continued with us until we found a house and learned the 
right road, then the light disappeared, yet ^&^ we were enabled 
to reach the house of bro. [[Henry Thomas|Henry Thomas]] at 9 o'clock in the 
evening, without all safe, having rode 20 miles, being 5 hours in
the storm, and forded streams twenty or more times, and we felt 
to thank the Lord for our preservation.

During the winter and spring, I continued to labor mostly 
alone, through Kentucky and Tennessee, and extended my labors
opening new places, preaching daily, baptizing, confirming and organ-
On the 24th, while in the swamps, I had an attack
of the Rheumatizm and could not travel fast.

My companion, bro. [[Henry Brown|Brown]], had got in a hurry, and wished 
to hasten to the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]], close up his mission, take boat and
return to his family in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and as I could not travel 
as fast as he wished, we parted; he left me sitting on a log in 
the mud and water; I was lame and unable to walk, without food, 
and 12 miles from the nearest house on the road; he went out of 
sight in great haste; I then knelt down in the water and prayed 
to the Lord to heal me; the spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and 
I was healed; the pain left me, I arose and went my way; whenever 
I met with one or more families I preached and bore testimony 
to them as I went along. ^Â¶^ I crossed the Mississippi river on the
evening of the 27th, of March.

I ^&^ staid at a public house kept by Mr. [[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]], 
I was suspected of being an imposter. Mr. Jackson believed I was 
one of Murrill's clan, who were then murdering and stealing N^n^egros; 
and to test me, he gathered together a large house full of the ^most^ wickedest,
and most corrupt Gentlemen ^people^ in the city, and set me to preaching 
to them, to see whether I could preach or not.

I do not think that Mr. Jackson or the same company 
of men and women will ever meet together again for the same 
purpose; or to test for they would not like again to have their 
sins and abominations revealed to each other, as plainly and pointedly
as I told them that night, through the inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost:  they were glad to get rid of me upon almost any terms.

I travelled from [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]] to middle Tennessee.

April 4, I met with Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] in Benton 
Co., Hime and [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]] had labored together through the 
winter in Tennessee, and baptized 20 persons. Elder Patten had 
returned to Kirtland.  I joined Elder Parrish and we labored 
together over 3 months, travelling and preaching daily, baptizing such 
as would receive our testimony, extending our labors through ^in^ Tennessee & Ken-
tucky.

June 23, we recieved a letter from [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]],  saying,
that they wished ^requesting^ Elder Parrish to come to Kirtland, and for me to
lightning; [[Alexander Akeman|he]] swelled & ^immediately^ turned black; this created a great wailing 
and mourning among his family. Brother [[Henry Brown|Brown]] and myself assisted 
in laying him out, and burying him; he died Feby. 14th, 1835, and 
we buried him on the 16th.,

This singular dispensation of providence brought solemnity 
upon the people, and they began to reflect and wished to heare
preaching; we held several meetings and preached to the people, and
baptized Mr. [[Jonathan Hubbel|Hubbel]] and his [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|wife]], aged people ^persons^, who had opened their 
doors, and given us a home; and just as we had got the people 
prepared to receive the Gospel, and anxious to learn and pleading with 
us to stay and preach, bro. Brown resolved that he would continue 
his journey south.  I was fully satisfied that should we stop, we would
build up a church, and was convinced it was our duty to stop 
but bro. Brown held the office of an Elder ^& I submitted^ and I was a Priest, we 
were travelling together upon a mission, and I felt that I must be 
subject to those over me in the priesthood, so I submitted.

This is an error which many have committed in this church 
who were sent as Missionaries to the world, as soon as they got doors
open and a people prepared to receive the Gospel, they go away and 
leave them: we left this people with tears in their eyes. Brother 
Brown did not baptize another person ^on the mission^ during his whole southern
mission.
March 2, we cut down a large cotton wood tree, and ^in â two days^ dug out 
a canoe 4 feet wide & 12 feet long, put on a pair of oars and ^then^ rowed
down the [[Arkansas River, United States|Arkansas river]], 125 miles, to [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|little Rock]], begging our food 
by the way, a meal at a time, as we had opportunity; after visiting 
little Rock we travelled down the river 10 miles, and tied up our 
canoe on the east bank and stopped with Mr. Jones, I preached 
next day at his house. On the 16th, we left our canoe with Mr. Jones 
and walked back up the river 10 miles, opposite little Rock, and took 
the old military road, and started to wade the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]] swamp 
which was mostly covered with water from little Rock, Arkansas, to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], 
Tennessee, a distance of about 175 miles. We waded through mud and 
water knee deep, day after day, and in some instances 40 miles per day,
before we could get a stopping place.
followed by Elder [[Henry Brown|Brown]]: during our preaching there was a hard snow 
storm.

We arrived at [[Petit Jean River, Arkansas Territory|Petty John Creek]], in the Arkansas Territory, where 
Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Alexander Akeman]] resided with a large family of sons and one
daughter, all of which who^m^ were settled around him, Mr Akeman, ^stet^ was a
member of the church ^he^ and a part of his family, were members of the 
church in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson Co.]]; his wife died strong in the faith in Mo.; & his 
whole family were mobbed, and some of his sons were whipped severely; 
but he could not stand the persecution and the loss of his property,
he moved to Arkansas to get rid of Mormonism, had apostatized, and 
was bitter against the work; when we called upon him, he opposed 
us strongly, â spoke against the leaders of the church and the book of 
Mormon, he had one son who received us, and had a little faith, I 
had a ^the following^ dreamed the night before I ^we^ went there. concerning what we should
meet with, and what would transpire. " I dreamed that we were re-
quired to walk in a strai^gh^t narrow path, and while following the path 
it lead to the door of a house, which was placed in a high wall which ^that^ we 
could not get around; as I opened the door to go through, I saw the
room ^was^ filled with ^large serpents.^ snakes, I proceeded ^entered,^ and they all coiled up to jump 
at me; as they made a spring to bite me, they all fell dead at my 
feet, turned black, swelled up, burst open, took fire and were consumed 
before my eyes.

We met with much opposition not only by ^from^ Mr. Akeman 
but from ^&^ many in the neighborhood, Elder Brown wished to leave 
the place immediately; I told him I should stay and see my dream 
fulfilled. We staid in the neighborhood 25 days, during which time,
the Lord brought judgment upon those who threatened to mob ^& kill^ us; 
many of them died suddenly, while we were there, and I was 
warned three times by the Lord to go to Mr. Akeman and bear 
testimony unto him of the truth of Mormonism and the wickedness 
of his course in opposing it, and the last time I called upon him 
he was filled with wrath against me, and when I left his house 
he followed me in a rage, apparently with some evil intent; when I 
had got a few rods from his door, he was nearly treading on my 
heels, he ^&^ fell dead at my feet, as though he had been struck with
and three young dogs, he lay stretched out upon the bare
floor with his feet to a small fire, there was no door to the
house, but a ragged quilt hung up in the door way; it was 
past 11 o'clock at night. I turned away the quilt, looked into
the house, every thing was in sound sleep,  I ^&^ spoke three
times; no one stirred, not even a dog. I walked in and laid
my hands upon the man's shoulders, and spoke to him; the moment
he felt the weight of my hand, he leaped to his feet, and commenced
running around the room, leaping as high as he could each jump.
I told him not to be frightened, as we were travellers and friends
and did not wish to hurt him, but wished to stop with him
over night; when he came to his senses, he gave us permission to
stop with him till morning, if we would take the bare floor,
as he did, we asked for something to eat, as we had walked 60
miles without a morsel of food; he replied, he had nothing for us,
and assured us he had to kill game for his breakfast in the
morning. He informed us that the reason of his fright, was ^ in 
consequence of his having shot a large panther dead a few nights
previous standing in his door, and he thought his mate had
lit upon him. We lay down upon the floor, and we were
glad of this place as it soon began to rain, and rained
through the night.

In the morning we arose, and went on in the rain 12
miles to a Mr. [[Mr. Connor|Conner's]], who was also in the [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson county]] mob;
he gave us breakfast, but damned us while we were eating because
we were Mormons, when we had finished f a hearty breakfast, we thanked
him very politely, and went on our way leaving him swearing; we
felt thankful for breakfast, for we had walked 72 miles without
eating food. We continued travelging, preaching by the way, without ^taught from house to house^ 
stopping, only over night. as we journeyed.

Jan. 24, I preached at Mr. [[Nathan Tanner|Nathan Tanner's]] in [[Greene County, Missouri|Green Co]].
Missouri, the first time we had found a congregation during our
journey, that we could converse, and preach to, in safety, and the first
time that I had ever attempted to preach ^as a missionary.^ to a congregation in the
capacity of a Priest or missionary, I had great liberty and was
and entertained for the remainder of the night by Mr. [[Michael Geraud|Jerrew]],
who had an Osage squaw for a wife; she prepared us a good
supper, but marvelled that we did not drink coffee; she pro-
ffered us their best bed, which was highly ornamented, but we de-
clined ^ her accepting her kind offer, as we were wet and muddy;
she then made us a good bed of Mackinaw blankets before a
large fire, and we slept comfortably. May the Lord reward
both Mr. Jerrew and wife, and the Presbyterian minister accord-
ing to their deserts.
19th, Mr. Jerreu gave us a good breakfast, put us accross
the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage river]] in a canoe, and was we started upon our long
day's walk, it being 60 miles to the nearest house; and we had not
a morsel of anything with us to eat; most of our travels through
the day was through prairie; before dark we entered timbered land,
as we approached the timber a large black bear met us; we
had no weapons^.^ but a small pistol, when the bear got ^within^ about
6 rods of us, he rose upon his hind feet and examined us
a short time, then turned and went another off. We were
soon enveloped in such thick darkness ^that^ it was with great difficulty
that we could keep the road, we ^&^ were soon surrounded with ^by^
a large drove of wolves, that ^which^ kept up a continual howling, and
would frequently rush upon us, coming to within a few feet
of us, we travelled about two hours in this situation, feeling that
we were in danger, and concluded to stop and build a fire
and wait till morning; accordingly we built a large fire which
drove the wolves off, and as we were about to lie down, we heard
a dog bark and a bell; we felt assured we were near a
house; each both of us took a brand of fire, and on going
about one quarter of a mile, we came to a log hut, which was
occupied by Mr. Williams, who had been in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson Co.]], during
the mobing of the Saints;, he ^&^ had lately moved here depending
upon his gun mostly for his living, it was 60 miles to a 
house on the North and 12 miles on the South; him ^He^ and his
family were living in a small old log hut, about 12 feet square,
and one bed in the room, upon which lay his wife, several children[[Lyman Wight|Wight]], I certifying that I had faithfully performed my duties in Zions'
camp. I took my
On this day I took my valise in hand, weighing 15 lbs., mostly
books of Mormon, and started in company with Elder [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]],
we ^&^ crossed the river into [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson Co.]], and bowed our knees felt thankful.
to God; we bowed our knees, and prayed that God "might protect
us from the mob while going through the country, and that His
judgements might rest upon the wicked who had shed the blood
of the Saints in that land, that the land might be cleansed from
sin. I bore ^had^ a, Petition to the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Governor]] of Mo., for redress of
wrongs perpetrated upon us in Jackson Co., for the purpose of obtaining
signatures unto it. We bent our way south, through Jackson Co., without
any harm molestation; yet, in one instance, we were miraculously
preserved from a mob of about 60, assembled at a grog shop,
which we had to pass.
June 18, we called at the [[Harmony Mission, Bates County, Missouri|Harmony mission]] and had an
interview with the President, a Presbyterian minister; althoug^h it^ was near
sun down he would neither give us any thing to eat, nor lodge us,
because we were Mormons, it was 15 miles to the nearest house,
which was [[Michael Geraud|Jerrews]] Indian tready trading house; we asked the
minister to direct us there; he gave us directions, but the spirit
said to me, he was deceiving us, I asked him three times, and
he declared he was telling us the truth. ) We followed his directions
and we arrived ^came^ at ^to^ the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage river]] swamp, where we were lost
in the darkness of the night; we followed the river, but as it is
one of the most ^very^ crooked in America, we made ^but^ little progress. After
travelling through mud and and water for one hour, we concluded
to go out on the open prairie and lie down in the grass until
morning, but when we got out into the prairie we heard the
Osage Indians drum and shout at the trading house as they were
having a Pow-wow, we followed by the sound and went into
their midst; As we approached, we were met by a dozen large
savage looking dogs; they smelt us in a friendly manner, but
did not attempt to bite nor bark; we arrived about midnight,
covered with mud, hungry and weary, and were kindly receivedfollowing winter.
I had a great desire to t^pr^each the Gospel, which I did not
reveal to any person ^name to my brethren^, but one Sunday evening I retired into the woods
alone, and called upon the Lord in earnest prayer to open my way
to go and preach the Gospel to the inhabitants of the Earth; the
spirit of the Lord rested upon me and bore witness unto me 
that my prayer was heard, and should be answered. I walked
arose from my knees happy, and walked some forty rods through a
thick wood into an open road, as I entered the road, there stood before
^&^ me^t^ [[Elias Higbee|Elias Higbee]], a high priest, with whom I had staid for a number
of months, but had never said any thing to me about preaching or
ordination, but now as I appouched^roached^ him, he said "bro. Wilford the
spirit of the Lord tells me that you should be ordained and
go on a mission." I replied, "I am ready."
At a meeting of the High Council at [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight's]], 
[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay Co.]], Mo. on Nov. 5, I was ordained a priest ^by Elder^ under the hands of 
bros. [[Simeon Dagget Carter|Samuel^imeon^ Carter]]; [[Stephen Winchester|Stephen Winchester]] and [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman T. Hyde]], were ^also^ ordained
Priests at the same time.
Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] said he would like to have me go into
the Southern States, through [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] & [[Kentucky|Kentucky]], &c. ^&^ if I could
find any body who had faith enough to go with me ^to take^ for it would
be a dangerous count^r^y to travel in at present, in consequence of the 
Missouri persecution, ^to take him.^ I told him I was as ready to go South as any
where, and asked if I should go through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], as it lay direct
on our route, he said ^replied^, it would be at the risk of life, and he
had not got faith enough to undertake it; if I had, I might
try it. I also asked him, if I went through Jackson Co., if I
should start without purse or scrip according to the law of God,
Hee he replied answered, that he had not got faith enough to start
on a mission through Jackson Co., without money, and if I did it
I must do it on my own faith, I felt strenuous to keep the
commandments, so I started without money; I called upon Elder Harry
Brown, and asked him if he would not ^to^ accompany me; it met ^he consented,^
his wishes, and Bishop Partridge gave appointed him to go with me
Jan. 13, 1835, I received an honorable discharge from Lyman: we had a precious time. He was upon an important mission to
gather up a company to go up to redeem Zion. I accompanied brother
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Pratt]] to [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson Co.]], ^&^ I told him my circumstances; he said it was my
duty to prepare myself to go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and join the camp of Zion.
I immediately went to work with all my might and settled
my business. Â¶ April 11, 1834, I ^with my^ biad^e^ my friends farewell, and took a pair
of horses and wagon, and took with me ^I took^ brothers [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]] and
[[Warren Ingles|Warren Ingales]], and started for Kirtland, Ohio ^Zion^. I met with [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]],
[[John M. Murdock|John Murdoch]] and other Elders on the way and arrived in Kirtland
on the 25th day of April 1834.
I was introduced to The prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], who invited me
to make his house my home; which kind offer I accepted, ^his offer^ and staid
with him about one week. I became acquainted not only with the
prophet Joseph, and his family but / with ^stet^ many of the High Priests
Elders and Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland and heard many
of the Elders speak, and I felt to rejoice before God for the light and
knowledge which was manifested to me during that day.
May 1, I started from Kirtland, and went to [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]],
and remained till all the company joined us, when we were organized.
^Â¶^ March 7, we took up our line of march, pitching our tents by the
way, and travelled to [[Missouri|Missouri]].
After we had pitched our tents in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay Co.]] (our numbers being
205) and many of the brethren had been taken sick, and some had
died, Joseph requested the camp to disperse, except enough to take care
of the sick; all who had teams were required to leave the ground
go among the brethren, I went to bro. [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wights']], in company
with [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]] and [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. After Shortly, Joseph called
the brethren together at Lyman Wights', and told them if they would
humble themselves before the Lord, and covenant to keep His command-
ments and obey His counsel, the plague should be stayed from that
hour, and there should not be another case of the cholera in the
camp. The brethren commanded covenanted to do this and the
plague was stayed and there was not another case in camp.
Prest. Joseph Smith returned home ^to Kirtland^ with many other of the 
brethren, I remained with Lyman Wight, laboring with my hands till thewhen [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|we]] met, we both told our impressions, and it caused us 
to wonder and marvel and wonder, what the Lord wanted of 
us in [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]; but as we had made preparations 
to move to the West, we let outward circumstances control us,
and Jonah-like, instead of going to Rhode Island, we went 
to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego Co., New York, and there remained until 
the 29th day of Dec., ^29,^ 1833, before ^when^ I heard Elder [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsiper]] 
and [[Elijah Cheney|Elijah Cheeny]] preach. My brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] and I believed 
their testimony, and invited ^entertained^ the Elders home and offered our-
selves for baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the 
book of Mormon and I received a testimony that it was 
true.

I learned that Elders [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Sam. H. Smith]] and [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] were
had preached in Rhode island in 1832, which accounted for the
reason We soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode 
Island, for at the time we were warned of the Lord to go there, 
two of the Elders of the Latter day Saints were preaching there,
and had we gone, we certainly should have embraced the 
work at that time, but as it was we had to wait for
the next call.

Dec. 31, I was baptized by Elder Zerah Pulsipher; and ^he^ 
confirmed ^me^ the same evening.

Jan. 2, 1834 I was ordained to the office of a Teacher,
and my Eldest brother, Azmon, an Elder, and a small branch organized 
of 12 members by Elder Pulsipher.

In Feby. following, in company with Elder Holton, I walked 
some 60 miles to the town of [[Fabius, Onondaga County, New York|Fabius]] to attend an evening meeting 
of the saints in that place where Elder Pulsipher was presiding; I 
saw the book of commandments or revelations given through [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], 
and I believed them with all my heart and rejoiced therein, and after 
spending several days with them, and holding several meetings, we returned 
home rejoicing. Â¶ During the winter, we were visited by several of the 
Elders among whom was Elder [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]]; He again who called
upon us again about Feby 1st, accompanied by Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] 
called upon us and instructed the branch, he spoke till near midnight
subjects, although I never made an ^outward^ profession until 1830; I did 
not then join any church, for the reason that I could not find 
any denomination whose doctrines, faith or practice, agreed with 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordinances and gifts which the 
Apostles taught.  Although the ministers of the day taught that 
the faith, gifts, graces, miracles ^& ordinances,^ which the ancient saints enjoyed 
were done away and no longer needed, I did not believe a word of
it, to be true, only as they were done away through the unbelief of
the children of men; I believed the same gifts, graces, miracles and 
power would be manifest in one age of the world as in another,
when God had a church upon the earth, & I believed ^that^ the church 
of God would be ^re-^established upon the earth, in my and that 
I should live to see it.  Thies^e^ principles was^ere^ rivetted upon my 
mind from two causes; first, from the perusal of the old and 
new Testament, with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me 
what was right and wrong, and lead me in the path of salva-
tion, without any regard to the opinions of man, and the 
whisperings of the spirit of the Lord for the space of three years 
taught me in accordance with the written word of God that 
He was about to set up His church and kingdom upon the 
earth in the last days. / and secondly, I was taught thies^e^ 
principle ^things^ from my youth by [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], an aged man,
who lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]], Conn.; who was frequently called the old 
prophet Mason,: he taught me many things which are now
coming to pass. / he

He did not believe that any person man upon the
face of the earth had authority to administer in the ordinances
of the Gospel, but believed it was our privilege through faith, prayer 
and fasting to heal the sick, and cast out Devils by the laying on 
of hands, which was the case under his administration as many 
could testify.

I was looking for the coming forth of the truth when I
heard of what was called Mormonism.  In 1832 I was 
inspired to go to [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]], an my brother, [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]], was
also directed by the spirit of God to go to the same place
26 years, leaving me 15 months old. My [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father's]] married for
his second wife, [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Azup^b^ah Hart]], was born July, 31, 1792; they were
married Nov., 9, 1810; and ^they^ had six children,. vizt.:â [[Philo Woodruff|Philo]] born
Nov., 29, 1811;, and died by poison administered by a physician Nov.,
25, 1827; aged 16 years; [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahil Hart]] born April, 11, 1814, and
died in [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terrahaute]], Oct., 18, 1838; aged 24 [[Franklin Woodruff|Franklin]] born March
12, 1816, and died June 1, 1816; [[Newton Woodruff, b. 1818|Newton]] born June 19, 1818,
drowned Sep. 1820; [[Julius Woodruff|Julius]] born April 22, 1820, and died in
infancy; [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] born June 19, 1820^1^. I married her to Dwight
Webster in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Conn. Aug. 4, 1841.

My father, Aphek was a strong constitutioned man, and
has done a great amount of labor. At 18 years of age, he commenced
attending a flouring and saw mill, and continued about [page covered]
[page covered] t of this time he labored 18, in each 24 hours hours a [page covered]

He never made any profession of religion, until [page covered]
him with all his household into the church of Jesus [page covered]

man of great charity, honesty, integrity and truth, and made himself
poor by giving to the poor and accommodating his fellow-men
by loaning money and becoming surety for his neighbors, and 
always saying yes to every man who asked a favor at his hand

I was born in the North part of the town of
Farmington, now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], Hartford Co., Conn. March 1, 1807.
I assisted my Father in attending the Farmington Mills, until I
was 20 years of age. / In the Spring of ^April,^ 1827 I took the flouring
mill of my Aunt, [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen Wheeler]], which I attended three years.
In the Spring of  ^May,^ 1830, I took charge of the flouring mill of Mr.
[[Samuel Collins|Collins]], the ax manufacturer, in [[South Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|south Canton]], Conn., at the end 
of one year it was demolished to make way for other machinery.
In the spring of ^March,^ 1831 I took charge of the flouring mill owned
by Mr. [[Richard B. Cowles|Richd. B. Cowleys]] of [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]], Conn. In the Sp^r^ing ^stet^
of ^stet^ 1832, in company with my oldest brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], I went to
[[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Owego Co., New York, and purchased a farm and saw mill,
and settled down in business for ourselves.

At an early age my mind was exercised upon religious
History of Wilford Woodruff.
(From his own pen)
In tracing the history of my fathers, I find it difficult
to obtain a satisfactory account of the Woodruff family, for more
than three generations.

My ^Great^ Grandfather, [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Woodruff]], lived nearly one hundred
years, of age and possessed an strong iron constitution and performed
a great amount of manual labor nearly up to the time of his
death. His wife's name was [[Sarah Woodford Woodruff|Sarah]]; she bore to him nine
children as follows;â [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1743|Josiah]], [[Appleton Woodruff|Appleton]], [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad]], [[Elisha Woodruff|Elisha]], [[Joseph Woodruff, b. 1752|Joseph]], [[Rhoda Rosetta Woodruff Gridley|Rhoda]],
[[Phoebe Woodruff, b. 1738|Phebe]] and two names not given.

My Grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was the third son of
[page covered] he was born in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Hartford Co., Connecticut
[page covered] heâ father ^also^ possessed a strong constitution; it was said, that
[page covered] d the most labor for several years of any man in
Hartford Co., and from over exertion in hewing timber he was
attacked with rheumatism in his right hip, which caused a severe
lameness, for several years before his death. He married Dinah
Woodford by whom he had seven children as follows, vizt. :â [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1773|Eldad]]
[[Elizabeth Woodruff Frisbie|Elizabeth]], [[Samuel Gridley Woodruff|Samuel]], [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek]], [[Titus Woodruff|Titus]], [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|He-Ellen]] and [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]].

Eldad married [[Lewey Woodford Woodruff|Lewey Woodford]]; Elizabeth, [[Amasa Frisbie|Amasa Frisby]];
Samuel, Miss [[Nancy Case Woodruff|Case]]; Aphek, [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Beulah Thompson]] and Hannah [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|^Azubah^ Hart]]; Titus,
[[Louisa Alling Woodruff|Louisa Allen]]; Hellen, [[Amos Wheeler|Amos Wheeler]]; and Ozem, [[Acksah Merrill Woodruff|Acksah Merrill]] and Hannah
Hart; all of these had numerous families, unions were productive
whom had large families.

My Grandfather died in Farmington, with the spotted fever
in 1806, aged 55 years. My Grandmother, Dinah, Woodruff died in
1824, in the same place, with a cancer in the left breast: her
sufferings were very great.

My Father, Aphek Woodruff, was born in Farmington
Nov. 11, 1778; he married Beulah Thomson, who was born in 1782,
Nov., 29, 1801. She bore to him three children ^sons^, ^namely:â^ [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] born Nov., 29,
1802; [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Ozen Thompson]] born Dec. 22, 1804; myself born March, 1, 1807.

My mother died with the spotted fever, June, 11, 1808, aged
in journeying from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] Ohio to this place has been very faithful
in the discharge of his duty since his arival here both temporally and spiritually
is strong in the faith of the Latter Day Saints and worthy of his calling
He is recommended by the Church in this place to any branch where providence
may call him.  [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]]))

of the night by Mr [[Michael Geraud|Jerew]] the French trader. He had an Osage squaw for a

she offered us their best bed which was highly ornamented and adorned but

us a good bed of Mocasin blankets before a large fire and we slept
comfortably untill morning. May the Lord reward both Mr Jerew & wife &

2nd page 11. ((On the 24th Jan I preached at Mr [[Nathan Turner|Nathan Turners]] in 
[[Greene County, Missouri|Green County]] Missouri it being the first time that we had found a
congregation during our journey that we could get together and preach
to in safety, & the first time that I had ever attempted to, preach the
gospel to a congregation in the capacity of a priest or missionary I had 
good liberty & was followed by Elder [[Henry Brown|Brown]] ther was a hard snow storm
during the time))closely associated having ^and^ lived in the same house for a number
of months but had never to my recollection said any thing to me
about preaching or ordination. But now as I approached him
[[Elias Higbee|he]] said Brother Wilford the Spirit of the Lord tells me that you
should be ordained & go and preach the gospel ^on a mission^. I said very well
if it is the will of the Lord I am ready.
At a meeting of the High Council at [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wights]] [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] Missouri
on the 5th day of Nov 1834 I was ordained to the office of a priest by the
directions of the High Council under the hands of Brother [[Simeon Dagget Carter|Simeon Carter]]
[[Stephen Winchester|Stephen Winchester]] & [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]] were ordained priests at the same time.
I called upon Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]] and asked him what my
mission should be in what part of the country I should go to preach
the gospel. He replyed that I should ^Bishop Partridge said he would^ like to have some of the Brethren ^me^ go into
the Southern States through [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] [[Tennessee|Tennesee]] [[Kentucky|Kentucky]] &c if I could find
any body who had faith enough to go ^with me^ for it would be a hard mission
and a hard ^dangerous^ county to travel in at present in consequence of the Missouri
persecutions. I told him I was as ready to go South as any where else if he
wished it. As Arkansas lay South of Missouri I asked him if I
should go through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] as it lay direct in our path ^route^ he said
it would be at the risk of ones life & I have not got faith enough to
undertake it if you have you can try it, I asked him if I went
through Jackson County if I should start without purse or scrip as in
general terms that seemed ^according^ to be the law ^of God^. He said that he had not got
faith enough to start on a mission through Jackson County without money
and if I dare it I must do it on my own faith. As the commandments
required the Elders to go out without purs or scrip I felt strenous to keep
the commandments so I ^started without money^ resolved that to go without purse or scrip 
I wished to have some companion go with my ^up^ on my mission I did
not wish to launch forth into the open world alone. I called upon
Elder [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]] (who had accompanied me from [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] New York to Clay Co
Missouri) and asked him if he would not accompany me it met his
wishes and Bishop Partridge gave him his mission with me. And
we immediately ^prepared^ ourselves to start upon our journey And on the 13th day of Jan
1835 I recieved the following recommend in connexion with my priests license
(([[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]], Clay County, Missouri, Jan 13 1835 This certifies that Wilford Woodruff
has faithfully discharged evry duty required of him in the Camp of the Saints
on the 13 day Jan 1835 I received an honorable discharge from Lyman Wight from
the duties of Zions Camp andto by the Elders of Israel and nursed by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] I lay upon
my bed unabled to move untill my breast bone began to nit
together which commenced on the 9th day I began to walk about in
20 days from the time I was hurt and in 30 days from the time I was
hurt I again commenced hard labour. And It has always
appeared miraculous to me that with all the injuries and broken bones
that I have had, I have not a lame limb about me but have
been enabled ever since to endure the hardest manual labor,
exposure, hardships and injuries have even walked 40, 50 & on one occasion
60 miles in a day. However if I over labor or take a severe cold I
feel it more sensibly in my breast and left side than I did
before my last injury.  Thus I have occupied considerable space in
referring to those peculiar circumstances which here attending me ^thus far^ during life
and to sum the matter up it stands about thus. I have broaken
both legs (one twice in two) both arms, both ancles, my breast bone,
3 ribs, have been drowned, froze, & scalded. have been in two
water wheels under a full head of water, bitten by a mad dog
and passed through a score of other hair breadth escapes. Yet the
mercies of God have been over me, and my life has thus far
been preseved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to render
the gratitude of my heart with thanksgiving to my Heavenly
Father praying that the remainder of my days, may be spent
in his service & the building up of his Kingdom
(Page 9th * History) Having embraced the fullness of the Everlasting Gospel of
Jesus Christ and seeing in it great beauty, power, glory & salvation
I had a great ^great^ desire to teach it to my ^the gospel fellow men, and this
desire increased upon me and rested with great wait upon my
mind but ^which^ I did not reveal this to any man ^person^. But one Sunday
evening I retired into the woods alone by myself and called upon
the Lord in earnest prayer to open my way to go and preach
the gospel of Salvation to the children of men ^inhabitants of the Earth^. The Spirit of the
Lord rested upon me & bore witness unto me that my prayer was
heard & should be answered upon my head. I arose from my
knees happy & walked some forty rods through a thick wood into
an open road, as I entered the road there stood before me
Judge [[Elias Higbee|Elias Higby]] an High Priest with whom I had been(*2nd, Page 6th paper apart)
On the 5 day of Oct 1846 while with the Camp of Israel
building up [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarter]] on the west side of the Missouri
River then Indian Country I passsed passed through one of the most
painful scenes of my life and serious misfortune of any of my life
I took my ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the bluffs to cut some shingle
timber to cover my cabin I was acompanied by two other men and
while falling the third tree ^which was an oak over two feet in diameter^ I steped backed of it some 8 feet and also one
side about the same distance where I thought I was entirely out of danger
but when the tree fell (being over two feet in diameter) ther being a crook
in the body of it, it struck a knowl on the ground and the whole body of the tree
shot end ways back of the stump and bounded & the but of the tree struck
me in the breast and knocked me several in the air against a standing
Oak and the falling tree followed me in its bend and caught me
against the standing tree and I came down between ^the two trees^ them one
standing & the other falling but before reaching the ground I was
liberated from between them and struck the ground upon my feet.
It badly bruised my left thigh the whole leangth of it and my hip
also my left arm it also broak my breast bone into also 3 ribs
on my left side it also bruised my lungs, vitals, and left side in
a shocking manor. After the accident I sat upon a log untill
Mr [[John Garrison|John Garrison]] went a quarter of a mile to get my horse. Notwith-
standing I was so badly hurt I had to mount my horse and ride
2 1/2 miles over a very rough road and had to dismout twice in
consequence of miry places, my breast and vitals was so badly torn
to peaces that each step of the horse went through me like an arrow
I continued on horsback untill I arived at [[Turkey Creek, Douglas County, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turky Creek]] on the
North side of Winter Quarters I then became exhausted & was taken
off and carried in a chair to my waggon not having a ^my^ cabin built
I was met in the street by president [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C Kimball]], W
Richards & others who assisted in carrying me to my family. Before lying
me upon my bed the presidency laid hands upon me rebuked my suffering
& distress in the name of the Lord and said I should live and
not die. I was then laid upon my bed in my waggon and as
the Apostles prophesied upon my head so it came to pass I did live and
not die. I employed no physician on this occasion but was administerednan* paper apart page 5, 11th line

On the 29thday of March ^21st^1856
On the 21st day of April 1856 I innoculated my arm with poison & mortifycation
while assisting to remove an ox which had died of poison & beened been skined which
poison worked through my system for seven days before it showed itself outwardly
on the 28th day my arm began to swell was in great pain and showed signs of mortification
I showed it to President [[Brigham Young|Young]] who advised me to clens my stomach immediately
and put on onion poltices and any thing that would draw the poison from
my system into my arm which council I immediately put into execution
29th was another trying day to my life the poison had so thoroughly penetrated
my whole system that my strength left me I could not stand I was led to my
bed my bowels and stomach sceased to act, my speech was like that of a drunken
man President Young called in company with Dr [[Hezekiah Sprague|Sprague]] and laid hands
upon me and rebuked the deseace & the power of the Destroyer which had seized
my body and promised me in the name of the Lord that I should not die but
live to finish my work which was appointed me upon the Earth, I soon began
to recover, the poison ^and mortification^ left my system and centered in my arm which was removed
drawn from my arm through the aid of charcoal poltices mostened with ^a^ strong
decotion of wormwood rag weed & wild sage, the dead flesh was removed from my
arm with instruments and Lunar Castic and in few days I was well again

attended the Special Conference of the Authorities of the Church where the thousands who
assembled on the occasion voted unanimously to sustain the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
as the Presidency and Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
I have ever been impressed sinch since my first acquaintance with the Church
and Kingdom of God upon the Earth with the deep importance of keeping a journal
and record of the dealings of God with this people and our official acts in the
Ministry, and under this view I have written ^sketches of^ most of the sermons and teaching which 
I have ever had from the mouth of Joseph Smith the Prophet and many of the teachings
of the Twelve Apostles and others believing this course to be beneficial to us as well
as the Saints in former generations I would recomend the Elders of Israel to do
likewise that what is recorded on Earth may be recorded in HeavenOn the 4th March [[Phebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe Amelia]] was born. On the 23rd July being out of a stock of

death it was with great difficulty that I was brought to by the laying on of hands. after
my recovery I continued my labours in the [[Nauvoo Printing Office, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|printing office]]. ^Sept 24^ The office took fire
in the upper story in the midst of a large amount of paper and it came near burning ^up^

meeting the house, door yard, and street was crowded and among it was a large mob
a mob had gathered. I preached to the people, 5 came forward and wished to be
baptized the mob surrounded the pool armed with stones.  I dismissed the meeting and went
away but both the congregation and mob remained on the ground till midnight and as there
was no prospect of their dispersing and the candidates were anxious to be baptized, I went
down into the water and baptized five in the mids of a shower of stones the water
was all of a foam for a road around me none that I baptized were hit at all
and I was ownly hit twice one on my hip and one on the head it raised a large
bump on my head which all left me while confirming those I Baptized I afterwards
^subsequently^ baptized many of the mob. I left next morning for [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] attended the conference

A synod of Church ministers became so alarmed for their flocks in that part of
the vineyard they petitioned Parliament to take ^adopt^ some measure to stop our preching they
got for an answer that if they was as well acquainted with the Bible as their hunting
grounds and was as much interested in the welfare of the souls of men as the chasing
of stags and foxes they would not loose so many out of ther Diocese ^of their Congregations^ I arrived

Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and journeyed to Nau M [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] with him crossed the river and settled
my family in a room in the old barracks in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] Brother Brigham Young and family occupied ^I moved my family to Montrose and occupied a room in the barracks^
^with President Young and family^ the same room with me a short time I spent my time attending the meetings, council, and 
conferences in I wrote ^in my journal^ the teaching of Joseph sayings, and prophesyings of Joseph from
time to time as I had an opportunity. July 22 I was with the prophet ^President^ Joseph ^Smith^ and his 
council and the Twelve, it was a day of Gods power with the prophet, he healed many on both
sides of the river who were sick nigh unto death, among ^them^ was [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]] and 
[[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Nobles]], as the Prophet had healed many even the wicked rabble followed
to see the sick healed and as Joseph was about to cross the river a man came to
him and asked him if he would not go about 3 miles and healed two of his small
children which were twins about 3 months old and were sick nigh unto death, he was a
man of the world never herd a sermon preached by a Latter Day Saint, Joseph said 
he could not go, but he would send a man, after a moments hesitation he turned
to me and said you go with this man and heal his children, at the same time giving
me a read po sick [silk] handkerchief and said after you lay hands upon them wipe their faces
with it and they shall be healed, and as long as you will keep that handkerchief it shall
ever remain as a league between you and me, I went and done as I was commanded
and the children were healed. On the 25 I was attacked with the chills and fever for the
first time in my life. I had a chill every other day and was very sick. On the 8th of
I laid hands upon my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children blessed then committed them into the hands of God
and started upon my English mission ^leaving my family sick and with not more than 4 days provision^ Brother Brigham Young rowed me across the river in a 
boat, I was sick and feeble, when I landed I laid down upon the bank of the river on a 
side of soal leather, the prophet Joseph came along and looked at me and said you are starting
on your mission, I said yes, but I look like a poor instrument for a missionary I look
more fit for the hospital or desecting room, ^than a missionary^ he replyed what do you say that for, go ahead in 
the name of the Lord and you shall be healed and blessed on your mission I thanked him
A brother came along with a waggon I got and took me to carried me along a few miles
on my road, I started without purse or scrip I passed by [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley ^P^ Pratt]] who was hewing
house logs for a house barefoot, bareheaded, without coat or jaket on, he came to me and said I have
no money but I have got an empty purse. I will give you that. I went a few rods and found
Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] in nearly the same position, that Parley was, building a log cabin also he crossed
to me and ^said^ I have one dollar I will give you that to put in your purse. He blessed me and I 
went along my way accompanied by Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] I had a shake of the ague every other
day and lay on the bottom of the waggon while I travelled over the ^a^ stubs and stones
we stoped with [[Samuel Smith|Samuel]] and [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Carlos Smith]] at [[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|McComb]] held a meeting with the SaintsMarch 13 I was pressed in spirit to go to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] Illinois and visit the
the saints who had fled their from their persecuters in [[Missouri|Missouri]] I immediately
^March 13^  I took my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] ^Family^ & child into my waggon and started on the 12th March and arived
^March 13 I took my family and started for Quincy where I arived^ 
in Quincy on the 16. I dined with [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma Smith]] at Judge [[John Cleveland|Clevelands]] I then
went on the bank of the river near Quincy and saw ^a great^ many of the Saints
old and young man wom & children lying in the mud and water in a hard rain
storm with^out^ scarcely any tent or covering which ^suffering^ was the fruits ^caused by^ of the unhallowed
persecution of the State of Missouri the sight filled my eyes with tears
while my heart was made glad at the cheerfulness of the Saints in the
midst of ther ^affliction^ dreary position. Sunday 17. I had an interview with Elder
^President^ [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] we held a meeting with the saints $50 and a number
of teams was raised to bring out the remainder of the people from Missouri. I made a statement
of the procedings of the [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] Conference when the Church voted that [[Jonathan Dunham|Jonathan Dunham]]
be reproved for calling a conference at Springfield and for cherishing the wrong spirit
which [[Brother Brewster|Brewster]] possessed.  President Brigham Young councilled that the Twelve as soon
as possible immediately move their families to ^to locate their families in^ Quincy ^for the time being^ so they could be together in council
I left Quincy on the 20th arived in Springfield on the 23rd Held a meeting with the Saints
reproved Elder Dunham for his course in maintaining Brewster in his wrong spirit. He
confessed asked forgiveness & was forgiven I collected a donation of ^I returned to [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] for my effects while at Springfield I collected $70 for the relief of the
Saints in Quincy ^which I sent to them^ A messenger took it to the Brethren in that place. I arived in Rochester
on the 24th. On April 3rd while riding upon the running gears of a waggon, setting upon the
foreward bolster, the bolt came out of the copling pole which left the hind wheels I was imme-
diately shot up between the bolster and tongue with the coupling pole turned over upon the horses backs
the horses became frightened and ran onto an open prairie with me draging my head and
shoulders upon the ground after draging me in this position for several minutes I managed
to dr guide them so as to run into the corner of a high staked worm fence where I
landed with myself ^&^ horses in a pile, and escaped through the mercy of God with ownly a few
bruises without any broken bones. I settled my business and ^I^ returned to Quincy on the
8 April where I left my family and went to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far west]] with the Twelve and
attended the conference on the [[Temple Lot, Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Temple Block]] on the 26 April 1839 where I was ordained
as one of the Twelve Apostles on the corner stone of the Temple under the hands of the Twelve
^Elder^ Brigham Young being mouth. Elder [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] was also ordained ^at the same time^ to the same office. We
returned to Quincy on the 2nd day of May. On the 3rd in company with five of the
Twelve I went to Mr Cleevelands and had a happy interviewed with ^President^ [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the
Prophet who had just escaped out of the hands of his persecuters in Missouri it was thein procuring about two thousand d ollars worth of horses, waggons, tents &c for the 
company. [[Nathaniel Thomas|He]] paid about $1,500 of the expens himself $1,000 of which was to furnish
conveyance for the poor after purchasing the outfit for the company and urging the importance
of their starting as soon as possible not later than the first of Sept. On the 19th Aug
I left thesaints ^upon the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Islands]]^ returned to town of [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]] where we had prepared our outfit and returned
to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] to prepare my own family for the journey, expecting to see the company in
few days but here I remained in great suspens untill the 1st Oct when Elder [[James Townsend|Townsend]]
went to meet the company. They arived in Scarborough on the 3rd Oct with their
waggon covers all flying. The company stoped at the house of Sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Sarah B Foss]]
we went to work nailed down all the covers and painted them and made them water
proof. And in the after noon of the 4th Oct 1838 ^with^ my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] bid her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Father]] [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]] &
friends fare well ^and with her [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child]] two month and a half old in the first stage of the hooping cough^ and we [FIGURE] started upon our journey. The company consisted of
53 persons including Brother Townsend & family and myself and family we had 10 waggons
a pair of horses to each waggon, we had now ^before us at this late period^ commenced this gloo 4th day of Oct
^Before us^ to start upon a gloomy land journey of two thousand miles from Maine to [[Missouri|Missouri]]
we continued to travel from day to day to day through all the rain, mud, cold, frost, and
snow, untill I arived in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]], Sangamont Co Illinos, on the 19th day of Dec.
where I stoped and setled my family and company for the winter. My wife had
passed through a severe course of the brain fever and her s while upon the journey
and her sufferings had been very great her spirit had left her body twice to all
human appearance and ownly been called back through the prayer of faith and the power of
God. Our child had also been very sick and I had become so thoroughly chilled through 
my whole system ^in crossing the bleak prairies^ ^*Brother Thomas had buried one child and^ that it was two months after I stoped before I got sufficiently thawed
nearly all the company had been sick through their exposures some of them had stoped by the way
out and warmed up to feel natural. ** We continued travelling untill we were obliged to
side we had wallowed through much mud and snow had broaken several axeltrees, and
stop in consequence of the bad roads and cold weather, I spent the remainder of
^we suffered much upon the journey yet &^
the winter laboring with my ^hands^ for the support of my family. On the 8th day of March
1839 I attended a conference at [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] Ill. their was present 8 seventies
6 Elders 3 priest and 1 Deacon, several were presented on ordination, we ordained
2 Elders & one priest. Brother [[Brother Brewster|Brewster]] was presented for ordination and Brother
[[Jonathan Dunham|Dunham]] strongly urged that he be ordained as did several others. I strongly objected to it
for I felt that the spirit the man possessed was not of God, a strong influence was
got up in his favor in Springfield, I called a vote of the Elders upon the subject and
all voted for him to be ordained except 3 of us two besides myself he then
came foreward d and demanded baptism ^ordination^ at my hands ^in the name of Jesus Christ^ I told him he should
not be ordained by my consent, for that was not the way God imparted the Holy
priesthood to the children of man he was not ordained and I marvelled that so
many should have voted for his ordination after seeing the spirit he manifesteddisappointed a congregation of people it gave me a happy visit with Elder [[Albert Perry Rockwood|Rockwood]]
in conversing upon the work of God if we were ^although^ in Jail, it was the first time I had ever
met with him. On my return to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] the people were still waiting to hear
me speak though at a late hour, I spoke to them a short time. On the 14 I left 
Boston and walked some 30 miles to [[Holliston, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Hollistown]] to Deacon [[John Haven|Havens]] and preached, I walked to 
[[Providence, Providence County, Rhode Island|Providence]] RI, took steamer to [[New York|New York]] arived on the 18 Met with Br Orson
Pratt and attended meetings with him ^un^till the 27. When I went up the North River
and preached at ^to^ [[Newburgh, Orange County, New York|New Burgh]] and preached in several towns in New York and New
Jersey and walked around the country to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Connecticut and arived at my
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] house on the 11th June 1838 I commenced preaching at my Fathers house
to such as would come together to hear. Ond On the first day of July I baptized
six persons in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]] including my Father, [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step Mother]], and ^my ownly^ sister Unis
[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]], also cousin [[Seth Woodruff|Seth Woodruff]] and aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna Cossett]], and [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]]
a Methodist class Leader who was boarding at my Fathers house. When Father J
the Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith sen]] gave me my blessing he said I should bring
my Fathers household into the Kingdom of God, I felt that it had been fulfilled this
day. I confirmed those baptized and organized this small branch of the Church
consisting of 9 members 8 of which were relatives, I ordained Dwight Webster
to the office of a Priest and administered the sacrament unto them. On the 3rd of July
after committing myself father Aphek Woodruff and his household into the hands of God
I bid them farewell and again ^I^ started for the state of [[Maine|Maine]]. I walked most of the
way to Boston there took steemer for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]] and arived at Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carters]] ^In [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]]^ on the 6th
On the 14th July My [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] was delivered of a daughter wh at her Fathers house which
we named [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]]. On July 22 I wrote a letter to [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B Marsh]]
giving him an account of my labours upon [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]] and the Eastern Country
On the 30th I left Scarborough and returned to the Islands I preached several times
to large congregations in [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] & the methodist meeting house in [[East Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|East Thomaston]]
and in the Town Hall in [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]] before crossing to the Islands where I arived on the 
7th Aug.  On the 9 Aug I received a letter from Thomas B Marsh informing me
of my appointment to fill the place in the Quorum of the Twelve of one who had fallen
and I was requested to come to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] as soon as possible to prepare for a mission
to [[England|England]] in the spring. I immediately visited all the Saints upon both Islands
and earnestly exhorted them to sell their property and prepare themselves to accompany
me to the body of the Church in [[Missouri|Missouri]]. Several immediately sold their property
but many were poor and had not the means to. Brother [[Nathaniel Thomas|Nathaniel Thomas]] said 
he would furnish means to help off all the poor saints upon Fox Islands who wished
to go, and for this purposes went with me to the main land ^on the 13th Aug^ and I assisted himnothing but powder they were harmless. The Baptist and Methodist joined
the mob, ^originated got up^ and tried to stir up the people and lied about us more than proved for their
benefit.  Mr [[William Douglass|Douglass]] the methodist priest on the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]] ^when argument found him^ applyed to the 
^to all the^ magistrates for a warrants against me for a lie bill for overthrowing his doctrin but ^they refused to grant them as he had no^ 
their was not a magistrate on the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Islands]] would issue one to him.
^cause of complaint but religious persecution^
On the 13th Feb 1838 I left the Islands I crossed in the mail boat to [[Hampden, Penobscot County, Maine|Hampden]] on
the main Land. I there met with ^ordained^ [[James Townsend|James Townsend]] I set him apart to the ministry
and we walked together through deep snows to the City of [[Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine|Bangor]], preaching each
night and visited and preached in the Town of [[Searsmont, Waldo County, Maine|searsmont]], [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], [[Northport, Waldo County, Maine|Northport]]
[[Frankfort, Waldo County, Maine|Frankfort]] Hampden, and twice in the City Hall in Bangor, to large assemblies, and
returned to the ^Fox^ Islands via [[Castine, Hancock County, Maine|Casteme]] and the [[Isle of Holt, Knox County, Maine|Isle of Holt]], arived in [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]] the
8th March ^Elder Townsend returned home^. On the 22nd March I accompanied Brother [[Cyrus Starrett|Starreat]] at low tide onto a
barr to some 40 rods from shore to dig som clams, we were soon accompanied by Mrs
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and a Sister [[Sarah Stone|Stone]] who had a curiosity to see how clams were dug, the ground
for some 12 rods near shore was several feet lower than the point we were on we were
so busily ingaged in diging clams we did not observe the flowing tide untill we
were surrounded with water, and having no boat we had no other alternative
ownly to waid ashore and carry the women to dry land in an arm chair, which we
safely accomplished amid the reflection that the tide nor more than time waited for no
man,. On the 4th April I called at the post office and Mr [[John Kent|Kent]] the post master
showed me a letter containing two sheets of fools cap signed by [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]]
and several of the Twelve who had apostitized and been cut off from the Church the
letter was teeming with falshood against [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and the Prophet and all that stood
by him it was sent with the intention to of breaking up the work upon these 
Islands but it did not injure have the do accomplish it or hinder the work.
On the 11th April I was visited by Elder Townsend and [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] who

vessel that I went over in as I had ^an^ appointments in [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|vinal Haven]] on the 17th,
which was necessary for me to attend. I laboured mostly upon those Islands during
^I labored here during^ the winter of 1837 & 8, and as nearly evry person oupon those Islands had over 10 years
old had attended my meetings and investigated the principles of mormonism the people
began to ^and^ take sides either for or against, ^us^ and our enemies would gather together at
times to try ^made attempts^ to break up our meetings, while holding a meeting on the North
[[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|Island]]. On the evening of the 15 Jan 1838 a company of sailors belonging to the
United States Revenue Cutter whose business it was while coasting to protect the
Lives and Liberties of all American citizens as far as they could they hauled
on shore a panel of cannon ^Brought on shore^ a swivel and joined the mob and paraded near
the house where I was speaking ^preaching^ and discharged it several times followed by smaller
arms with the intention of breaking up our meeting, but it ownly caused me to 
preach the longer and louder as some of the mob gathered around to see what effect
it would have I warned them in the name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgments
of God that awaited the wicked and I shook my garments in the presence of the people
and told them I was clear of their blood and ^but^ they heard my voice and words
ownly when mingle with the roar of Cannon and musketry, before I had done
speaking they went back on board of the Revenue Cutter taking their arms with ^them^
having accomplished nothing ownly showing the wickedness of their hearts, and burning
up some powder and grass. at the close of the meeting I baptized 2, also one next
day and while baptizing the mob again commencing^d^ fireing guns but being loaded with[[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]] includes both [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North]] and [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Fox Island]] is in Lat 44 Long 69, 10.

description of it. It is about 10 miles long and 5 wide and is one universal mass of
rocks, much of it granit, formed into shelves, hills, hollows, cut up into nooks and points
and canions to make room for the coves an harbors, which run through and through the

Island contains two stores, three tide saw mills, 6 school houses a small branch of the
methodist Church and a priest the timber is pine fir spruce hemlock and birch, also goose
bury, raspberies & whoretleburies and upland cramburies, grow upon the Island the bushes
and timber grows in a great measure out of the crack and cravices of the rocks
Their is a great amount of variety of fish inhabit the waters, coves, and harbors

On the 23rd Aug while standing upon the farm of [[Ebenezer Carver|Eleazar Carver]] on the North
Island I counted fifty five Islands many of which was inhabited
*On the 6th Sept 
the harbor was filled with a school of Mackerell which the people caught ^in great numbers^ with hooks while
standing upon the wharf we also caught all that we wished in the same wayif they were free for any one of to preach in. [[Gideon J. Newton|He]] said yes I took
out my Bible, Book of Mormon, & Doctrin & Covenants and laid them
all upon his stand he took them up and examined them but asked no
question ^but said said he said would read them^ the hour of meeting arrived, the house was full I preached to
the people upon the first principle of the gospels and bore testimony that the
Lord had raised up a prophet and had commenced to establish his
Church and Kingdom again upon the Earth in fulfillment of the word of 
God or spoken through the Ancient Prophets and Apostles this was the first
discourse ever delivered by any latter Day Saint upon this chain of [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Islands]] Elder 
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] bore testimony to the truth of what I had said I gave liberty to all present
to make any remarks no one spoke, at the close of the meeting I gave out an
appointments for preaching in the four school houses for the next four following evenings
the people came out in mass to investigate the principles which we taught the first
^in^ 14 days of our stay upon the Island we preached 19 discourses. I thus opened
a door for baptisms when Capt [[Justus Ames|Justice Ames]] and his [[Valentine Ames|wife]] came forward
and were baptized by Elder Hale being the first baptized upon those Islands
Elder Newton the Baptist Minister with his family attended about a dozen of the ^twelve^
first of our meetings, read the Books, and was convinced by the spirit of the Lord
that our Doctrin was true and he had a hard struggle for days in his mind
to know which to do either to receive or reject it. He finally resolved to
reject it and took a stand against us. He commenced preaching against us
also sent for Mr [[William Douglass|Douglass]] the Methodist Minister on the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]] to come over
and help him he had been long at variance with Mr Douglas but they now made
friends and united in a war against us but they did not stop the work of God
we continued preaching daily untill we baptized most of the members of Mr
Newtons, Church, and those who owned the meeting house. I then followed
Mr Douglass home to his own Island and commenced preaching to his
Church and baptized a good share of his members ^A number of those that we baptized were^ they also sent for other
^sea Captains,^ Ministers from the Main Land who came over and tryed to put a stop to the work
by preaching and lying about us but the work continued to roll on they wished
me to work a miracle to convince them that my Doctrine was true, I told them
they had rejected the truth and they would see signs but not unto SalvationIt being the first time I had ever seen that class of fish that swallowed Jonah
Aug 18 I left my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] at her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Fathers]] house and in company with Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]]
I started to fill my mission on [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]] as I was directed by the spirit

onto a high hill and bowed before the Lord and prayed that he would open our way and
the spirit of the Lord rested upon us and testified unto us that our prayers would be
answered as we arose from our knees a sloop came into the harbor, we immedia-
tely ^we^ went to the ^Captain^ and inquired where ^he^ they were was going they ^He said^ told us they was going to 
through the Channel of [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]] we asked them for a passage and told them we
had no money except $3 on a broaker bank they said they would take us we
^He gave us a passage^ went on board they set sail and landed us on [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Fox Islands]] at 2 oclock
on the morning of the 20, it being very dark and we not all acquainted with the
country we wandered about for about an hour stumbling over the rocks and ^bushes^ [câââs]

to rest after sleeping several hours we arose were furnished with a breakfast

at the door the meeting had begun, I sent for the Deacon who came to the doors
I told him I wished him to inform the minister that there was two servants ^we were servants^ 
of God at the door who ^and^ wished to deliver a message to that people. He sent word
for us to come into the pulpit accordingly with valiece in hand we walked
up into the pulpit and took a seat one on each side of him, when
he closed his discourse he asked me what hour we would like to speak
to the people I told him at 5 oclock he gave out our appointment and
invited us to his house to take tea we accepted the invitation on arriving at 
his house I asked how many school houses there was on the Island he
said four ^4^ ^four^ and gave me their names ranging from West to East I asked himwith fife and drum hollowing & yelling to stirred up by the ^a^ prysbetarian priest
at the close of the meeting the priest came to me with his rabble and asked many 
questions, he said I had no right to my opinion, and said that no man had a right
to preach the gospel unless he had a Colledge education. I told him I would
admit that point when he would tell me what Colledge Jesus Christ and his
Apostles had obtained their education in and received their diplomas to preach the 
gospel, he ^they^ then left me. On the 12th I preached in a school house in [[West Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|west Avon]]

On the 5th May while labouring for [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] we were visited with a
sudden storm of wind and rain a vain of it past south of the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] in the
form of a whirlwind or tornado which destroyed and injured several buildings
it crushed one of Elders [[Brigham Young|Youngs]] buildings and removed the one we were in ^some 10 feet^ but no
person was injured soon all was calm again. On Sunday May 28 Joseph Smith
addressed the people in the Temple upon the subject of the apostacy in the Church in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]
the spirit of murmuring complaining, and aposticy had increased throughout Kirtland
untill it was almost difficult to tell who was Joseph friends and who were not
this spirit had been incresed in the family circle in secret chambers, and in the streets
untill many ^had apostitized^ were apostitizing not both in high places and through the whol body
of the Church and many were taking strong grounds against Joseph they were
trying to cast him down and destroy his influence. This grieved Joseph to the
heart to have to pass through such perils among fals brethren. But notwithstanding
this thick cloud of darkness which hung over Kirtland Joseph ^He^ remained unmoved
in the cause of God and was determined to magnify his calling and leave the evil
in the hand of God. At this time the number of his friends that occupied high station
in the Church that had faith and moral courage to stand by him shoulder to shoulder
 were vary few among the number was Brigham Young who stood by him in evry
 trial he was also sustained by [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] and a few others
it was in the midst of this scene of things that Joseph entered the stand
congregation and arose in the stand and spoke to the people in the name of the Lord in his
own defence the Lord was with him by his power and spirit to the convincing of the
 honest in heart that he would stand while his enemies would fall. Sidney
Rigdon followed him as he did several others and sustained him in his position
[[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] spoke against him in the bitterness of his heart as had some of the
twelve before, but the people could discern the difference of the spirit between Joseph and
his enemies. But Joseph came off triumphant in all of his difficulties and accusations
that came from fals brethren or his persecution from the world
While in the mist of this scene of things in Kirtland I felt impressed to go out upon
a mission the spirit that was upon me lead me to go to [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]] calledHe unbosomed his feelings in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|House]] of his friends gave much important instruction 
to the Elders which was not reported he urged upon us ^the absolute necessity of giving strict heed to obey^ to give heed to his teachings and
councils ^and the revelations of the Lord to the Church^ and be wise in all things that Zion and her stakes might be redeemed and
esstablished ^no more to be thrown down^ in esstablished. He said that the Kings of the Earth would yet come to
behold the glory of Zion and great and glorios blessings would be bestowed upon the
Saints in the last days. [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram Smith]] followed [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and bore testimony to the truth
of what he had said. He ^&^ was followed by [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]] who made but few 
remarks He exhorted the Saints ^Elders^ to keep within the bounds of their knowledge
and let the great mysteries of the kingdom alone, for the gentiles had not a knowledge
even of the first principles of the gospel, for it is far better to preach what the people
would call the small things of the Kingdom than to enter into the visions of
Isaiah, Ezekiel, and John. He was followed by Elder [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] with
a few remarks. Then the Twelve were called upon to break bread ^which was distributed to the^ to the multi-
tude, (as Jesus did in the days of the Apostles ^who eat and were filled^) And the multitude eat and were filled
and rejoiced together at the closed of the feast thanks was returned to the
Lord for his blessings with uplifted hands to heaven which was at the ^Thanks was returned at the meeting closed at the^ 
setting of the sun. But The House was again filled at candle light
and the meeting again commenced with much interest. The prophet Joseph
^President Smith^ requested the congregation ^Elders^ to speak their feelings freely and sing exhort or
pray as the spirit should give utterance. The meeting continued during the
whole night many of the gifts were poured out upon the people. and at break
of day the meeting was ^we were^ dismissed and we returned to our homes
I also spent the night of the 7th in the Temple with several of the
Elders in prayer and praise before the Lord the Holy Ghost rested upon
us and the spirit of prophesy was given unto ^us^ and many things were
shown us by the Holy Spirit. April 9th Sunday The patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph]]
Smith opened the meeting in the morning by prayer and read the twelvth
Chapter of the 2 second Book of Nephi and preached from it during the forenoon
in the afternoon Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]], [[Orson Pratt|O Pratt]], and S. Rigdon, spoke followed by the
Prophet Joseph ^April 9th president Smith spoke in the afternoon^ He & said in the name of the Lord that the judgments of God would
rest upon those men who had professed to be his friends and friends to humanity
and the ^in^ building up [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] the ^a^ stake of Zion, but had turned traitors to him and
to interest of the Kingdom of God had given power into hands of our enemies
against us, and they had oppressed the poor Saints, and had become covenant 
breakers for which they will feel the wrath of God, he said they had become
whited walls and sought to bring distress upon the Saints
April 13th 1837 I married [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W Carter]] daughter of [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Ezra]] & Sarah
Carter of [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] Maine I was married at the house of President Joseph Smiththat undertake it if they do not spedily repent they will go to hell and burn
their fingers. He reproved the people sharply for their sins darkness and unbelief

The Patirarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith sen]] ^Presided He^ called upon me to read a Chapter in the Book of
Mormon. I read the third Chapter of the Book of Jacob containing the parable of
the bare Olive tree likend unto the House of Israel, I made a few remarks upon
the subject, the time was occupied during the day in singing, exhortation, prayer and
the exercising of the gifts, some spoke in tongues, others interpeted. The Spirit of the Lord
was poured out upon the people in a great degree, at the close of the meeting there was a
^a^ contribution ^was^ taken up for the poor. 26 Sunday in the forenoon the sacrament was
administered to the Saints, in the afternoon Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|W Parrish]] preached the foward

brought the whole assembly congregation into one assembly. The Presidency occupied
the lower stand of the priesthood. And ^and^ President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] arose and addressed
the Saints ^Elders^ for the term of three hours clothed with the spirit and power of GodB [[Joseph Bates Noble|Nobles]] [[Milton Holmes|M Holmes]] and myself when he was ^and^ immediately healed. 17th I met with
the Quorums of the Seventies and heard a lecture delivered by [[David Whitmer|David Whitmore]]
He warned the Elders to humble themselves before the Lord lest his hand be laid upon
us in anger for the sins and pride which the Elders and Saints were running into in our
days of prosperity as did the Ancient Nephites. 24th I met in the evening with the
Seventies several were ordained into the third Quorum of Se under the hands of [[Sylvester Smith|Silvester Smith]]

held till near midnight, we were threatened by a mob from [[Painesville, Lake County, Ohio|Painsville]] to demolish the
[[Kirtland Safety Society Bank, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|bank]] and to plunder but they did not appear but the wrath of our enemies were waxing
hot against us. 25 ^Jan^ At early candle light clouds began to appear ^arise^ in the North East
^and reached unto the North west^ having the appearance of fire and it soon spread over the whole horizon the reflection of the
clouds upon the Earth which was covered with snow had a very ^blood^ red appearance it
commenced at about 6 o clock & continued ^lasted^ till past 10 P.M. 29 Sunday President Joseph
Smith and [[Oliver Cowdery|O Cowdery]] addressed the Saints in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]]. Joseph blessed the people in the
name of the Lord and said if we would be faithful we should arise above our embaris-
ments and be delivered from the hands of our enemies.
(30. I wrote an peace ^article^ which was published in the Messenger & Advocate)
Jan 31: An address was delivered in the Temple upon the temporal interest of the
Church of Christ by President Joseph Smith, and [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]]. A petioton
was prepared to present to the Legislature of Ohio asking for a charter to support
the Kirtland Safety Society.
Feb 19th Sunday I attended the meeting at the Temple ^president^ Joseph ^Smith^ had been absent on
business for the Church but not half as long as Moses was in the mount away from 
Israel yet many of the people in Kirtland if they did not make a calf to worship
as did the Israelites, they turned their hearts away from the Lord and from Joseph
they had engaged in speculation and given away to fals spririts untill they were dark-
ened in their minds and many were opposed to Joseph ^Smith^ and some wished to appoint
David Whitmore as prophet ^a^ to lead the Church in ^his^ stead of Joseph it was in the midst
of this cloud of dark spirits that Joseph returned to Kirtland and this morning arose
in the stand. when he first arose in the he appeared as though he was much
depressed in spirit but soon the spirit of God rested upon him and he addressed the 
Assembly in great plainness for about three hours and he put his enemies to silence
for the time being when he arose he said I am still the ^President^ prophet, seer, and revelator
and leader of the Church of Jesus Christ and kingdom of God upon the Earth.
God and not man has appointed and placed me in this position and No man
or set of men has ^have^ power to remove me or appoint another in my stead and thoseI attended this school through the winter I attended ^the evening^ meetings
with the ^Seventies^ 70s during and other Quorums as I had an opportunity during the
winter of 1836 & 7 and received much valuable instruction. On the evening
of the 20th Dec 1836 I was present at the organization of the third Quorum
^of seventies^ & their was 27 ordained ^among them [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]]^ into that Quorum during this meeting among the number

upon my ^our^ heads.
Jan 6th I visited the office of the [[Kirtland Safety Society Bank, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland Safety Society]] and saw the first paper
that was issued from that institution it was given to [[Jacob Bump|Jacob bump]] in exchange for 
other notes. He was the first to circulate it I herd President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] declare
in the presence of [[Frederick Granger Williams|F. G. Williams]] [[David Whitmer|D Whitmer]] [[Elias Smith|E Smith]] [[Warren Farr Parrish|W Parrish]] & others that he
had received that morning the word of the Lord upon the subject of the Kirtland Safety
Society. He was alone in a room by himself he not ownly had the voice of the spirit
but an audible voice upon the subject and said if we wo the people would give heed
to his council all would be well. On Sunday Jan 8th a large congregation
attended at the Temple two discourses was delivered from the Aaronic Stand by Brother 
[[Vinson Knight|Knight]] and Williams ^Jan^ 10thth I met with the Seventies when twelve were ordained into

against Joseph who set to lead us. 16 Elder A O Smoot was again very severly
attacked with the Cholera Morbus. He was administered to by Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|H C Kimball]] O HydeI gathered this small camp together in Brother [[Albert Petty|Albert Petty]] tent and 
we appointed Elder [[Benjamin Boydston|^Benjamin^ Boydston]] as their leaded to [[Caldwell County, Missouri|Colwell County]] Mo. I then
addressed ^taught them^ upon the subject of their journey the importance of their being united,
following the council of their leader, remembering their prayers night & 
morning, before the Lord. I was followed by Elders Boydston [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Clapp]] & 
[[Daniel Cathcart|Cathcart]] and the rain poured down in torents during the whole time
untill we were thoroughly wet in a good tent
On the morning of the 20 Sept 1836 I parted with this ^the^ camp who
started upon their journey for Zion. I then spent a few days with
Elder [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] in visiting several of the branches we travelled 224 miles
and baptized & & confirmed 8 persons and obtained 30 subscribers for
the Messenger & Advocate. And on the 25 Oct in company with ^with^
A. O Smoot and [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpin]] For the first time in my life I 
went on board of a Steeam boat called the Aid and started upon 
our journey for [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] this was the first time I had ever travelled 
upon a Steem boat.  We left the Steemer at [[Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky|Louisville]] on the

we arrived in Kirtland on the 25 Nov 1836 where I again had the
happy privilege of striking hands ^meeting^ with the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] & many of the Elders
with whom I was acquainted in the Camp of Zion. I went through each 
apartment of the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|temple]], and felt to rejoice in the privilege of treading the 
course of the Temple of ^the Lord^ God which was built by Commandment & Revelation
in my day. Nov 29th It being Sunday I attended meeting in the Temple for the
first time. In the forenoon I heard President Joseph Smith preach to the people
much to my edifycation and comfort. In the afternoon I was called into the
stand to speak to the people I read the 56 chapter of Isaiah and made some remarks
upon it and gave an account of my mission in the South and was followed
by Elder ^A O^ Smoot ^also addressed the Saints^ The Sacrament was administered and I felt to rejoice in
the communion with the Saints. I was councilled with by the Presidency
to attend a Latten ^the^ School in ^the Temple taught by professor [[H. M. Hawes|Haws]] I studied the Latin^ Kirtland during the winter according to council I entered
^Language and English Grammar^ the School taught by Professor Haws and commenced boarding with Brother [[Ira Bond|^Ira^ Bond]]His house also on Sunday the 31st we were threatened with a mob we

they did not mob us but went in the night & poisoned both
of our horses the one which I rode belonging to Brother Samuel 
West died in [tââââ] two days afterwards Brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoots]] recovered
the hogs that eat of the horse flesh also died. August 11th I rode to
Mr [[John Gainer|Gainers]] in [[Henry County, Tennessee|Henry county]] Tennessee ^with Brother Smoot^ where we had the priviledge of again 
met with Brother [[David Wyman Patten|David W Patten]] & his [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|wife]], Brother Patten
and [[Warren Farr Parrish|Parrish]] had been driven from place to place by a mob because 
of their religions they were driven out of [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton]] County into Henry County
Elder Parrish had left for [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. I headed ^laboured^ with Brother Patten
& Smoot and preached daily through the County untill the 29th when
we were visited by Elders [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B Marsh]] & [[Elisha Hurd Groves|Elisha H Groves]]
who had come direct from [[Caldwell County, Missouri|Caldwell County]] Missouri, we had a
pleasing interview. On the 2nd of Sept we held a conference
at [[Damon Creek, Calloway County, Kentucky|Damonds Creek]] Calaway County KY. There were present T. B. Marsh
D W Patten ^of the Twelve Apostles and Elders^ E. H. Groves, W. Woodruff A. O. Smoot [[Daniel Cathcart|D. Cathcart]]
& other official Members. President Marsh presided. [[Randolph Alexander|R Allexander]] Clerk

the South by Elders Marsh & Patten and councilled to go to 
Kirtlind & get my Endowment, as was also Elder ^A O^ Smoot,
we however again visited the south th[r]ough most of the our field
of Labor before leaving and baptized several persons among the number
was [[Parson Beaty|Parson Baity]] a preacher of the Denomination called Christians
On the 19th Sept at the house of Brother [[John Camp|Camps]] in Kentucky I took the parting
hand with Brother ^T. B^ Marsh D. W. Patten & wife & E. H. Groves who started in 
a two hors waggon for [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] Mo. The same day they left I orgin-
ized the first company of Saints who ^that^ ever emigrated from the
Southern States for Zion which consisted of [[Lewis Clapp|Lewis]] & Benjamin Clapp
& families [[Albert Petty|Albert Petty]] & John Camp and their families and Elders
[[Benjamin Boydston|Boydston]] & Cathcart numbering 22 souls I travelled with them the first
day ^8 miles^ to the South fork of [[Mayfield, Graves County, Kentucky|Mayfield]] where we pit[c]hed our tents for the night at the same time began to talk about the mormons & told several
lies which I corrected before the people, this still enraged him worse
and I was forbidden to preach in the house I told the people
as I had been invited to preach to them & had come 10 miles
to fulfill the appointment I would like to preach to them, I was willing 
to stand on a fence, wood pile, on a cart or anyplace they would 
appoint a man rose & said he owned the land in front of the meeting
house I might stand upon that & preach & welcome all the congregation
except the [[Parson Browning|Minister]] & one Deacon left the house walked across the street
formed seats out of a worm fence & gave good attention while I 
preached for an hour & a half upon the first principles of the 
Gospel when I closed I gave liberty for anyone to speak that wished
Mr [[Randolph Alexander|Randolpph Allexander]] arose & made a few remarks it being the
first time he had a Mormon Elder speak, "He said the people at the present
day made him think of a pen of hogs the keeper would make a trought &
pour into it any thing & they would drink it, hot or cold water, dish water
or anything els, but let a stranger come along & pour over a bucket 
of corn on the back side of the pen & the hogs would be frightened & run &
snort all over the pen. He said it was so with the people their priest will
feed the people with ^them on^ any kind of food or doctrine no matter how fals the people 
will drink it down but let a stranger come & preach the truth as Mr
gospel of Jesus Christ which will save the people as Mr Woodruff has 
done & the people are afraid of him." Mr Allexander invited me home
bought a Book of Mormon of me, & was soon baptized and ^as was^ several 
others were soon baptized in that place. July 14 th I wrote a letter 
to president Oliver [[Oliver Cowdery|Cowdery]] at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] Ohio & sent him a list of 
subscribers for the Messenger & Advocate and gave him an account of
my Mission in the South. 18th I rode in company with Brother A
O Smoot to a ferry on the [[Tennessee River, United States|Tennessee River]] their was no ferryman to
cross us over, we were offered the use of the ferry boat, so we let our
own horses unto it & concluded to row ourselves acrosst ^we ferried ourselves^ but not being 
much used to the business and loosing one oar in the river having to row 
with one broaken oar we landed a great distance below the usual place
of landing with a high circulation of blood & blistered hands but 
our horses leaped the bank & we went on our journey to the [[Sandy River, Kentucky|Sandy]]
& swam our horses across the streamwent to Mr [[Thomas Frazier|Thomas Fraziers]] & spent the 
night. July 30th We rode to Mr [[David Crider|David Criders]] and preached atin the last days & when we were opposed by a mob he would rebuke them in great
plainness we were not injured or molested ownly threatened, the sick were freequently
healed under our administration. On the 27th of May 1836 we were
again joined by Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] direct from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] Ohio who also
laboured with us. We held a conference on the 28th day of May at Brother [[Seth Utley|Seth Utley]] ^in [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]] Tennessee^
where there was 7 Branches represented 
containing 116 members [[Abel B. Wilson|Abel Wilson]] & [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpin]] were ordained priest
& [[Albert Petty|Albert Petty]] a teacher. On the 31st day of May I was ordained under
the hands of [[David Wyman Patten|David W Patten]] & Warren Parrish, Elder Patten being mouth unto
the office of the High Priesthood & a member of the 2nd Quorum of Seventies
[FIGURE] Elder Patten prophesied many blessings upon my head. We continued to 
extend our labour upon a circuit of several hundred miles.
Elder [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] also laboured constantly with us and Benjamin
L Clapp freequentlyâwe would travel at times two by two then we would
all meet to gether ^to hold conferences &c^ at certain points we laboured dilligently & faithfully
administering in the ordinances of the gospel as we had an opportunity.
Persecution began to rage against us in Benton County Tennessee and 
on the 19th June a ^states^ warrant was issued against David Patten Warren W 
Parrish & Wilford Woodruff sworn out by [[Mathew Williams|Mathew Williams]] at Methodist
priest served by the shiriff [[Robert Cowan Petty|Robert C Petty]] Elders Patten & Parrish 
were taken by an armed mob of about 50 under form of law led by 
the sheriff a colonel 1st & 2nd Major with other Officers & a 
Methodist priest with a gun upon his shoulder, I was in another 
county & not taken we were accused of prophesying falsely by 
saying that 4 persons who were baptized should received the Holy Ghost 
in 24 hours & that Christ would come in this generation. The second 
time before this generation passed away. The whole concern was a ^mob^ mock trial
contrary to law, justice judgment, mercy or truth. The particulars of which
were recorded in D. W. Pattens account. On the 25 ^June^ I preached in the 
Court House in [[Dresden, Weakley County, Tennessee|Dresden]] Weebly County Tennessee to a crowded house was
followed by Brother A O Smoot & Benjamin Clapp. On the 27 I
went to a Baptist meeting house on [[Thompson Creek, Weakley County, Tennessee|Thompsons Creek]] to fulfill a previous
appointment when I arrived the house was crowded with people I entered the 
pulpit & was asked to speak when the Baptist priest Mr [[Parson Browning|Browning]] arrived 
on horseback at the door directly steped inside the door in great
agitation & told the Deacons to forbid my preaching in the houseswimming our horses & several of the company were females & could not consistently
cross the stream he and we undertook to head the stream so that we could cross
sufficient to ford it, but in in the attemp in the midst of the darkness of the night
& the raging of the wind & rain we became lost in the thick woods we had neither fire,
light, or road, but was in the darkness, rain, wind, mud, creeks, & treetops we crossed 
the stream near twenty times & setting aside our females & horses we made more the appearance
of fishermen than travelers. I thought of Paul's perils by water but the Lord was 
merciful unto us in the midst of our troubles, for while we were gropeing with in 
the darkness like the blind for the wall suffering under the pelt cold ^bursts^ & pelting ^hail^ floods
of wind & rain ^of the storms^ & runing the risk of killing both ourselves & animals by riding off 
steep bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone around about us & revealed unto
us our perilous situation as were upon the edge of a deep gulf, the light continued 
with us untill we found a house & got put upon ^learned^ the right road then the light 
disappeared the darkness returned yet we were enabled to reach the house of Brother 
[[Henry Thomas|Henry Thomas]] at 9 oclock in the evening, without any harm having rode 20 miles
being 5 hours in the storm, having forded creeks or [krakes] twenty or more
times but neither male or female murmured but ^and^ felt to thank God for our preservation
often
I received a letter from [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]] at the time that  Warren 
Parrish was called home. Councilling me to During the winter, ^&^ spring, & for part of the ^summer of 1836^
I continued to labour ^mostly alone^ through [[Kentucky|Kentucky]] & [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] extended my labours opening
new places preaching daily, baptizing, confirming, & organizing new branches
holding conferences &c At a conference held at Brother [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Clapp]] on [[Terrapin, Calloway County, Kentucky|Taropen]]
Calaway County, Kentucky, ^on the 26 day of Feb 1836^ I ordained [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A O. Smoot]] & [[Benjamin Boydston|Benjamin Boydston]]
Elders & [[Daniel Stillwell Thomas|Daniel Thomas]] & Benjamin Clapp to the office of a priest
Brothers Smoot & Clapp both entered into the labour of the ministry
Elder Smoot freequently accompanied me upon my mission
On the 21st day of April 1836 Elder [[David Wyman Patten|David Patten]] returned to Tennessee 
to again join me in my labours he Sister [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|Patten]] came with him
I met with him on the 21st day of April 1836 in [[Henry County, Tennessee|Henry County]] Tennessee
Tennessee it was truly a happy meeting. He related to me the blessings 
which he had received in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] during ther endowment which was 
great & glorious & caused my heart to rejoice We travelled & 
laboured together & preached daily, & continued to baptize such as would
receive our testimony persecution began to rage against us in the South Elder 
Patten bore a very plain & pointed testimony unto the people of the work of Godnearest house on the road. He went out of sight in great haste I then knelt 
down in the water & prayed the Lord to heal me up & the spirit of the Lord rested 
upon me & I was healed the pain left me I arose & went my way ^*^ whenever 
I met with one or more families I preached to them & bore 
my testimony as I went alone to the people I arrived at the [[Mississippi River, United States|Missippi River]]
& crossed it in the evening of the 27th March 1835 [FIGURE]
(*^after^ that night that ^after^ Brother [[Henry Brown|Brown]] left me in trying to travel in the night to me he lost
his ^way^ got into a thicket of brambles & tore nearly all of his cloths off from him
He stoped at a cabin & took him nearly all night to mend up his clothes)
[FIGURE] I stoped for the night at a publick house kept by Mr [[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]] I was [illegible]
up for ^of being^ an imposture Mr Jackson believed I was one of Murrells clan ^instead of a Mormon preacher^ who was
then murdering & stealing Negroes through the country & to test the thing he gathered 
to gether a large house full of the the wickedest & most corrupt J Gentry in the city
& set me to preaching, to them, to test whether I could preach or not. I do not
think that Mr Jackson or the same company of men & women will ever meet 
to gether again for the same purpose to test whether a Mormon Elder could preach or
not for they would not like again to have their sins & abominations revealed to 
each other as plainly & pointedly as I told them that night through the inspiration 
of the Holy Ghost, they seemed glad to get rid of me upon almost any terms,
I travelled from [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]] to Middle Tennessee. And on the 4th of April
I met with Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parish]] at Father [[Joseph Fry|Frys]] in [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]] ^Middle^ Tennessee
He & [[David Wyman Patten|David Patten]] had been labouring to gether through the winter in Tennessee they had 
baptized some 20 or 30 persons Elder Patten had returned to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] at that time
before I arrived. I joined Elder Parrish & we laboured to gether ^over 3 months^ and continued
*^and travelled & preached daily baptizing such as would receive our testimony on the 23rd of June^
^we received a letter from [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]] saying that they wished ^Elder^ Parrish to come to Kirtland & for me to remain^
^to take charge of the Southern Churches & the Lord would bless me in so doing^
to extend our labourse through Tennessee & [[Kentucky|Kentucky]], Elder Warren Parrish ordained
me to the office of an Elder. On the 28th day of June at Father Frys Eagle
Creek Benton County Tennessee  we baptized some 40 persons while labouring to gether
& on the 23rd of July ^1835^ I parted with Elder Parish also returned to Kirtland
This left me alone in my labours in the South. I continued to travel alone
through the year & extended my labours both in Kentucky & Tennessee I baptized 
43 persons during this season 31 after Brother Parrish left me
On the 15 day of Nov while traveling about 12 miles in the night with severall
of the Brethren among whom was Brother [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin Clapp]], a tremendous storm of wind 
& rain over took us it was exceeding dark we bacame lost in a forest & we
crossed a dangerous stream some 20 times we had a creek to cross, the rain
^stream^ had swollen to such an extent by the rain that we could not cross withoutthis created a great wailing & mourning with his famil, Brother [[Henry Brown|Brown]] 
& myself assisted the family in laying him out & burying him. He died 
on the 14th day of Feb 1835 & we buried him on the 16. This clo singular
dispensation of providence brought solemnity upon the people & they began to reflect &
wished to hear preaching, we held several meetings & preached to the people we
baptized a Mr [[Jonathan Hubbel|Hubbel]] & his [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|wife]] aged people who had opened their doors 
& given us a home & just as we had got the people prepared to receive 
the Gospel & anxious to learn & pleading with us to stay & preach, Brother 
Brown resolved that he would continue his journey south. I was fully satisfied 
that should we stop we should build up a Church, & I was convinced it was 
our duty to stop but Brother Brown held the office of an Elder I a priest
& we were travelling together upon a mission, & I felt that I must subject
to those over me in the priesthood, so I submitted.  This is an error which 
many have committed in this Church who were sent as missionaries to the
world, as soon as they get doors open & a people prepared to receive the gospel
they go away & leave them we left this people with tears in their eyes we left
& Brother Brown did not baptize another person during his whole southern
mission we left them on the 2nd day of March went upon the bank of 
the [[Arkansas River, United States|Arkansas River]] cut down a large cotton wood tree dug out a canoe 
4 feet wide 12 feet long put on a pair of oars & rowed down the Arkansas 
River 125 miles to [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little Rock]] geting ^beging^ our food by the way a meal at a time
as we had an opportunity, after visiting Little Rock we tied up our canoe ^travelled down the river 10 miles^ on 
below Little Rock & tied up our canoe on the East Bank & stoped with a Mr Jones
preached next day at his house on the 16 left our canoe with Mr Jones walked back 
^the East Bank of the Arkansas River & started on foot to ward & wade the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]]^
^Swamp to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]] Tennessee we travelled on the old military road it was over 200
miles the way we travelled ^up the river 10 miles took the old^ ^the road^ & almost the whole distance was knee deep in mud &
water up the river 10 miles opposite Little Rock & took the old military 
road & started to waid the missippi swamp which was mostly covered with 
water from Little Rock Arkansas to Memphis Tennessee, a distance of 
about 175 miles, we waided through mud & water knee deep day after day & in some instances
40 miles per day before we could get a stoping place. On the 24th while in the 
swamp I had an attack of the rheumatism & could not travel but slow
My companion Brother Brown had got in a hurry & wished to hasten to 
the Missippi River take boat close up his mission, take boat & return
to his family in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], & as I could not travel as fast as he 
wished so we parted to meet no more for about 3 years he left me siting on 
a log in the mud & water I being lame & unable to walk & no food & 12 miles to the as he could each jump. I told him not to be frightened as we were travellers 
& friends & did not wish to hurt him but wished to stop with him him
over night, when he came to his senses we as he gave us permission to 
stop with him till morning if we would take the bare floor as he did then
we excepted, we asked for something to eat as we had walked 60 miles with[out] eating a 
morsel of food. He said he had nothing for us said that hed had got to kill 
game for his breakfast in the morning. He said the cause of his fright was he
he had shot a large panther dead a few nights before standing in his door, & he thought 
his mate had lit upon him. We lay down upon the bear floor & we were  
glad of this place as it soon began to rain & rained hard through the night
we arose in the morning & went on in the rain 12 miles to a Mr [[Mr. Connor|Conners]]
who was also in the [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] mob who gave us a breakfast but damned 
us while we were eating because we were mormons & when we had finished a 
hearty breakfast we thanked him very politely for it and went our way and left him swareing 
^We did feel thankful for it for we had walked 72 miles without any thing food but very little^
^see page apart 2 page 11^
We continued travelling preaching by the way without stoping ownly over night, ^or on the^ ^Sabbath^ untill
we got to [[Petit Jean River, Arkansas Territory|Petty John Creek]] in the [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas Territory]]. Here Mr Allexander 
Akeman resided with a large family of [[William Akeman|sons]] & one [[Delilah Adaline Akeman Gibbs|daughter]] all of which we 
settelled around him Mr Akeman was a member of the Church in Jackson 
County & a part of his family, [[Prudence Stockton Akeman|his wife]] died strong in the faith in Missouri,
his whole family was mobed some of his [[Wright Akeman|sons]] were whiped severly. But he could 
not stand the persecution & the loss of his property. He moved to Arkansas
to get rid of mormonism had apostitised & was bitter against the work, when 
we called upon him he opposed us strongly, spoke against the leaders of the Church 
& the Book of Mormon. He had one son who received us & had a little 
faith I had a dream the night before I went there what we should meet with
& what would transpire. ^relate the dream^ When we met with opposition not ownly by Mr Akeman
but from many in the neighborhood Elder [[Henry Brown|Brown]] wished to leave the place immediately
& continue his journey I told him I should stay & see my dream fulfilled
we staid in the neighborhood 25 days during which time the Lord brought judgment
upon those who had threatened to mob us & take our lives many of them died suddenly
while we were there and I was warned three times of the Lord to go with Mr
Akeman & bear testimony unto him of the truth of Mormonism & the wickedness
of his course in opposing it & the last time I called upon ^him^ he was filled with wrath 
against me & when I left his house he followed me in a rage apparently with some 
evil intent when a few rod I had got a few rods from his door he was nearly 
treading upon my heels he fell dead at my feet as though he had been 
struck with a thunder bolt ^lightning^. He immediately began to swell & turned blackkept by a Mr [[Michael Geraud|Jerrew]], we asked the minister to direct us there. He gave us directi
^directions^ the Spirit said to me that he was decieving us, directeing us wrong, I asked the question
3 times over & he declaired he was telling us the truth we followed his direction
& it led us into the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage River]] swamp where we were lost in the darkness of 
the night ^we undertook to follow the river but it being about the crookedest one in earth America we made but slow progress^ ^and^ after travelling through mud & water for one hour we concluded to go 
out onto the open prairie & lide lie down in the grass untill morning but when we got 
out into the prairie we h[e]ard the Osage Indians drum & shout at the trading house
as they were having a powwow we followed by the sound, & went into
their midst * ^*as we approached we were met by a dozen large savage looking dogs they smelt of us in a friendly manner^ ^but did not try to bite nor bark we arrived about midnight, covered with mud hungry and weary^ we were kindly received by Mr Jerrew fed & lodged for the night
19th Mr Jerrew gave us a good breakfast set us across the Osage River
^(see paper apart 2nd page 10)^
in a canoe & was started upon our long days walk it being 60 miles to the 
nearest house in the direction we were going ^and we had not a morsel of anything with us to eat^ Most of our travels through the day was
through prairie before dark we entered timber timber land as we were approaching
the timber a large black bear came out of the timber & met us we had 
no weapons but a small pistol but as the bear got within about 6 rods of us he
rose upon his hind feet & examined us a short time & turned & went off
another course we travelled on as fast as we could we were soon invelloped in 
so thick darkness it was with great difficulty that we could keep the road we were
soon surrounded with a large drove of wolves who ^that^ kept up a continual howling
& would freequently rush upon us & come up within a few feet of us we travelled
about one two hours in this situation feeling that we were in danger we concluded 
to stop & build a fire & wait till morning. Accordingly we built a large 
fire which drove the wolves of & as we were about to lie down we h[e]ard 
a dog bark & also a bell, we found we were near a house we took 
each of us a brand of fire & in going about one quarter of a mile we 
found a ^log hut about 12 feet square^ house occupied by one Mr. [[Mr. Williams|Williams]] who was in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] during the 
mobing of the Saints, & he had lately moved to this place depending upon his gun mostly for 
his living it being 60 miles to a house on the north of him, & 12 miles on the south
He and his family was living in a small old log house ^hut^ about 12 feet square & one 
bed in the room upon which lay his wife several children & 3 young dogs. He lay 
stretched out upon the ^bare^ floor with his feet to a small fire there was no door to 
the house but a ragged quilt hung up in the door way, it was past 11 oclock at 
night I turned away the quilt looked into the house every thing was in sound sleep
I spoke 3 times no one stired not even a dog, I walked in & laid my hand upon 
the mans shoulder the mo & spoke to him the moment he felt the wait of 
my hand he leaped to his feet & commenced running around the room leaping as high case of cholera in the camp. The people ^brethren^ covenanted to do this & the plague 
was stayed & there was not another case in camp. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] held several meetings
with the ^Saints^ Saint Set them in order, & ^President Joseph Smith^ returned home with many other of the brethren
I remained with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] laboring with my hands till the following winter. * ^(*see paper apart & page 9th)^
At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wights in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] Missouri
I was ordained to the office of a Priest * ^* By the direction of the High Council under the hands of Brother [[Simeon Dagget Carter|Simeon Carter]] on the 5 day of Nov 1834^ in I had a great desire in my
heart to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to my fellow men for I saw such
blessings, beauty & glory in it that I had a great desire to assist my brethren
in proclaiming it to the inhabitants of the Earth t and this desire continued
to increase upon me, but I did not reveal my feelings to any man, but soon
^(the above lines are in paper apart {[shorthand?]} 32)^
after I was ordained to the office of a priest I received an ^appointment^ mission by Bishop
[[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]] to go in connexion with Elder [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]] on a mission
through the Southern part of Missouri & through the [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], into the Southern
States Agreeable to ^my^ this appointment I bid my brethren farewell in Clay
County & on the 13th day of January 1835 I took my valise in hand weighing
15 lbs mostly Books of Mormon & started in company with Elder Harry ^Brown^ without
without purse or scrip & crossed the ferry ^river^ into [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], * ^* as we stepped onto the bank two horsmen le^a^d there horses onto the bank they eyed us very closely but said^ ^nothing to us^ we stopped south
open our mission This was the first & last time that we ever trod the soil of
Jackson County, we felt thankful for the privilege & we bowed our knees before
the Lord & offered up the gratitude of our hearts unto our Father in heaven for
the privilege & prayed for his protection whi from the mob while going through
the county as the Saints had just been driven out and ^as^ a Latter Day Saint perriled
his life to found in the county, we prayed that the judgments of God might
rest upon the wicked who had shed the blood of the Saints in that land that their
blood might be avenged & that the land might be cleansed from sin wicked-
ness & abominations & redeemed that the Saints might again inherit it
we arose & went on our way rejoiceing. I had in my possession
a petition to the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Governor]] of Missouri for redress of wrongs done us in 
Jackson County for the purpose of obtaining signat[ure] unto it we bent our 
way south through Jackson County without any harm yet in one instance we 
were miraculously preserved from a large mob ^of about 60^ assembled at a grog shop which we 
had to pass. On the 18th Jan we called at the [[Harmony Mission, Bates County, Missouri|Harmony Mission]] had an interview 
with the president of the mission a Presbyterian minister, it was near sun down
he would neither give us any thing to eat nor keep us because we were mormons
it was 15 miles to the nearest house which was an ^[[Michael Geraud|Jerrews]]^ Indian traiding house kepttime I had ever seen him  we appointed a meeting for him to speak to our
little branch, ^He instructed [illegible] us the branch^ and we had a precious time, he spoke till near midnight. He was upon
an important mission in connexion with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], it was to gather up from
100 to 5000 men ^a company^ to go up to redeem Zion. I accompanied Brother [[Parley Parker Pratt|Pratt]] to Jefferson 
County, I told him my circumstances. He said it was my duty to try to prepare myself 
to go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] & join the Camp of Zion. According to his council I went to with
all my might & settelled all my accounts ^business^ & business and on the 11 day of April
1834 I bid my friends farewell, & took a pair of horses & waggon & took with
me Brothers [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]] & [[Warren Ingles|Warren Ingles]], & started for Kirtland Ohio.
I met with [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[John M. Murdock|John Murdoch]], and other Elders on the way & arrived 
in Kirtland on the 25th of April 1834, where I f was introduced to the prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]
the first time I had ever seen him. He invited me to make his house my home
which kind offer I excepted of & staid with him about one week. I have for
the first time became acquainted not ownly with the Prophet Joseph & his family but
with many of the High Priests, Elders & Saints which I had never before seen
I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland & heard many of the ^leading^ Elders speak & I felt to rejoice 
before God for the light & knowledge which was manifest to me during that day
through the preaching of the Elders of Israel. According to appointment I left Kirtland
upon the 1st day of May with a part of the company went to [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]]
where we remained untill all the company came up joined us, from Kirtland & we
were organized.  Then on the 7th day of May we took up our march like the Children
of Israel pitching our tents by the way, & travelled to [[Missouri|Missouri]] according to
the account already spoken of in the Church History, which was called ^the Camp of^ Zions
Camp which went up to redeem Zion & assist those persecuted brethren.
Our whole journey, manner of travelling, incidents upon the way, the way the Lord fought 
our battles with hail & storm, at [[Crooked River, Ray County, Missouri|Crooked River]], the visitation of the cholera to
our camp, the death & burial of the Saints &c has all been published in the Church
History. we arrived After we had pitched our tents in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] Missouri
^our numbers being 205^ & many of the Brethren had been taken sick & some had died Joseph requested the 
camp to dispersed except enough to take care of the sick all who had teams were 
required to leave the ground & go among the brethren I went to Brother Lyman 
Wights in company with [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]] & [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. After a few days
Joseph called the ^Brethren^ people to gather at Lyman Wights and told the people ^them^ if they would 
humble themselves before the Lord & covenant to keep His commandments & obey 
his council the plague should be stayed from that hour, & their should not be another ^Had authority^ to administer in the ordinances of the House of the Lord but believed that it was our
privilege through faith, prayer, & fasting to heal the sick, & cast out devils by the laying on of 
hands which was the case under his administration as numbers could testify.
I was living in this state of mind & in this faith & belief looking for the coming forth of
the Church of Christ when I heard of what was called Mormonism. In 1832 I
was loudly called upon by the spirit of the Lord to go to the state of [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] one of
my brother ^[[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]]^ was also called to go to the same place & at the same time when we met
we both told our feelings & what the spirit of the Lord had whispered unto us & we marvelled 
& wondered what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island, but as we had made preparations 
to move to the west we let outward circumstances controll us, and like Jonah instead of going to 
Ninivah went to Tarshis, so we instead of going to Rhode Island went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] Oswego County
N. York, and there remained until the 29 day of Dec 1833 before I heard a gospel sermon
by a latter day saint.  I then soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island
for at the time we were commanded ^warned^ of the Lord to go there, two of the Elders of the Latter day
Saints were preaching there & had we gone we certainly should have embraced the
work at that time, but as it was we had to wait for the next call
On the 29th day of Dec 1833, Elder [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zera Pulsipher]] & [[Elijah Cheney|Elijah Cheeny]] called
at my house & gave out an appointment for preaching in the school house in that
neighborhood that [illegible] evening I attended as did my brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon Woodruff]]
We both believed, invited the Elders to our home & offered ourselves
for baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the Book of Mormon
& had a testimony that it was true. And on the 31 day of Dec 1833 I was
baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints under the hands
of ^by^ Elder Zera Pulsipher & confirmed the same evening under his hands
On the 2nd day of January 1834 I was ordained to the office of a teacher
& my eldest brother Azmon Woodruff an Elder & a small branch organized
of 12 members all under the hands of ^by^ Elder Pulsipher. In the month of February
I walked in company with Elder Holton some 60 miles to the town of [[Fabius, Onondaga County, New York|Fabeus]] to attend 
an evening meeting of the Saints in that place where Elder Pulsipher was presiding. 
here ^I^ saw for the first time the Book of Commandments or revelations given through 
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and I believed them with all my heart & rejoiced therein & after 
spending two days with them we returned home rejoicing several days with them &
holding several meetings we returned home rejoicing. During the winter we were visited by 
several of the Elders among whom ^was^ Elder [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]] in February. He again called upon 
us about the first of February ^1834^ accompanied by Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] it being the firstsee paper apart*
& after one days rest was enabled to attend to my labors again (see paper apart)
Thes I have occupied considerable space in refering to those peculiar circumstances
which have attended me during life. And to sum the matter up it stands about those
I have broaken both legs (one twice in two) both arms, & both ancles ^my breast bone & 3 ribs^ ^my breast bone & 3 ribs^ have been 
drowned froze & scalded, & bit with a mad dog, have been in two water wheels under
a full head of water *  ^have passed through several severe fits of sickness encountered poison in the worst forms, landed in a pile of rail road ruins have bearly missed the passing bullet^ I have passed through a score of other hair breadth escapes &
Yet the protection & mercy of God has been over me, and my life there from has
been preserved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to render the gratitude
of my heart to my Heavenly Father praying that the remained of my days may be spent
in his service and the building up of his kingdom *) ^It has appeared mirraculous to me that with all the injuries and broaken bones which I have met with with I have^ not a lame limb about me but have ever since
been enabled to endure  the ever since the hardest labour and exposures and journies have ^often^ walked 40, 50 and on one
occasion 60 miles in a day
At an early age my mind began to be ^was^ exercised upon religious subjects. But
I never made a profession of religion untill 1830, being 23 years of age I did not then 
join any church ^for the reason that I could not find any^ for the reason body of people or denomination or Church whos
had for their foundation, doctrin, tenets, faith or practice, ^agreed with^ the gospel of Jesus Christ or 
the ordinances ^&^ gifts & practices which Christ & the Apostles taught  & practiced ^in their day^
in there day & generation for the salvation of the children of Man Although the 
teachers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles, & ordinances which 
the prophets, Savior & the Apostles enjoyed were done away & no longer needed I did 
not believe a word of it to be true ownly as they were done away through the unbeliefs
of the children of men I believed the same gifts graces miracles & power would be 
manifest the same in one age of the world as in another when God did have a Church 
& kingdom upon the Earth, I did not believe that the Church of Christ did exist 
upon the Earth in an organized form, but I believed there had been a falling away
from the Apostolic order of things,  but that the Church & kingdom of God would be
esstablished upon the Earth in my day & generation and that I should live to see it. 
This principle was rivited upon my mind from two causes 1st from the perusal of the 
Old & New Testament with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me what was 
right & wrong & lead me in the path of salvation, without any regard to the opinions of man
& the whisperings of the spirit of the Lord unto me for the space of three years did teach ^taught^
me in accordance with the ^written^ word of God that He was about to set up his Church & Kingdom 
upon the Earth in the last days ^and that his "righteousness was about to be revealed & his salvation to come forth"^ ^as said the Prophet Isaiah in his 56 chapter^ And secondly I was taught this principle from my youth
up to manhood by an aged man by the name of [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]] who lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]] 
Ct who was frequently called the old prophet Mason, ^who taught^ who did teach me many things 
which are now coming to pass. He prophesied of many of those events which are now take
place. He did not believe that any man upon the Earth in the midst of the Christian Nationswheel into about 3 feet of water and my weight drew my legs
out of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft & crushed 
to death. In 1831, while having charge of the Flouring Mill in Collinsv-
ville Ct I was standing inside of a breast wheel 20 feet in diameter
upon one of the arms near the top clearing out the ice when a full head of 
water was let onto it it immediately started. I dropped my ax and leaped
through the wheel to the bottom of it by the shaft & arms about 20 feet as I struck
the bottom of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone well with ownly 
about 2 feet clearance between it & the wheel the wheel caught me & rolled ^me^ out
into the water below where I found myself without any broken bones but with
some bruises & much fright. ^*see paper apart^ In 1833 the day I was baptized into the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints one of my horses newly calked
kicked my hat of my head & had he struck 2 inches lower would probably 
have killed me instantly. In 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same horses
down a hill on a sled without any box the bottom boards sliped forward
under the roll caught the ground turned endways fell on the horses badly
throwing me between the horses they ran to the bottom of the hill draging me
by the lines head foremost with the steed top of me about rods over
a smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangers
In 1834, while travelling in Zions Camp to [[Missouri|Missouri]] a rifle was accidentally
discharged & the ball passed through three tents with a dozen men in each & lodged
in a waggon axletree with a man standing against it it injured no one. It passed within
a few inches of my breast & many others escaped as narrowly as my self
A few months afterwards a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing at
my breast within a few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot but it missed fire
and my life was again preserved.  In April 1839 in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] Ill I was riding
upon the running gears of a waggon without any box, I was sitting upon the fore ward
axletree and the bolt came out fastening the cupling pole this left the hind wheels & my
weight on the forward bolster & tongue turned the coupling pole clear over onto the horses
backs, turned the stakes upside down & shut me up fast between the boulster & tongue
but in such a manner that my head & shoulders dragged on the ground my horses
took fright and ran out into an open pari prairie & thus draged me in this position
for about half a mile when I managed so as to guide them with my left hand so 
as to to run them into a corner of a high worm fence where we landed in a pile
together, I was considerably bruised but landed withou escaped without any broken bonesBecame so chilled & overcome with cold I could not travel, I crawled into the
hollow of a large tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into it
hastened to my ^rescue^ realizeing more fully than I did the danger I was in when he arrived
at the spot I had fallen asleep & was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in
arousing me to a sens of my situation. He procured means to convey me to my
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] house and through a kind profidence my life was again preserved
At 14 years of age I split my left instep open with an ax which went nearly 
through my foot & ^it^ was 9 months getting well. At 15 years of age I was bitten in 
my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of the Hydrophobia. He ownly clamped
my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood and I was preserved through
the mercy of God from an awful death. At the age of 17 I met with an accident
which caused me much suffering & came near ending my life. I was riding a very
ill tempered horse which I was not acquainted with, and while going down a very steep
rocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground suddenly leaped from the road & ran
down the steepest part of the hill amid the thicket & the rocks at full speed and he commenced
kicking up at the same time & about landing me over his head among the rocks but I lodged
on the top of his head grasped one hand hold of each ear as with a death grasp expecting evry
moment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks while in this position sitting astride his neck
with no bridle to guide him but his ears he plunged down the hill among the rocks with all
force ^speed^ untill he ran against a rock which dashed him to the Earth I went over his head
& the rock about one rod & struck the ground square upon my being the ownly thing
visible that saved my life, for had ^I^ struck upon any othe part of my body it must have 
killed me instantly, as it was my boenes bones crushed from under me as though they
were reeds. It broke my left leg twice in two & put out both of my ancles in a 
shocking manner, and the horse came nigh rolling over me in his struggles to
get up. ^My uncle [[Titus Woodruff|Titus Woodruff]] saw^ An uncle of mine saw me fall, hastened to my relief got amist me &
& carried me to his house in an arm chair, I lay from 2 oclok till 10 at night
without ^medical aid^ assistance then my Father arrived bringing Dr T [[Dr. Swift|Swift]] of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] with him
who set my bones boxed up my limbs & carried me in his carriage 8 miles that 
night to my Fathers house my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention
& in 8 weeks I was outdoors upon my cruches & soon was all well again
In 1827 while attending the Flouring Mill attempting to clear the ice out of a water
wheel standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft a man hoisted the gate
let a full head of water upon it as soon as the water struck it it stopped my feet
sliped into [word covered] I immediately plunged head fore most over the rim of the watching my footsteps in order to find some opportunity to take my life from
the Earth but I can ownly attribute the continuation of my life on Earth
to the present time to a merciful God whose hand has been streched out & rescued
me from death in the midst of the many dangers and hair breadths escapes which I 
have passed through in life some of which I will here mention
When three years of age I fell into a caldron of boiling water was instantly caught out
& so badly scalded that is was 9 months before I was considered out of danger. When
five years of age I fell from the great beam of a barn upon my face upon the beam floor
which came near breaking my neck three months afterwards I broke one of my
arms falling down a pair of stairs.  I soon broke the other arm falling out of 
a high stoop across some timber. When six years of age I came near being killed
by a surly bull and was ownly saved as it were by a miracle. During the same year
I went into my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] saw mill with several other children I got upon the head block
to take a ride while running the carriage back not anticipating any danger but before
I was aware of it my leg was caught between the head block & fender post & broak
both bones in two below the knee I was taken to the house & lay 9 hours before my
bones was set which time was spent amid severe pain: but being young my bones
soon nit together & in few weeks I was again upon my feet attending to the sports of
my youth. During my confinement with this lameness my brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] was my
companion in the same room going through with a course of the typus fever
When 7 years of age I was riding on the top of a load of hay which my Uncle
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]] was driving to the barn when he turned the load over on top of 
me and before it was I was nearly strangled for the want of air before it was removed
from me. While 8 years of age I was riding in a one horse waggon with 
several others to go to our labor the horse took fright ran down a steep hill and 
turned us over with the waggon on top of us. But again while in the midst of danger
my life was preserved none of us was seriously injured. While 9 years of age I clumb ^climbed^
into an Elim tree to obtain some bark. I steped upon a dry tree limb and I fell
about 15 feet upon my back which apparently beat the breath out of my body a cousin
ran & told my parents I was dead, before they arrived at the spot I came to my senses
arose upon my feet & met my Parents coming to me. At 12 years of age I
was drowned in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington River]] & sunk in 30 feet of water and was miraculously
saved by a young man named Bacon, I suffered much in being restored to life
At 13 years of age while passing through Farmington meadows in the depth of 
winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an exceeding blustering day I became[[Philo Woodruff|Philo]] born Nov 29 th 1811. Died by poison administered by a physician Nov 25 1827 aged 
16 years. [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel Hart]] born April 11 th 1814. Died ^in [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terrahaut]] In^ October 18th, 1838. Aged 24.  [[Franklin Woodruff|Franklin]] born March 
12 1816 died June 1st 1816 aged 2 months 19 days.  [[Newton Woodruff, b. 1818|Newton]] born June 19, 1818 drowned 
Sept 1820 aged 2 years & 3 months. [[Julius Woodruff|Julius]] born April 22nd 1821 died in infancy
[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] born June 19th 1820. Married to [[Dwight Webster|Dwight]] I baptized her into the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter day Saints July 1st 1838 I married her to Dwight Webster in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Ct
Aug 4th 1841. My Father [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]] like his [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Father]] was a strong constitu-
tioned man, has done a great amout of labour all of his life. He commenced 
attending a flouring mill & a saw mill at 18 years of age which business he has  now
continued in for about 50 years, most of the time he has laboured through the day & one half
of the night. He never made any profession of religion untill I baptized him with all 
his household into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on the 1st day of 
July 1838. Although my Father was not a professor of religion He was a 
man of great charity, honesty, integrity, & truth. He made himself poor as to
wealth by giving to the poor & accomodating his fellow man by loaning money 
and being surety for his neighbor, and always saying yes to evry man who asked 
a favor at his hand.
I was born in the North part of the town of Farmington now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], Hatford ^Hartford^ 
Co Ct, March 1st 1807. I followed the same occupation of my Father
that of a Miller from my youth up until 1831. I assisted my ^Father^ in attending 
the Farmington Mills untill I was 20 years of age, in the spring of 1827 I took
the flouring Mill of my Aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen Wheeler]] which I attended 3 years. In the
spring of 1830 I took charge of the flouring Mill of Mr [[Samuel Collins|Collins]] the Ax manufacturer
in [[South Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|South Canton]] Ct, at the end of one year it was demolished to make way for 
other Machinery, in the spring of 1831, I took charge of the flouring Mill 
owned by Mr [[Richard B. Cowles|Richard B. Cowles]] of [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]] Connecticut. In the 
spring of 1832 in company with my oldest brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon Woodruff]] I 
went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] Oswago County N York & purchased a farm & saw Mill
& setled down in business for awhiles.
Variant & divers are the lives & fortunes of man in every age of the world. While the
path of some are strewn with flowers & ease from the cradle to the graves with
naught to disturb their peace others apparently are marked victims of variated
misfortune accidents & dangers. The last named class is the one in whose ranks
I have stood through my infancy childhood youth & manhood up to the present
time so much so that it has seemed as though some invisible power or fate wasHistory of Wilford Woodruff
In traceing the history of my Fathers I find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory 
account of the Woodruff family (from whom I descended) for more than 
three generation. I learn from the English Book of Heraldry that
Woodruff supposed to be one of my Ancestors was Lord Mayor
of the City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] at the time of the great fire in AD 1649 My Great 
Grand Father [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Woodruff]] lived nearly one hundred years of age and 
possessed a strong Iron Constitution and performed a great amount of 
manual labour nearly up to the time of his death. His wifes name was 
[[Sarah Woodford Woodruff|Sarah]]. He had by her nine children as follows [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1743|Josiah]], [[Appleton Woodruff|Appleton]], [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad]]
[[Elisha Woodruff|Elisha]], [[Joseph Woodruff, b. 1752|Joseph]], [[Rhoda Rosetta Woodruff Gridley|Roda]], [[Phoebe Woodruff, b. 1738|Phebe]] & [[Sarah Ann Woodruff|2 names]] not given. One of his daughters married
married a Chase the other a man by the name of North
My Grandfather Eldad Woodruff was the third son of Josiah 
Woodruff. He was born ^in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Hartford County Connecticut^ in 1751. He like his father possessed a 
strong constitution it was considered ^said^ that he performed the 
most manual labor for several years of any man in Hartford

Twelve while administering to ^him^ at [[Preston, Lancashire, England|prestin]] England, had
a severe contest with them as [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]]
has related in his History
When eleven years of age I had I dreamed
that I saw the had a dream which made a 
great impression upon my mind. In this dream 
the final judgment was portrayed to me, and I 
saw hosts of persons depositing their riches[page folded] of most of the inhabitants of the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Islands]]
while standing upon Mr [[Ebenezer Carver|Carvers]] farm on the East 
end of the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|north Island]] we counted 55 Islands some
were inhabited but the majority of them were not, we also
saw twenty ships under sail at the same time 
we had no lack for food while upon these Islands
for if we did not wish to trouble any of our friends 
for a dinner we would borrow a spead or hoe & bucket
& go onto the beach & dig a peck of clams & boil 
them and they would make us a delicious meal 
which we often practiced, On the 5 Sept, Elder 
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] & myself went onto the top of a high granite 
rock upon the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]], for prayer and supplication
we sat down upon under a pine growing out of 
a fissure of the rock and Brother Hale read the 
XVI Chapter of Jeremiah speaking of the hunters and
fishers that God would chuse up in the last days to 
gather Israel and of a truth here we were on
an Island of the sea standing upon a rock where 
we could sirvey the gallant ships and also the
Islands which were as full of rock holes & coves as any
part of the Earth. But what had brought us here
to search out the blood of Ephraim the honest and
meek of the Earth, and gather them from thereTo the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]] and preached the
Gospel to and baptized nearly all the members
of his Church. The excitement became great
upon both [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Islands]], and on Sunday the
17 of Sept, I met a large assembly from both
Islands in the Baptist Meeting house and
took up the same subject that Mr [[William Douglass|Douglass]]
had dwelt upon against the Book of mormon
and our principles I spoke 2 1/2 hours and
answered ery every objection against the Book of
Mormon or [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] or our principles
I had good attention and the people seemed satisfied
at the close of the meeting Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] administered
the ordinance of baptism, Mr [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]] in
order to try to save his cause went to the
[[Maine|main land]] and brought over several ministers
with him and held a protracted meeting to try
to stop the work of God among the people, but it
was of no avail for the whole people would
attend our meeting and receive the word of God
and we continued to baptize. We visited the dwellingbut (I never learned what his sentiments were 
upon this subject at the end of his tearm of
fourteen years ^imprisonment^ in the Thomastons penetentiary
for a rape upon his daughter the judgment of
which was given upon the testimony of both wife
and daughter) I was present at & heard Mr
[[William Douglass|Douglass]] in his discours upon the occasion
and took minutes of the same when he closed
I came and informed the people I would meet
with them next Sunday in the meeting house &
answer Mr Douglass and wished him as well
as the people to be present I informed the people
that Mr Douglass had made many fals statements
against [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and the mormons a people with
whom he had No aquaintance and he had
misquoted much scripture all of which I wished
to correct. We continued to baptize the people
on the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]] untill we had baptized every
person who owe dollars in the Baptist Meeting
House I then followed Mr Douglass homehis flock. The first two we baptized was a
sea Captain & his [[Betsey Hudson Ames|wife]] by the name of [[Justus Ames|Justis Eames]]
Brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Johnathan H Hale]] went down into the sea
and baptized them on Sunday the 3rd of Sept the
first ever baptized upon any Island of the Sea in
this dispensation to my knowledge, and on the next
sabbath I baptized his Brother [[Ebenezer Eames|Ebenezar Eames]] another
Sea Captain and a young Lady. Mr [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]] the 
Baptist Minister now commenced a war agaist us
against us and sent to the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]] for 
a Mr [[William Douglass|Douglass]] a Methodist Minister to
(with whom he had been at variance for
years) to come over and help him put down
mormonism. He came over and held a conf-
-erence and got all the people together they could 
and he railed against [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the prophet and the Book 
of Mormon and he took the Book in his hand
and with an out stretched [hand] declaired he knew none
of the Judgments of God that would come upon him
for rejected that Book as the word of Godof Christ and the ^ancient^ Apostles, with prophets & Apostles
and the gifts of the Church, as anciently and that 
the Lord had brought forth the Book of 
Mormon. At the close of my remarks Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] 
bore testimony, I gave liberty for any one to speak 
that wished no one spoke at the close I gave 
notice that we should hold meeting during the 
next four evenings in the school house beginning 
with No. 1. The first 13 days of our abode on the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|Island]] 
we preached 17 discourses being invited by the 
Inhabitants to tarry with them I left a copy
of the Doctrins & Covents with Mr [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]] to 
read which he did do and the spirit of God bore testimony
testimony to him of its truths and he walked 
his room till midnight trying to decide what 
to do whether to receive or reject it and he with 
his family attended about a dozen of my first meet-
ings then made up his mind contrary to the 
dictation of the spirit of God to him, to reject it 
and came out against me. But we commenced baptizingthe Bible Book of Mormon & Doctrin & Covents
and laid them on top of each other and took my seat
Mr [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]] took up the Books and looked
at them but said Nothing I then asked him
if there were any school houses on the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|Island]] he
said there was four school houses I asked him
if they were free to preach in he said yes they were
Numbered from one to four at the time appointed
Mr [[William Douglass|Douglass]] & family accompanied us to the
Meeting House where we met a large congregation
none of whom knew who we were or our profession
except Mr Douglass Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] and myself went into
the Stand and I arose amid peculiar feelings and
addressed the congregation for one hour from Gal 1,  Ch
8 & 9 verses. This was the first time that I or [any]
Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints
(to my knowledge) had attempted to preach the Gospel
to the inhabitants of any Island of the Sea fulness
of the Gospel, & the Book of Mormon to the inhabitants
of any Island of the Sea I had much liberty in 
speaking and informed the people that the Lord had raised
up a prophet and organized his Church as in the daysMeeting house about two miles from there so
we thanked her for her kindness and walked to
the Meeting House and steped inside of the door
and stood untill a Deacon came to the door
I asked him to go & tell the Minister in the
pupit that there was two servants of God at
the door who had a message to deliver to that
people & wished the privilege of delivering it. He sent
word to us to come into the pulpit so we walked
through the congregation with our valieces under
our arms, and took a seat each side of the Minister
who was about to speak as we came to the door
He arose and delivered his discours to the people
of about half an hours length, when he closed
he asked me what was my wish I told him we 
wished to speak to the people any hour that would
suit his convenience and the people so he gave
out word that there were two strangers present
who would speak to the people at 5 oclock. We were
quite a wonderment to the people not knowing
who we were Mr [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]] invited us home to
tea which we gladly exepted when we arrived at
his home I opened my valiece and took outMonkfish, Nurshfish, sunfish, swordfish
Thrasher, Cat, Scuppog, Tootog, Eye fish, Cunner, 
Ling, Eels, also Lobsters, Clams, Scollop Mussels 
Wincles, and porposes & seal &c &c
Thus I have a brief account of [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]] 
It was quite dark when we landed upon the 
shore shore at 2 oclock on the morning of the 20 of 
August ^without a farthing in money^. We made our way over the rocks & beaches 
the best we could untillw untill we found a home 
we landed without a farthing in money we rap[p]ed 
at the door a woman put her head out of the 
window and asked who was there & what we wanted I 
told her we were two strangers and wanted a bed 
to lie down untill morning, she let us in ang gave
us a bed and we slept untill quite late in 
the morning it being sunday when we arose and 
took breakfast it was nearly noon I asked 
her what she charged us for our entertainment 
She said we were welcome, I then asked her if 
there was any religion or Minister or Church on the 
[[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|Island]] she informed me there was a Baptist Minister
by the name of [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]] who had a congregation and The[y] get their living entirely by fishing. There

satisfied with the doctrin I taught and
they requested me to hold another meeting, but
I felt anxious to continue my journey and on
the 20 July I parted with my father Step MotherA Pleasing Form, a generous gentle heart

with the Devil she at times was dumb & greatly
afflicted with the evil spirits that dwelt in her
She believed in Jesus of Nazareth and in us as his
servents, and wished us to administer to her
four of us laid hands upon her head and
commanded the Devil in the Name of Jesus Christ
to come ^depart^ out of her, and it was immediately done
and the woman arose with great joy and gave thanks 
and praise unto God for according to her faith she
was made whole from that hour, a child
also that was sick was made whole by the laying on

Having returned from my Southern Mission in the
fall of 1836, in company with [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]]
& [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpit]], I spent the winter in of 1835,,
in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], received my Endowments, and attended the
school taught by profeser [[H. M. Hawes|Haws]] who taught Greek
Latten & English Gramer, I confined myself mostly
to Lattin & English Gramer. This Winter & Spring
in some respects was one of the most interesting in
the History of the Church considering the Endowments &
teachings given and the Apostisy which followed
I was Married to Miss [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe Whittemore Carter]]
on the 13 Day of April 1837, I received my patri-
archal Blessing under the hands of president Joseph
Smith the patriach on the 15 day of April 1837
I felt impressed ^By the spirit of God^ to take a Mission to Fox
Islands, on the East of [[Maine|Maine]] a country I knew
nothing about I made my feelings known to
some of the leading Apostles and they advised me
to go, so on the
Leaves [ink]
Leaves from my Journalno more troubled with evil spirits while in the City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]
as soon as they administered unto us they withdrew from the room
and the light withdrew with them & darkness returned, and my other
of the saying of the patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] in my blessing have
been fulfilled in my experience, but I have said sufficient upon
the subject all the blessings that are sealed upon our heads
will be fulfilled & many more if we are faithful & live for them
In closing my testimony I wish to say that I do not think
that the Lord ever sends an Angel to the Earth to visit the
children of men unless it is necessary to deliver a dispensation
of the Gospel or to declare a message or perform ^a work^ that cannot be
done otherwise. It required an Angel of God to deliver
the gospel to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] because it was not on the 
Earth, and this was in fulfillment of the word of the 
Lord through John the Revelator Rev 14 Ch 6 vers and so
in regard to the administration of Angels in all ages of
the wor[l]d it is to deliver a message and perform a work
work which cannot otherwise be accomplishedMy [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] was gathered to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] with the Saints where he died
aged 83 years. He said I should be wrapt in the arms of heaven and
an angel of God should teach me many things this was fulfilled in the
house of [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Abram O Smote]] in [[Kentucky|Kentucky]] in the spring of 1835. The [[Joseph Smith Sr.|patriarch]]
also told me that I should be delivered from my enemies (who
would seek my destruction) by the mighty power of God & the adm-
inistrations of Angels. This was marvelously fulfilled while in
the City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] in 1840 [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C Kimball]] [[George Albert Smith|George A Smith]]
& myself went to London together in the winter of 1840 the first Elders
who had attempted to establish the Gospel in this great & mighty
as soon as we commenced, the power of the Devil was manifest
the evil spirits gathered to gether for our destruction and at times
they have great power, and would destroy all the Saints of God if
they were not restrained by the power of God Br Smith and myself
were alone together and had retired to our rest each occupying a cot
by ourselves within 3 feet of each other we had only just laid down
untill there seemed to be a legion of Devils made war upon us
to destroy our lives and we were strugling for our lives in the
midst of this warfare of evil spirits untill we were nearly [crushed]
to death and I began to pray the best I could in the midst of the
struggle and asked the Father in the name of Jesus Christ to spare our
lives and while three personages entered the room clothed in white
and surrounded with light walked to our bedside laid hands upon
our heads and we were instantly delivered and from this time hadThe [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Father]] of the prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] was the first patriarch in
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He gave
a great many blessings unto the Latter Day Saints which are
recorded, and many of them have received their fulfillment, when he
puts hands upon the head of a person to bless them it seemed as
though the heavens were opened unto him, and he could reveal the
whole life of the person. He gave me my patriarchal blessing in the 
[[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] of the Lord in Kirtland on the 15 day of April 1837. Many mar-
velous things which he sealed upon my head in which I could see
no earthly chance for their fulfillment has already been fulfilled
to the very letter one or two instances I will name. He said I
should have access to the treasures hid in the sand to assist me in my
necessities in gathering myself and others to Zion. While in [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]]
gathering up the Sants in 1850, [[Alexander Badlam|Allexander Boblam]] went to Cal-
afornia on business and the Saints there who were diging gold filled
a little buck skin sack with gold dust and sent to me to assist
me on my mission by the sale of this treasure from the sands of California
I was enabled to gather myself family & a number of others to Zion
in the Mountains of Israel. He also said I should have power to
bring my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] & his houshold in to the Chur Church of Christ while on
my misson to [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]] I visited my Father in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Conn ^Ct^
and preached the gospel to him and baptized him & all his
houshold including my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Step Mother]] & ownly [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Sister]] M and
a Methodist Class [[Dwight Webster|leader]] who was boarding at my fathersand thousands of others have received the same blessings in the same way
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] received revelation in that [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|Temple]] & there are yet
many revelations to be received in the last days concerning the redemption
of the dead many other subjects but they will all be manifest in
due time through the proper to authority unto the Church & kingdom
of God. There are many other manifestations of the power of God and
the revelations of Jesus Christ to us in our lives but I have said
suffient upon this branch of the subject.

we have been called by revelation to give indowments to
many of the dead honorable men of the Earth & our own Nation
who were not members of our family, but I had said suffi-
cient upon this track of the subject

Patricharchial Blessings & their fulfillment

The office of the patriach is to bestow blessings upon their posterity
and the children of men. In section D. C. 107 The Lord says that
three years previous to the death of Adam he called Seth, Enis,
Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, & Methuselah
who were all High priest with the resedue of his posterity who were righteous
into the Valley of Adam-ondi Ahman and there bestowed upon them 
his last blessing,, And Adam predicted whatsover should befal
his posterity unto the latest generation these things were all written in 
the Book of Enoch and are to be testified of in due time Abram
Isaac & Jacob were patriarchs and blessed their posterity and all
that Jacob said & sealed upon the head of his Twelve sons have all
been fulfilled to the very letter as far as time would admit off
of we have partiarchs the same in our day Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]]
I will refer to one more instance in my experience upon the subject of revelation
all the Latter Day Saints understand that we build Temples for the 
purpose of administering ordinances for our dead as well as for the 
living, and the Lord has opened the way in a remarkable manner
for many of the members of the Church to obtain records of the 
names of their dead for several generation I had also obtained 
a record of some over 3000 of my Father & Mother family, after the 
Dedication of the [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|Temple]] in [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St George]] president [[Brigham Young|Young]] appointed me 
to preside over it, and when we commenced with in the Temple I
begun to reflect how can I redeem my dead, I have some 3000 name
who are dead, that have been baptized for and how can I get endowments 
for them I had none of my family there, and if I had they would not 
be able to get endowments for so many. And while praying to the Lord to 
show me how I could redeem my dead the Spirit of God rested upon 
me and the voice of the spirit of God said to me go to and call upon 
the Son & Daughter of Zion in St George, to come into the temple 
of the Lord and get their Endowments for your dead and it shall be 
acceptable unto me saith the Lord, this fulled my soul with joy 
and turned a key that opened a field as wide as eternity for the salvation 
of our dead, and the redemption of man that we might magnify
our calling as Saviors upon Mount Zion. And one my birth day 
March 1, 1877, the day that I was 70 years, 154 sisters of St George 
went into the Temple & got Endowments for so many of the female portion of 
my dead and this principle was received by president Young and 
adopted from this [lââân] and through the assistans of friends I have 
had nearly 2000 of my dead received Endowments in the Temple of the Lordand will lead the Elders to them. A remarkable instance of this was 
manifest in my own experience in 1840 while laboring in Stafford-
shire was preaching & baptizing daily and one night I went into the 
City Hall of the Town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]] and as I was about to arise to speak 
to a large assembly the voice of the spirit of God to me was this is the last 
meeting you will hold with this people for many days I was asstonished 
at this as I had a weeks appointments out before me I told the people 
it would be the last meeting I would hold with them for many days 
they were as much asstonished as I was at the close of the meeting several 
came forward for baptisim and many asked where I was going I told 
them I did not know, I went before the Lord and asked where I 
should go the voice of the Lord said go to the south I got into a 
stage & rode 80 miles south into [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] and the first mans
home I stayed was [[John Benbow|John Benbows]] who received me kindly & I conversed 
with him & his [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]] untill 2 oclock in the morning & I readily found 
out why the Lord had sent me there their was a company of 600 to 
which Br Benbow belonged called united Brethren who were desiring
for light and truth had got as far as they could and were praying for the Lord 
to open their way and the Lord had sent me to them and the result
was that in the first 30 days after my arrival in their midst I baptized 
some 45 preacher of the united Brethren including [[Thomas Kington|Thomas Kington]] then presidind 
Elder & placed in my hands all their Chapels & homes licensed for 
preaching I baptized the whole of the 600 except one man and during eight 
months labor there I brought into the Church some 1800 Saints including 
near 100 preachers of the various denominations. Now I knew nothing 
about this people or their preperation for the Gospel untill the Lord 
sent me to them by revelationNo I had tarried to long already I drove on briskly ^sprightly^ and
when within 15 miles of [[Wasatch County, Utah Territory|wasatch]] a furious snow
storm overtook me, the wind blowig heavily in my face in
fifteen minutes I could see  no ^the any^ road whatever and knew 
not where or how to guide my horses, and I left my lines
loosly on my horses went inside my waggon, tied down the
cover and committed my life & guideance in the hands of
the Lord and trusted to my horses to find the [way] as they had
twice just passed over the road, I prayed to the Lord to forgive
my sins for not obeying the voice of the spirit to me & prayed that He
would preserve my life. My horses brought me into the wasatch
Station at 9 oclock in the evening with the hubs of my wagon draging
in the snow, I got my horses under cover and had to remain
there until next monday night with the snow six feet deep on
the level & still snowing and it was with great difficulty at last
that I saved the life of my horses by getting them on a box car & taking
them to [[Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Ogden]] while if I had obeyed the revelation of the spirit
of God to me I should have arrived in [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] over a good
road without any storm. Therefore as I have recorded the good & the evil
th[e] result of obediance & disobediance I think I am qualified to
exhort all yo my young friends to always obey the whispering of the of the spirit
of God to you and you will always be safe. The spirt of God will rule
and preside over all men who will permit it & seek for it, and this is
very necessary for young Elders who are laboring in the vineyard of the Lord
for the Lord knows where the righteous livest & meek of the Earth arethis was known to some rode agents in the city and they gathered
a company of robers and went on ahead of Brother [[Charles Coulson Rich|Rich]] and lay
in ambush intending to kill the mormans & rob them of their
money before reaching the company of robers they came to a big path
ahead which shortened their distance the spirit said to Brother
Rich to take that path the Brothren with him marveled at
his course not knowing that enemies awaited them, 
but they arrived in safety at [[San Bernardino, San Bernardino County, California|Sanbernadeno]] with their
lives & money, while the robbers marvelled why their
prey did not come,,I will now give one example in my
own experience of the result of not obeying the voice of the spirit
some years since I had a part of my family living in [[Randolph, Rich County, Utah Territory|Randolph]]
Rich County I was there on a visit with my team in the
Month of Dec one monday Morning my monitor the spirit
watching over me said to my me take your team & go home
to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake]] when I named it to my family who were
there they urged me very hard to stop longer through their 
persuasion I staid untill Saturday morning with the spirit
pressing me very hard to go home I began to feel alarmed to 
think that I had not obeyed the whisperings of the spirit to
me before I took my team & started early Saturday morning
when I arrived at [[Woodruff, Rich County, Utah Territory|Woodruff]] the Bishop urged me to
stop untill monday & he would go with me I told him[[Ohio River, United States|Ohio river]] the boat took fire burnt the tiller ropes
so they could not reach shore and the lives of nearly
all were lost either by fire or water while we arrived in safety to
our destination by obeying the revelation of the spirit of God to 
us. In another instance after attending a large conference in April
and having a good deal of business to attend to I was somewhat 
weary and at the close of the conference I thought I would 
repare to my home and have a rest as I went into the yard 
the spirit says to me take your team & go to the farm which 
is some three miles South of the Tabernacle as I was putting the 
horses on the waggon Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] asked where I was going. I said
to the farm "what for, I do not know,["] but when I arrived there 
I found out. the creek had overflowed broke through my ditch
ditch surrounded my home, filled my barn yard & pig
pen. my wife waiding in the water trying to turn it from the
lot to save the home & the family but through my own exertion
I soon turned it and saved much damage that might
have accrued if I had not obeyed the voice of the spirit. This 
same spirit of revelation has been manifest by many of my brethren
in their labors in the kingdom of God, one of which I will here name
Elder [[Charles Coulson Rich|Charles C Rich]] while going from [[Sacramento, Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]] to San-
bernadino with a company of the Brothern. He had in his posession
quite a large amount of money to make payment on their purchaseof the Home as I was going to bed the same spirit said to me
go & move your Mules away from that oak tree which was
one hundred yards north of our carriage I moved them to a [young]
hickery grove & tied them up & went to bed in thirty minuts
a whirlwind took the tree ^from the shaft near the ground^ to which my mules were fastened
& carried it one hundred yards swept two fences in its course
and laid it prostrate through that yard where my carriage stood
and the top limbs hit my carriage as it was, In the morning I
measured the trunk of the tree where my carriage stood and it measured
two feet & it came within a foot of Br [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] waggon but
did not touch it, so by obeying the revelation of the spirit of God 
to me I saved my life, my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]], and child, & my animals & went
my way rejoicing in the morning,. And in my returne with a
large company of Saints from [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] & the east, in 1850
on my arival in [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|pittsburgh]] I engaged a passage for myself
& company on a Steemer to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St Louis]] I had no sooner
engaged the passage than the spirit says to me go not on
board of that Steemer neither you nor your Company I obeyed
the revelation to me & did not go on board but took
another Steamer the first Steamer started about dark
with 200 passengers on board when 5 miles down the for truth is one of his attributes & the Holy Ghost deceiveth
no man and when a man becomes acquainted with the
whisperings of the Holy Ghost to [his] which is revelation He should
be very careful to obey it for his life may depend upon it
revelation is one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost and for the benefit
of my young friends who may read this work I will give an
account of a few instances of my own experience in listening
to the revelations of the Holy Ghost to me in my missions
In 1848 after my returne to [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|winter Quarters]] from our pioneer
journey, I was appointed by the priesidency of the Church to take my 
family & go to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] & gather up the remnant of the Latter
Day Saints & lead them to the vallis of the mountains while on
my East I drove my carriage into the yard of one of the Brethren
in [[Indiana|Indiana]] & Br [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] set his waggon by the side 
of mine not more than two feet apart I had Deminicus
Carter of [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|provo]] my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] & four children were with me myself
wife & one child went to bed in the carriage the rest slept in the 
home I had been to bed but a short time untill a voice said to me
get up & move your carriage it was not thunder lightning or an
earthquake but the still small voice of the spirit of God the Holy Ghost
I told my wife I must get up & move my carriage she asked what 
for I told I did not know except the spirit told me to do it I got 
up & moved my carriage several rods and set it by the sideunto us again for while the priesthood is rets restored to
the Earth and the revelations of God revealed to us through the
Mouth of prophets & apostles concerning the fullness of the Gospel, Doctrin
ordinances & principles we should study them and treasure up
knowledge by faith & study out of the best books and the 
Holy Ghost will bring to our remembrance those things which
we stand in need of in the self same hour that we are called
to teach the people, but when any Elder priest Elder prophet
apostle or Messenger sent of God to preach the gospel gather
the Saints, work in Temples, or perform any work for the Lord
and that man is faithful and humble before the Lord in his prayers
& duty and there is ay any snare or evil in his path, or the righteous
to be sought out, or danger in the emigration of the Saints
either by the sea or land, or knowledge needed in a Temple then
the Lord will reveal all that is necessary for the protection
& benefit of his prophets, Apostles, Elders & seventy as we can
all Testify in our experience for the last fifty years of our
lives in our labor in the vineyard of the Lord. The teaching
of the prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] to president [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] & the rest
of us was to obtain the Holy Spirit get acquainted with it
watch its operations and listen to the whispering of that
spirit and obey its voice and it soon would become a
principle of revelation unto us. We have found this true in our experience
and in order to prove whether a revelation is from God or not
we follow out the principles revealed to us and we find that what was
manifested to us proved true we know it was from GodHow to obtains revelations from God
In order to obtain revelation from God and in order
to prove when we do obtain a revelation whether it is from
God or not we must follow the teaching of the revelations of
God unto us. St James sayes "if any man lack wisdom let
him ask of God who giveth liberally and upbraideth not and it 
shall be given him". Again ask and you shall receive, ââask
and it shall be given unto you. It was upon this promise
that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] went before the Lord and prayed in the name
of Jesus Christ and asked for knowledge wisdom & understa-
nding in order to know what to do to ^be^ saved and he plead the
promise of St James before the Lord and the Lord opened the 
heavens unto him, and the Father & Son was revealed unto him
and the voice of the great Ellohem unto him was this is my 
Beloved Son hear ye Him this was the first revelation of God
to him and He did harken to the voice of Jesus Christ all his
life afterwards and received a code of revelations and the word of
the Lord unto him as long as He dwelt in the flesh and left as
strong a testament as ever given to the Human family & sealed that
testament with his own life & blood, and we all have to pursue
the same course in order to obtain revelations from God. But I wish 
to impress this truth upon the rising generation and all who read this
testimony that the Lord does not give revelation, or send angels to 
men, or work miracles, to accomodate the notions of any man
who is seeking for a sign, when we have the principles of the Gospel
revealed to us through the mouth of the savior or by inspired
prophets or Apostles we have no need to ask the Lord to reveal them
from there evils, and the Lord has given his angels charge
concering us, and they do all they can for our salvation
but yet we have all have our agency to chuse the good &
refuse the evil, or chuse the evil & refuse the good. The Lord
forces no man to heaven, neither does the Lord tempt any
man to do evil, when a man is tempted to do evil it is
by the power of the Devil, who is an enemy to all rightousness
I feel very annxious to lure our boys & girls our young men and
maidens to seek for that which is good whenever you are tempted
to do evil turn from it never make light of any of the
commandments or ordinances of the Gospel of Christ, and when you
meet with any company who do it shun their society avoid the
use of tobaco & strong drink for they lead to evil, you are
laying a foundation while in the days of your youth for a
character which will decide your destiny through all time
and throughout all eternity either for Good or Evil. The
Lord has told us by revelation "^see D&.C. sec 130^ that whatever knowledge  
or principle of intelligens we attain to in this life it will rise
with us in the resurrection, and any person who gains more 
knowledge and intelligence in this life through his dilligence & obedience
than another will have so much the advantage in the world to come"
Therefore we should all strive to be diligent in obt[ain]ing intelligence
and bring to pass righteousness upon our agency & not wait to
be commanded in all things and great will be your reward for
so doingIt is also said that a generation passes off ery 33 1/3 years
making three generations in a century which would be
three thousand Million in one hundred years 3 times 10 is 30
which would make thirty thousand Million in
1000 years, 3 times 7 is 21, o which would make two hundred 
& ten thousand Millions, is, seven thousand years. The argu
argument might be used that when Adam was created
there was but /2/ on two on the earth and after the flood
but eight souls, but the probability is that during the Millenium
the inhabitants will increase very fast as the age of the children
will be as the age of a tree, and the inhabitants of the Earth
will not die off as they do now. But we will suppose that there
was one hundred thousand Milloin fallen spirits cast down from
from heaven to earth, and that there was one thousand Million
of inhabitants upon the Earth to day that would make one ^one^ hundred
evil spirits to each men, woman & child being on the Earth
and the whole mission and labor of these spirits is to lead
all the children of men to do evil & to destruction. Now I want all
^of^ our boys & girls to reflect upon this, and to see what danger they
are in and the warefare they have to pass through, these hundred evil spirits
^to each one of^ the children of men ^seak to^ and lead them into ery temptation possible to 
use tobaco, smoke drink whisky, get drunk, curse, sware, lie, steal
& comit adultery & Murder & do evry evil thing possible to cut
them off from salvation as far as possible while on the other hand
the spirit of God labors & strive to preserve all the childrenone do you ever consider or contemplate any thing
about the number of evil spirits that occupy the
Earth who are at war against God and Christ and
the saints of God and against all good & seek to destroy
all the Children of men in ery age of the world, let us
reason together a moment upon this subject, it may
be impossible for any man without derct [direct] revelation 
from God to get to know the exact number but we
may approximate to wards it. The Lord has said by revel-
ation that Lucifer an Angel in authority rebelled against
God & drew away one third part of the Hosts of heaven that
were cast down to the Earth & the Heavens wept over him how
many were cast out of heaven down to the Earth We suppose
that the inhabitants of heaven here refered to were the spirits
of our Father in heaven who were to come down to the Earth &
tak[e] tabernacles on the Earth how many were there to come
down & take tabernacles this again may be sufficient to 
take yet perhaps we may come near enough for purpose
it has generally been conceded that there is about 1000 000000
one thousand Million on the earth at a time though the late 
statisticians make out fourteen hundred Million at the present
time but we will say 1000 000 000 one thousand MilloinThe Testimony of Wilford Woodruff
Before closing this little book as a reader for our
Children, I wish to bare my testimony to
upon several principles to the Latter Day Saints
especially to the rising Generation, the young men of
Israel. First I wish to speak of the spirits
of good & evil the Lord says whatsoever leads to 
do good is of God & whater leads to do evil is
of the Devil, this is a very important subject for 
us to understand the scriptures again tell us
that there is many spirits gone out into the
world and we should try the spirits to know what
is of God & what is of the world only. The new testament
says that ery spirit that confesseth that Jesus is the Christ
is born of God, & ery spirit that denyeth that Jesus is the 
Christ is of AntiChrist & is not of God, I will also add
that evry spirit that confesseth that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] was a 
prophet of God, & that the Book of Mormon, Bible & Doctrine
& Covenants are true is of God, and ery spirit that denitheth
denieth this is not of God but is of the evil one I wish 
here to ask our friends the question as well as older

PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S BIRTHDAY.
BIOGRAPHICAL.
On Sunday, February 28, 1897, at 2
p. m., and on the following day, Mon-
day, March 1, at 10 a.m., were exer-
cises in the Tabernacle in honor of the
ninetieth anniversary of the birth of
Elder Wilford Woodroff, President of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
day Saints, and one of the first com-
pany of [[Utah Territory|Utah]] Pioneers that entered
the valley of the [[Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake]].
For this occasion the Tabernacle
has been beautifully decorated.
The speakers' stands are ornamented
in white and old gold, with numerous
flowers and potted ferns and other
plants and around the organ. The
table at the foot of the stands is covered
with flowers, and in front of this seats
are raised above the floor for President
Woodruff and [[Emma Smith Woodruff|wife]] to occupy during
the reception on Monday. Over this
is a canopy draped with the Stars and
Stripes, with electric lights in the top
to throw light upon the couple. This
canopy will remain thrown back upon
the table until the time of the recep-
tion. The upper stand, which will be
occupied by the President and his
wife during the rendering of the pro-
gram, has been raised about sixteen 
inches higher than its usual posi-
tion so that a full view can be 
had of them from every part of the
building. In front of and near the top
of the organ is a beautiful star com-
posed of sixty-one electric lights; over
this and extending from south to
north across the building is a white
streamer bearing the inscriptions
"Glory be to God," "Honor to His 
Prophet," and the three dates, 1807,
1847, 1897. Around the gallery boot-
ing is stretched, with a star over each
post, and at the rear of the building is 
the inscription, "We honor the man
so honored of God." Above the rear of 
the gallery is a banner on which is 
painted 1847-1897. Below this is a
Union flag which passed through the 
war.
Herewith is a brief sketch of Presi-
dent Woodruff's long and eventful life,
furnished by himself:
I was born March 1, 1807, at Northing-
ton, part of the [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] (now [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]]),
Hartford county, Connecticut. In
my early life I worked as a farmer
and miller. Of course my childhood
was passed under the influence of the 
remnants of the Blue Laws of Con-
neticut. I remember the day well 
when the Baptists and the Methodists
in Connecticut were almost as un-
popular as the Mormons afterwards
became. Presbyterians and Congre-
gationalists were the ruling religions
of [[New England, United States|New England]] in my childhood.
In attending Sunday school in my
early boyhood, under Dr. [[Noah Porter|Noah Porter]],
and learning chapters of the Bible
by heart, I saw what Jesus Christ and 
the Apostles taught. Those principles
were so firmly imprinted on my mind
that I could never join any church,
because the churches of that day did
not believe them, until I heard Zara
Pulsipher, a Mormon Elder, preach to
me and my brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], and a 
large congregation of neighbors, at
[[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] (now [[Dansville, Livingston County, New York|Dansville]]), Oswego
county, New York, on the 30th day of
December, 1833. On hearing the first
sermon I and my brother Azmon were
convinced, and we went forth and
[Column 2]
were baptized on the 31st of Decem-
ber, 1833.
I went in Zion's camp, in the spring
of 1835, to [[Missouri|Missouri]], to the assistance
of our people who had been driven
out of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson county]]. Very few of
the members of that Camp are living
today. That thousand miles' journey
with the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] was to
me a school of experience that I shall
never forget in this world or the world
to come. When the Prophet returned to
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] with most of his company I
remained in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay county]], Missouri,
until the 13th of January, 1835, when
I left [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]]'s, in company
with [[Henry Brown|Henry Brown]], to go on a mission
to the Southern states. We passed
through Jackson county, Missouri, and
through [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], and from Little
Rock to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis, Tennessee]]. I spent
two years in Tennessee and Ken-
tucky. While there I was ordained to the
office of an Elder under the hands of
[[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]], and afterwards a
member of the Second quorum of the
Seventy, under the hands of David
W. Patten. I ordained [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] to
the office of an Elder in 1836, and he
traveled with me through Kentucky
and Tennessee, and accompanied me
to Kirtland in the fall of that year. I
organizd four branches of the Church
in Tennessee and Kentucky.
In 1837 I traveled through part of
[[Canada, British North America|Canada]], New York, [[Massachusetts|Massachusetts]],
Connecticut and [[Maine|Maine]] and Fox
Islands. During that mission I bap-
tized several hundred persons and
organized five branches of the Church
in Connecticut, Maine, and Fox Is-
lands. In January, 1837, I was ap-
pointed to the First quorum of Seven-
ties.
In 1838 I traveled on three islands of
the sea and in twelve states of the
Union, established three preaching
places and organized one branch of
the Church in Farmington, Conn.,
with nine of my relatives, including
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house.
On the 26th of April 1839, myself
and [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]] were ordained
to the Apostleship, on the Temple cor-
ner at [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], Missouri. The same
year I crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic ocean]] in
company with [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], to Eng-
land, spending the next year there with
the Twelve Apostles. First I went
to [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]] and organized three
branches. Then I went to Hereford-
shire, [[Worcestershire, England|Worcestershire]] and Gloucester-
shire, where, in eight months, I
brought 1,800 souls into the Church,
including 600 of the United Brethren,
who had broken off from the Wes-
leyan Methodists, with forty-five
preachers, baptizing all of that sect
but one member. I established three
conferences and fifty-eight preaching
places, and organized forty-seven
branches of the Church.
I then went to [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] with Heber
C. Kimball and George A. Smith.
We organized the first branch of the
Church in that city, consisting of
eighty-five members.
In 1841, I traveled over 7,000 miles
through England, [[Wales|Wales]] and parts of
the United States, with the Twelve
Apostles, to attend to the affairs of the
Church.
I spent most of 1842-3 in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], at-
tending to the printing office and other
business. An important year was 1844,
in which the Prophet Joseph Smith and
his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were killed. That
[Column 3]
year I traveled over 10,000 miles in
Canada and the United States, visit
ing the churches, attending meetings,
etc. In the fall of the year I was ap-
pointed to go to England to pre-
side over the British mission, setting
sail at [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] December 7th, and
arriving at [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] January 4, 1845,
during which year I traveled in Eng-
land and [[Scotland|Scotland]], presiding over the
churches, published 3,000 copies of the
Doctrine and Covenants, and secured
the copyright of the same in London.
In 1846 I returned from England to
the United States, and gathered with
the Saints at [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] on the
[[Missouri River, United States|Missouri]], where I spent the winter.
On the 7th of April, 1847, I
left my family and friends at
Winter Quarters and traveled
with President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and
the Pioneer company of 143 men, a
thousand miles across the plains into
the midst of the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]],
arriving in the valley of the Great
Salt Lake on the 24th of July. We
laid out [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]] and built
a fort around ten acres. President
Young and some others of us returned
to Winter Quarters the same season.
In traveling across the plains, for
three days and nights, we met an al-
most endless number of buffalo, going
to their summer ranges to break up
into smaller herds to feed in the Platte
country. They were so numerous that
we could scarcely |find| our way through 
them.
In the spring of 1848 I took my
family and returned to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]], Mass.,
spending the rest of the year and also
1849 in traveling through the New
England states and part of Canada,
gathering up most of the Saints re-
maining there and sending them to the
Rocky Mountains.
On the 9th of April, 1850, with my
family and about a hundred other
Saints, I left Boston, and with steam-
boats, railroads and wagons again
traveled to the Rocky Mountains,
where I arrived on the 14th of October,
having traveled 4,617 miles.
From 1851 to 1877, twenty-six years,
I spent mostly in Utah, traveling and
preaching considerably among the
Saints, and also otherwise fulfilling
the duties of my calling as one of the
Twelve Apostles.
President Young died August 29,
1877, John Taylor succeeding him as
President of the Church.
From 1877 to 1887, during the Presi-
dency of John Taylor, I spent most of
my time traveling, preaching in Utah
and [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]], and laboring in St.
George temple for the salvation and
exaltation of the living and the dead.
When John Taylor was accepted as
President of the church, October 10,
1880, I became president of the
council of the Twelve Apostles.
President Taylor died July 25, 1887,
and it fell to my lot to succeed him in
presiding.
I was accepted as the President of
the Church April 7, 1889, with George
Q. Cannon and [[Joseph Fielding Smith|Joseph F. Smith]] as
my counselors, since which time I
have endeavored to attend to the du-
ties of that office to the best of my
knowledge and ability.
I was appointed assistant historian of
the Church in 1855, and historian in
1881. [[Franklin Dewey Richards|Franklin D. Richards]] was sus-
tained as my successor in that office
April 7, 1889.and carried to my wagon in a chair. 
I was met in the street by Presidents 
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] and
[[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] and others, who assisted
in carrying me to my family. Before
laying me upon my bed, the Presidency 
laid hands upon me, rebuked my suffering 
and distress in the name of the Lord, and 
said I should live and not die. I was
then laid upon my bed in my wagon,
and as the Apostles prophesied upon
my head, so it came to pass. I 
employed no physician on this occasion, 
but was administered to by the Elders 
of Israel and nursed by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]. I 
lay upon my bed unable to move until
my breast bone began to knit together, 
which commenced on the ninth day. 
I began to walk about in twenty days; in 
thirty days from the time I was hurt
I again commenced to do hard labor.

July 5th, 1848âWhile on a mission
to the Eastern States, I drove my
carriage, containing myself and family 
into the dooryard of brother James
Williams in [[Iowa|Iowa]], to camp for the
night. I tied my mules to a large oak 
tree several rods from the carriage. 
As we were about to lay down in the
carriage for the night, I was strongly
impressed to go and move my mules
from the oak tree, and also to move
my carriage. I followed the dictates
of the spirit, and removed my mules to
a small hickory grove, also moved my
carriage several rods, and retired to 
rest. In a short time a heavy rainstorm 
came on, which broke the tree near the 
ground, and laid it prostrate where my 
carriage had stood. As it was, the top 
struck the hind end of the carriage; 
the tree was two feet in diameter. 
Thus, by obeying the whisperings of 
the Spirit, myself and family were
preserved.

On the 21st day of April, 1856, 
while assisting to remove an ox that
had died from poison and had been
skinned, I inoculated my arm with
poison and mortification ensued. The
poison worked through my system for 
seven days before it showed itself out-
wardly. On the 28th my arm began 
to swell, was in great pain and showed
signs of mortification. I showed it to 
President Young, who advised me to 
cleanse my stomach immediately, and 
put on onion poultices, and anything
that would draw the poison from my 
system into my arm, which counsel I 
immediately put in execution. The 
29th was another trying day to my
life; the poison had so thoroughly 
penetrated my whole system, that my 
strength left me; I could not stand, I 
was led to my bed, my bowels and 
stomach ceased to act, my speech was 
like that of a drunken man. President
Young called, in company with Dr. 
Sprague, and laid hands upon me, and
rebuked the disease and the power of
the destroyer which had seized my 
body, and promised me in the name of
the Lord, that I should not die but live 
to finish my work which was appointed
me upon the earth. I soon began to re-
cover. The poison and mortification left 
my system and centered in my arm, and 
was drawn from my arm through the aid
of charcoal poultices, moistened with 
a strong decoction of wormwood, 
ragweed and wild sage; the dead flesh
was removed from my arm with
instruments and lunar caustic, and in
a few days I was well again.

I have occupied considerable space 
in referring to those peculiar circum-
stances which have attended me 
during life, and to sum the matter up
it stands thus:âI have broken both 
legsâone in two placesâboth arms, 
my breast bone and three ribs, and 
had both ankles dislocated. I have 
been drowned, frozen, scalded and bit
by a mad dogâhave been in two water 
wheels under full head of waterâhave 
passed through several severe fits of 
sickness, and encountered poison in its 
worst formsâhave landed in a pile of 
railroad ruinsâhave barely been
missed by the passing bullets, and
have passed through a score of other 
hair-breadth escapes.

It has appeared miraculous to me, 
that with all the injuries and broken
bones which I have had, I have not a
lame limb, but have been enabled to
endure the hardest labor, exposures 
and journeysâhave often walked forty, 
fifty, and on one occasion, sixty miles
in a day. The protection and mercy 
of God has been over me, and my life
thus far has been preserved; for which 
blessings I feel to render the gratitude
of my heart to my Heavenly Father, 
praying that the remainder of my days
may be spent in His service and in the 
building up of his kingdom.

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.
(Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], Feb. 1858.)

On the 5th of October, 1846, while
with the camp of Israel building up 
[[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|winter Quarters]], on the west side of 
the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri river]], (then Indian 
country) I passed through one of the
most painful and serious misfortunes
of my life. I took my axe and went
two and a half miles on to the bluffs to
cut some shingle timber to cover my 
cabin; I was accompanied by two men. 
While the third tree was falling, which 
was an oak, over two feet in diameter,
I stepped behind it some ten feet, and
also to one side the same distance, 
where I thought I would be entirely 
out of danger; but when the tree fell,
there being a crook in the body of it,
which struck a knoll on the ground, 
the whole body shot endways back of 
the stump and bounded, and the butt
of the tree struck me on the breast
and knocked me several feet into the
air against a standing oak, and the 
falling tree followed me in its bound
and caught me against the standing
tree, and I came down between them;
before reaching the earth, however, 
I was liberated from them, and struck 
the ground upon my feet in a badly
bruised condition. My left thigh, the 
whole length of it, and my hip and
left arm were much bruised; my 
breast bone and three ribs on my left 
side were broken; my lungs, vitals and 
left side were also bruised in a 
shocking manner. After the accident
I sat upon a log until Mr. John
Garrison went a quarter of a mile to
get my horse. Notwithstanding I was 
so badly hurt, I mounted my horse, 
and rode two and a half miles over a 
very rough road, dismounting twice in 
consequence of miry places, my breast
and vitals were so badly torn to pieces, 
that at each step of the horse the pain
went through me like an arrow. I con-
tinued on horseback until I arrived at 
[[Turkey Creek, Douglas County, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turkey creek]], on the north side of 
Winter Quarters. I then became
exhausted, and was taken off my horse
[[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|Louis]] to procure a stock of paper. I
went down upon a steamboat; was
six days on the way, during which
time I was severely attacked with 
bilious fever. The day I made my
purchase, the fever was so high I was 
scarcely sensible of what I was doing. 
As soon as I made my purchase and 
got my freight on board, I took my 
berth, and lay there until I arrived at 
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] on the 10th of August. I
was confined to my bed forty days, 
and passed through the most severe
fit of sickness I ever endured; my life 
was despaired of by many of my
friends. I was administered to by 
President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Smith]] and the Twelve; my
life was preserved by the power of 
God. I took a relapse twice after I 
began to recover; once while in Coun-
cil with the Presidency and Twelve, 
my strength left me, my breath stop-
ped, and I felt as though I was struck 
with death.

Sept. 12, 1843âAt five o'clock 
p.m., I left [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on the express
train for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]. While passing
through [[Chesterwoods, Maine|Chesterwoods]], six miles south
of [[Kennebunk, York County, Maine|Kennebunk]], after dark, and while 
going at full speed, we struck one of
the rails which some persons had
raised by rolling a log under it, and 
landed in a pile; three cars were
filled with passengers, and their lives
were saved by having a long train of
freight between the passenger cars and
the engine; all of them were mashed
to pieces; the engineer was killed,
some of the passengers had bones 
broken; I escaped unhurt.

(To be continued.)
I went over both his head and the 
rocks, about one rod, and struck the 
ground square on my feet, being the
only thing visible that saved my life; 
for, had I struck upon any other part 
of my body, it must have killed me
instantly; as it was, my bones crushed
from under me as though they were 
reeds. It broke my left leg in two 
places, and put out both my ankles in
a shocking manner, and the horse 
came near rolling over me in his strug-
gles to get up. My uncle, Titus 
Woodruff, saw me fall, got assistance, 
and carried me to his house. I lay
from 2 p.m. till 10, without medical 
aid; then my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] arrived, bringing 
Dr. Swift, of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], with him,
who set my bones, boxed up my 
limbs, and carried me in his carriage 
eight miles that night to my father's. 
My sufferings were very great. I had 
good attention, however, and in eight
weeks I was out-doors upon my 
crutches.

In 1827, while attempting to clear 
the ice out of a water-wheel, standing
upon the wheel with one arm around 
the shaft, a man hoisted the gate, and
let a full head of water upon it. As 
soon as the water struck the wheel it 
started, my feet slipped into the 
wheel, but I immediately plunged 
head foremost over the rim into about 
three feet of water, and my weight
drew my legs out of the wheel, or I 
should have been drawn under a 
shaft and crushed to death.

In 1831, while having charge of the
flouring mill in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsville]], Connecti-
cut, I was standing inside of a breast 
wheel, 20 feet in diameter, upon one 
of the arms near the top, clearing out 
the ice, when a full head of water was 
let on to it. The wheel immediately
started; but I dropped my ax and
leaped through it to the bottom, by
the shaft and arms, about twenty feet;
as I struck the bottom of the wheel, 
I was rolled out against a ragged stone 
wall, with only about two feet clear-
ance between it and the wheel. The 
wheel caught me and rolled me out
into the water below, where I found
myself without any bones broken, but
with some bruises and much fright.

During the winter of 1831, while in 
[[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New Hartford]], Ct., I passed through
a severe course of lung fever.

In 1833, the day I was baptized, 
one of my horses, newly sharp shod, 
kicked my hat off my head, and had
he struck two inches lower, would
probably have killed me instantly. In
ten minutes afterwards, while driving
the same team down a hill, on a sleigh 
without any box, the bottom boards 
slipped forward under the roller and 
caught the ground, turned endwise, 
and fell on the horses' backs, throw-
ing me between the horses; they ran
to the bottom of the hill, dragging me 
with the lines, head foremost, with
the sleigh on top of me, about twenty 
rods over a smooth snow path; I es-
caped unharmed, however, in the
midst of both dangers.

In 1834, while travelling in Zion's 
Camp in [[Missouri|Missouri]], a rifle was acci-
dentally discharged, and the ball 
passed through three tents, with about
twelve men in each, and lodged in a 
wagon axle-tree, while a man was
standing behind it, and injured no 
one. It passed within a few inches
of my breast, and many others es-
caped as narrowly as myself.

A few months afterwards a musket, 
heavily loaded with buckshot, was 
accidentally snapped within a few feet 
of me, with the muzzle pointed at my 
breast; it had a good flint and was 
well primed, but it missed fire, and 
my life was again preserved.

In April 1839, in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]], Illinois, 
I was riding upon the running gears 
of a wagon without a box, sitting upon
the forward axle-tree, when the bolt, 
fastening the coupling pole, came out, 
which left the hind wheels; and my 
weight on the forward bolster and 
tongue, turned the coupling pole over
on to the horses, turning the stakes 
upside down, and shut me up fast be-
tween the bolster and tongue, but in 
such a manner that my head and 
shoulders dragged on the ground; 
my horses took fright, and ran out 
into an open prairie, and dragged me
in this position for about half a mile. 
I managed to guide them with my
left hand, so as to run them into a 
corner of a high worm fence, where 
we landed in a pile together. I was 
considerably bruised, but escaped 
without any broken bones.

July 23, 1842âPresident Joseph 
Smith sent me from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St.]]

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.
(Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], Feb. 1858.)

At thirteen years of age, while 
passing through [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] meadows,
in the depth of winter, the roads were
drifted with snow; and in an ex-
ceedingly blustering day, I became so 
chilled and overcome with cold, that
I could not travel. I crawled into
the hollow of a large apple tree. A
man in the distance seeing me go in, 
hastened to my rescue, realizing my
danger more fully than I did. When
he arrived at the spot, I had fallen
asleep, and was nearly insensible; he
had much difficulty in arousing me to
a sense of my situation. He procured
means to carry me to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]]
house, and through a kind Providence,
my life was again preserved.

At fourteen years of age, I split my 
left instep open with an ax, which 
went nearly through my foot; it was 
nine months getting well.

At fifteen years of age, I was bitten
in my left hand by a mad dog in the
last stage of hydrophobia. He dented 
my hand with his teeth, but did not
draw blood, and I was again pre-
served, through the mercies of God, 
from an awful death.

At the age of seventeen, I was riding 
a very ill-tempered horse that I was 
not acquainted with; and while going 
down a very steep rocky hill, the 
horse taking advantage of the ground, 
suddenly leaped from the road, and
ran down the steep, amid the rocks, 
at full speed, and commenced kicking 
up, and attempted to throw me over
his head upon the rocks; but I lodged 
upon the top of his head, grasped
hold of each ear as with a death grip, 
expecting every moment to be dashed 
to pieces against the rocks. While in
this position, sitting astride of his 
neck, with no bridle to guide him but
his ears, he plunged down the hill 
under full speed, until he ran against
a rock, and was dashed to the ground.
and would have served me in the same 
way, had I not fallen.

During the same year, I went into
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] saw mill, with several 
others. I got upon the head-block to
take a ride, while the carriage was
running back, not anticipating any 
danger; my leg was caught between 
the head-block and the fender-post, 
and broke both bones of my leg below
the knee. I was taken to the house, 
and lay nine hours before my bones 
were set, suffering severe pain; but 
being young, my bones soon knit 
together, and I was upon my feet 
again. During my confinement by 
this lameness, my brother [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]]
was also confined in the same room
with the typhus fever.

When seven years of age, I was 
riding on the top of a load of hay, 
which my uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozan Woodruff]], was
driving to the barn; he turned the 
load over upon me; I was nearly
suffocated for the want of air, before 
the hay was removed.

At eight years old, I was riding in
a one-horse wagon with several others,
the horse took fright, ran down a
steep hill, and turned the wagon over
upon us; but again, while in the 
midst of danger, my life was preserved;
none of us were seriously injured.

When nine years old, I climbed into 
an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped
upon a dry limb, which broke, and I 
fell about fifteen feet upon my back, 
which beat the breath out of my body. 
A cousin ran and told my parents I 
was dead. Before they arrived at the 
spot, I came to my senses, and met
them.

When twelve years of age, I was 
drowned in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]], and
sunk in 30 feet of water, and after 
carrying one person to the bottom 
with me, I was miraculously saved by 
a young man named [[John Bacon|Bacon]] diving to
the bottom, and carrying with him a 
large stone, to hold him down until he
obtained my body, not expecting to 
save me alive. I suffered much in 
being restored to life.

(To be continued.)
with the Twelve, and remained in the 
[[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|printing-office]] until the 20th of Janu-
ary 1844, when I closed the business, 
and left it well supplied with materials
in the hands of Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]].

I built a two story brick house upon 
my lot.

In the spring of 1844, I was ap-
pointed a mission to go through the
Eastern States with the Quorum of 
the Twelve, and on the 9th of May 
1844, I took the last parting hand 
with President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], in his
own house, in company with J. M. 
Grant. He blessed me, and bid me
God speed. I left Nauvoo in company
with Elders [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]], J. M. Grant
and [[Ezra Thayer|Ezra Thayer]]. We travelled 
through Illinois, [[Indiana|Indiana]] and Michi-
gan, and preached and held Confe-
rences.

June 17âI parted with Elder G. 
A. Smith in [[Franklin, Oakland County, Michigan|Franklin]], Michigan, and
went to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] via the Lakes and 
[[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]]; met with the Twelve in 
Boston on the 27th of June. I at-
tended Conferences and meetings with
the Twelve, and visited [[Maine|Maine]]. I 
was in [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]], ready to step on
board of a steamer for [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]], 
when I saw an account of the martyr-
dom of Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] in 
[[Carthage Jail, Carthage, Hancock County, Illinois|Carthage jail]]; the Spirit bore record to
me it was true. I immediately return-
ed to Boston, met in Council with the 
Twelve, returned with them to Nauvoo, 
where we arrived on the 6th of August. 
I attended the Special Conference of 
the Authorities of the Church, when 
the thousands who assembled on the
occasion, voted unanimously to sus-
tain the Quorum of the Twelve Apos-
tles as the Presidency and leaders of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
day Saints.

I have ever been impressed, since 
my first acquaintance with the Church 
and kingdom of God upon the earth, 
with the importance of keeping a 
journal and record of the dealings of
God with this people, and our official 
acts in the ministry, and under this 
view I have written sketches of most
of the sermons and teachings which I 
have heard from the mouth of Joseph 
Smith the Prophet, and many of the 
teachings of the Twelve Apostles and 
others. Believing this course to be 
beneficial, I would recommend the
Elders of Israel to do likewise, that
what is recorded on earth may be re-
corded in heaven.

CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.

(Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], Feb. 1858.)

Varied and diverse are the lives 
and fortunes of men; while the paths 
of some are strewn with flowers and 
ease from the cradle to the grave, 
with naught to disturb their peace, 
others are marked victims of varied
misfortunes, accidents and dangers. 
The last-named class is the one in 
whose ranks I have stood through my
infancy, childhood, youth and man-
hood, up to the present time, so much 
so, that it has seemed as though some
invisible power or fate was watching
my footsteps, in order to find some
opportunity to take my life from the
earth. I can only attribute the con-
tinuation of my life to the present
time to a merciful God, whose hand 
has been stretched out, and rescued
me from death in the midst of the 
many dangers and hairbreadth escapes 
I have passed through, some of which 
I will here mention.

When three years of age, I fell into
a caldron of boiling water, was in-
stantly caught out, but was so badly 
scalded, that it was nine months be-
fore I was considered out of danger.

At five years of age, I fell from the 
great beam of a barn, striking my face 
upon the floor, which came near 
breaking my neck.

Three months afterwards, I broke 
one of my arms, by falling down
stairs. I soon after broke my other
arm, by falling out of a high stoop 
upon a pile of timber.

When six years of age, I came near
being killed by a surly bull. My 
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and I were feeding pumpkins
to the cattle, a surly bull drove my 
cow away from the one she was eating. 
I took the pumpkin he had left, upon 
which he pitched at me. My father 
told me to throw down the pumpkin
and run. I ran down a steep hill, 
and took the pumpkin with me, being 
determined that the cow should have
her rights. The bull pursued. As 
he was about to overtake me, I step-
ped into a post hole and fell; the bull 
leaped over me, after the pumpkin, 
and tore it to pieces with his horns,

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

I went to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], Maine, after
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]], and also my son, [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]],
who was born March 22, 1840. My 
daughter, [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]], had died 
July 17, 1840.

I returned to [[New York|New York]], and started 
for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], via the Lakes; was 
wrecked on [[Lake Michigan, United States|Lake Michigan]] in the 
steamer Chesapeake, but arrived in 
Nauvoo in safety Oct. 6, 1841, when 
I had the happy privilege of meeting 
with the Prophets [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], 
and my brethren of the Twelve.

I bought a log house of brother 
[[Moses Tracy|Tracy]], on lot No. 1, block 106, on 
Hotchkiss and Durfee Streets. Presi-
dent Joseph Smith afterwards gave 
me the lot.

I spent the winter of 1841-2 attend-
ing meetings, councils, and laboring
with my hands. I attended the Nau-
voo House provision store until the 
3rd Feb., 1842, when I took charge
of the business department of the
[[Nauvoo Printing Office, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|printing-office]].

On the 5th of March, my daughter, 
[[Phebe Amelia Woodruff Snow|Phebe Amelia]], was born.

Sep. 24âThe printing-office took 
fire in the upper story, in the midst 
of a large amount of paper, and was 
with difficulty extinguished.

I remained in Nauvoo, attending 
council meeting and the business of 
the printing-office, until the 7th of 
July 1843, when I started on a mission 
with Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and Geo. 
A. Smith, to the Eastern States, to 
collect funds fo the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] and Nau-
voo House. I gave bonds in the sum 
of two thousand dollars for the faith-
ful return of all monies received.

On my return home in the fall, I
purchased a supply of paper and 
other materials sufficient for the print-
ing-office for more than a year, and
arrived in Nauvoo on the 4th of Nov.

I spent the winter of 1843-4 in 
Nauvoo, received my endowments
seven days, preaching, baptizing, con-
firming and counselling. Numbers 
were added daily to the Church. [[Brigham Young|He]] 
then returned to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]].

I spent about seven months in
[[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], [[Gloucestershire, England|Gloucestershire]] and 
[[Worcestershire, England|Worcestershire]]. We baptized over 
eighteen hundred, including all of the 
"United Brethren" save one. We
baptized over two hundred preachers
of various denominations in that part 
of the vineyard. A synod of church
ministers became so alarmed for their 
flocks in that part of the vineyard, 
they petitioned Parliament to adopt 
measures to stop our preaching. They
received for an answer, that if they
were as well acquainted with the 
Bible as their hunting grounds, and
were as much interested in the welfare
of the souls of men, as the chasing of 
the stags and foxes, they would not 
lose so many of their congregations.

Aug. 18âI visited [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] in com-
pany with Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] and
[[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]]. I labored with them 
in establishing a church, spending 
over five months in that populous city.

We visited nearly every part of the 
city, and all the notable places that 
we could have access to.

I attended all the General Confe-
rences in England, and set sail with 
my brethren of the Twelve on the ship

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

March 1âAs I met in the evening 
with a large assembly in [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], the 
Lord revealed unto me that it would 
be the last meeting that I would hold 
with the Saints in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] for 
many days. I told the people it was
the last meeting I should hold with
them for a season; it created much 
excitement. I had appointments out 
for a week, which I got brother Cor-
don to fill. I went before the Lord in
prayer, and asked him where I should 
go; the Spirit said, "Go to the 
south." According to the directions 
of the Spirit, on the 3rd I went to
[[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], and called upon John 
Benbow, at [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castlefroom]]. I found a 
people prepared for the Gospel. I
preached twice at his house. On the
6th, I baptized six persons, including
John Benbow and [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]]. I here found
a society called "United Brethren," 
numbering about six hundred mem-
bers, and about fifty preachers; Tho-
mas Kington was the presiding elder. 
They came from all quarters to hear 
me preach, and believed my testimony,
and I preached and baptized daily. 
The ministers of the Church of Eng-
land sent three church clerks to see
what I was doing, and I baptized them.
One constable came to arrest me for
preaching, and I baptized him. In 
about thirty days I baptized 160, forty-
eight of whom were preachers of the 
"United Brethren," including their
presiding elder, Thomas Kington.

I established forty-two preaching 
places, licensed according to law.

On the 9th April, I had an appoint-
ment at [[Hawcross, Redmarley D'Abitot, Worcestershire, England|Haw Cross]]. As I was going
into the meeting, letters were put into 
my hands from Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] 
and others, informing me of his arri-
val with five of the Twelve, and re-
questing me to come to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], and
attend a General Conference. A vast 
assembly had gathered to attend my 
meeting; the house, yard and street
were crowded; a mob had also gather-
ed. I preached to the people; five 
came forward to be baptized. The 
mob surrounded the pool, armed with
stones. I dismissed the meeting and 
went away, but the congregation and 
mob remained on the ground till mid-
night; and as there was no prospect 
of their dispersing, and the candidates
were anxious to be baptized, I went 
down into the water and baptized five, 
in the midst of a shower of stones. 
The water was all in a foam for a rod 
around me. None that I baptized 
were hit, and I was only hit twice, 
once on my hip and once on my head; 
the blow on my head raised a large 
bump, which went away while I was 
confirming. Subsequently I baptized
many of the mob.

I left next morning for Preston, 
and attended the Conference with the
Twelve, and returned to Hereford-
shire, accompanied by Elder Brigham
Young, on the 22nd April, and was 
soon joined by Elder Willard Rich-
ards. Elder Young remained twenty-
landed January 11, 1840, in good
health and spirits. When I left my 
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]], he gave me some money to 
assist in paying my passage; also gave
me five dollars, which he requested
me to keep until I arrived in Liver-
pool, saying, I would there need it. 
This I found to be true after landing;
that money was all we had to pay our 
expenses to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], and we had two-
pence left.

We arrived in Preston on the 13th. 
Had a happy interview with brother 
[[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]; held a Council, 
and agreed that Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] go to 
Liverpool, [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]], and
I to [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]].

Jan. 18âI arrived in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]; 
met Elder [[William Clayton|William Clayton]], who pre-
sided over that Branch, numbering 
164 members. I was immediately
called upon to visit a woman possessed 
with the devil. She was raging and 
foaming, and had to be held by four 
men. The more we rebuked the 
devil, the worse she raged. We con-
tinued to pray and administer, until 
we cast the devil out. She arose and 
gave thanks to the Lord. The devil
then entered into a young child, and
we cast him out. I preached several
times, and laid hands on twenty-eight 
persons. I went to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] on the
21st, and met with Elder Alfred 
Cordon, President of the Burslem
Branch, which numbered 66. I com-
menced preaching in the Staffordshire
Potteries. Elder Turley left for Bir-
mingham on the 29th. I remained in 
the Potteries some forty days, preach-
ing, baptizing and confirming, and
blessing children.

(To be continued.)
I landed, I laid down upon the bank
of the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] on a side of sole leather. 
The Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] came along and 
looked at me, and said, "You are
starting on your mission." I said
yes, but I look like a poor instrument
for a missionary; I look more fit for
a hospital or dissecting room than a
mission. He replied, "What do you 
say that for? Go ahead in the name 
of the Lord, and you shall be healed 
and blessed on your mission." I 
thanked him. A brother came along
with a wagon, and carried me a few 
miles on my road. I started without 
purse or scrip, and passed by Parley
P. Pratt, who was hewing logs for a 
house; he was bare-footed, bare-
headed, without coat or vest on. He 
said, "I have no money, but I have
an empty purse; I will give you that." 
I went a few rods, and found Elder 
[[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] building a log cabin. 
He said, "I have one dollar, I will 
give you that to put in your purse."
He blessed me, and I went my way, 
accompanied by Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]. 
I had a shake of the ague every other 
day, and lay on the bottom of the
wagon while I travelled.

We staid with [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel H.]] and Don
Carlos Smith at [[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]], and held a 
meeting with the Saints, who contri-
buted $9 to our necessities, and George
Miller gave us a horse. Father Colt-
rin was going east; he took us into 
his wagon to help us along. We 
spent five days in [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], where
Elder Taylor printed fifteen hundred 
copies of a pamphlet upon the Mis-
souri persecution. We sold our horse, 
and left on the 21st, and continued 
our journey. We spent the night of
the 24th with Dr. [[Charles Burns Modesitt|Modisett]], of Terre-
haute.

On the 28th, while travelling, Elder 
Taylor fell to the ground as though he
had been knocked down. We admini-
stered to him, and he revived. On 
the following day he fell again, and
fainted several times; it seemed as
though the destroyer would take his
life. We travelled with him four days
after he was taken sick. His sickness
proved to be bilious fever. We stop-
ped with him two days at a German 
tavern, in [[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]], Wayne county,
Indiana, with a kind family with
whom he was acquainted. Father 
Coltrin would stay no longer. I pro-
posed to remain with Brother Taylor,
but as I was sick with fever and ague, 
and not able to take care of myself, 
brother Taylor advised me to continue
my journey with Father [[Zebedee Coltrin|Coltrin]], say-
ing, "It is easier to take care of one
sick man than two." I committed
him into the hands of God, and the
family promised to do all in their 
power to make him comfortable. I 
parted from him with a heavy heart.

Sept. 2âI continued my journey 
with Father Coltrin to [[Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cleveland]],
Ohio. I there took steamer on the 
10th for [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]]; had a severe gale,
and did not reach Buffalo until the 
12th. I travelled to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]] on a 
canal boat; had the ague daily, was 
very sick; had no companions except
sectarian priests, who were daily ly-
ing about the "Mormons." I took 
stage at Albany for [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Con-
necticut, on the night of the 19th, and 
rode all night and the following day; 
suffered severely with fever and ague.
I arrived at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house in 
Farmington on the 21st, quite sick.
I found my father and family well.

On the 27th Sept., 1839, my mater-
nal grandmother, [[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|Anna Thompson]],
died, aged 84; I was too sick to attend 
her funeral. It is a singular incident
that my grandfather, [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot Thompson]],
and Anna Thompson his wife, Samuel 
Thompson and [[Mercy Thompson|Mercy Thompson]], all
of one family, died in their 84th year.

On the 4th October, [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adner Hart]],
brother to my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-mother]], died, aged 
43. He requested me to preach his 
funeral sermon. I had been sick at
my father's house, with the ague, for 
fifteen days, attended with a severe 
cough, and the hour appointed for the 
funeral was the time for my ague, yet 
I attended the funeral and preached, 
and I had no more ague for many 
days. I left on the 7th, and visited 
New York, [[Long Island, Queens County, New York|Long Island]], and New
Jersey, in very poor health.

Nov. 1âI assisted Elders [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clark]], 
[[Alexander Wright|Wright]] and [[Samuel Mulliner|Mulliner]], to set sail for 
[[England|England]]. Elder John Taylor had re-
covered from his sickness, and arrived
in New York on the 13th December.

Dec. 19âIn company with Elders 
John Taylor and [[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley]], I 
went on board the packet-ship Oxford,
and sailed for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]], where I

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

July 22âI was with President 
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and his Council and the
Twelve; it was a day of God's power
with the Prophet. He healed many 
who were sick nigh unto death, among 
whom were [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]] and
[[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Nobles]]; even the wicked 
rabble followed to see the sick healed. 
As Joseph was about to cross the
[[Mississippi River, United States|river]], a man came to him and asked 
him if he would go about three miles 
and heal two of his small children, 
who were twins, about three months 
old, and were sick nigh unto death. 
He was a man of the world, he had
never heard a sermon preached by a 
Latter-day Saint. Joseph said he 
could not go, but he would send a 
man. After hesitating a moment, he
turned to me and said, "You go with 
this man and heal his children," at
the same time giving me a red silk 
handkerchief, and said, "After you 
lay hands upon them, wipe their faces 
with it, and they shall be healed; and 
as long as you will keep that handker-
chief, it shall ever remain as a league 
between you and me." I went and 
did as I was commanded, and the 
children were healed.

On the 25th, I was attacked with
chills and fever. I had a chill every 
other day, and was very sick.

August 8âI laid my hands upon
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and children, blessed them,
committed them into the hands of 
God, and started upon my English 
mission, leaving my family sick, and 
with not more than four days' pro-
visions. Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] 
rowed me across the Mississippi in a 
boat; I was sick and feeble. When
of teams were raised to bring out the 
remainder of the poor from [[Missouri|Missouri]]. 
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] counselled the 
Twelve to locate their families for the 
time being in [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]]. I returned to
[[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] for my effects. While at 
[[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], I collected $70 for the
relief of the Saints in Quincy, which I 
sent to them. I returned to Quincy 
on the 8th of April, where I left my
family, and went to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] with
the Twelve, and attended the Con-
ference on the Temple block on the 
 26th, where I was ordained one of 
the Twelve Apostles, on the corner 
stone of the Temple, under the hands 
of the Twelve, Elder Brigham Young
being mouth. Elder [[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]] 
was also ordained at the same time. 
We returned to Quincy on the 2nd 
day of May.

On the 3rd, in company with five
of the Twelve, I went to Judge Cleve-
land's, and had a happy interview 
with President [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], who
had just escaped out of the hands of 
his persecutors in Missouri; it was
the first time I had seen him for more
than two years, and it was a happy
meeting. I attended the Conference
and meetings with the Saints in Quin-
cy, until the 15th, when I moved my
family to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]], and occupied a
room in the barracks with President
Young and family. I spent my time 
in attending the meetings, Councils
and Conferences. I wrote in my 
journal the teachings, sayings and 
prophecies of Joseph from time to 
time, as I had opportunity.

(To be continued.)
Church, consisting of nine members, 
eight of whom were relatives. I or-
dained [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]] a Priest, and
administered the sacrament.

July 3âI started for the State of 
[[Maine|Maine]], and arrived at father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]], 
in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], on the 6th.

â14âMy [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] was delivered of a
daughter at her father's house; we 
named her [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]].

22âI wrote to [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B. Marsh]], 
an account of my labors upon Fox 
Islands and the eastern country.

â30âI left Scarborough and re-
turned to the islands. I preached
several times to large congregations in 
the Methodist meeting-house, in East 
Thomastown, and in the town hall in 
[[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]], before crossing to the islands, 
where I arrived August 7th.

August 9âI received a letter from
Thomas B. Marsh, informing me of 
my appointment to fill the place, in
the Quorum of the Twelve, of one 
who had fallen, and I was requested 
to come to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] as soon as possi-
ble, to prepare for a mission to Eng-
land in the sprlng. I immediately
visited all the Saints upon both islands,
and earnestly exhorted them to sell
their property and prepare to accom-
pany me to Missouri. Several im-
mediately sold, but many were poor. 
Brother [[Nathaniel Thomas|Nathaniel Thomas]] said he
would furnish means to help off all 
the poor Saints who desired to go, 
and for this purpose went with me to
the main land on the 13th, and I 
assisted him in purchasing two thou-
sand dollars worth of horses, harness, 
wagons and tents for the company.
He paid about $1,500 of the expenses 
himself, $1,000 of which went to fur-
nish conveyance for the poor. After
purchasing the outfit for the company, 
I urged the importance of their start-
ing as soon as possible, not later than 
the 1st of September.

August 19âI left the town of 
Camden, where we had prepared our 
outfit, and returned to Scarborough 
to prepare my family for the journey, 
expecting to see the company in a few 
days; but here I remained in great 
suspense until October 1st, when 
Elder [[James Townsend|Townsend]] went to meet the 
company. They arrived in Scar-
borough on the 3rd, with their wagon 
covers flying.

The company stopped at the house
of sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Sarah B. Foss]]. We nailed 
down the covers and painted them,
which made them waterproof.

â4âWe started upon our journey. 
My child was in the first stages of the
whooping-cough. Our company con-
sisted of fifty-three persons; we had
ten wagons, with a pair of horses to
each. We had before us, at this late 
period, a gloomy land journey of two
thousand miles, from Maine to Mis-
souri. We continued to travel through 
rain, mud, cold, frost and snow, until 
we arrived in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]], Sangamon 
county, Illinois, Dec. 19th, where I
stopped and settled my family and 
company for the winter, being unable 
to proceed further. My wife had 
passed through a severe course of the 
brain fever while upon the journey; 
her sufferings had been very great.
Her spirit had left her body twice to
all human appearance, and only been 
called back through the prayer of
faith and the power of God. Our 
child had also been very sick, and I
had become so thoroughly chilled 
through my whole system, in crossing
the bleak prairies, that it was two 
months after I stopped, before I got 
sufficiently warmed to feel natural.

Brother Thomas buried one child, 
and nearly all the company had been 
sick through exposure; some of them 
had stopped by the way.

I spent the winter laboring with my 
hands for the support of my family.

March 8, 1839âI attended a Con-
ference at [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], Illinois.

â13âI took my family and started 
for [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], where I arrived on the 
16th. I dined with [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma Smith]], at
Judge [[John Cleveland|Cleveland's]]. I then went on
to the bank of the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] near Quincy,
and saw a great many of the Saints, 
old and young, lying in the mud and 
water, in a rain storm, without tent
or covering, which suffering was 
caused by the unhallowed persecution
of the State of Missouri. The sight
filled my eyes with tears, while my 
heart was made glad at the cheerful-
ness of the Saints in the midst of their
affliction.

â17 (Sunday)âI had an interview 
with President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and 
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]. We held a meeting 
with the Saints; $50 and a number

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

May 14âI left [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]], and walked 
some thirty miles to [[Holliston, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Holliston]]; staid
at Deacon [[John Haven|Haven's]], and preached. I 
walked to [[Providence, Providence County, Rhode Island|Providence]], R. I., from
thence took steamer to [[New York|New York]], and 
arrived on the 18th. Met and at-
tended meetings with brother [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] 
until the 27th, when I went up the 
North river to [[Newburgh, Orange County, New York|Newburgh]], and preach-
ed in several towns in New York and
[[New Jersey|New Jersey]], and walked across the 
country to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Connecticut, 
and arrived at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] June 11, 
1838.

I commenced preaching at my fa-
ther's house. July 1st, I baptized six 
persons in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]], inclu-
ding my father, [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]] and my
only sister, [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]]; also cousin Seth 
Woodruff, aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna Cossett]] and 
[[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]], a Methodist class 
leader, who was boarding at my fa-
ther's.

When the Patriarch Joseph Smith, 
sen., gave me my blessing, he said
I should bring my father's household
into the kingdom of God, which words 
were fulfilled this day.

I confirmed those baptized, and 
organized this small Branch of the
we safely accomplished amid the re-
flection that time and tide waited for 
no man.

April 4âMr. [[John Kent|Kent]], the post mas-
ter, showed me a letter containing two 
sheets of foolscap, signed by Warren 
Parrish and several of the Twelve, 
who had apostatized and been cut off
from the Church. The communica-
tion was full of slander and falsehoods 
against [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and all that
stood by him. It was sent with the 
intention of breaking up the work 
upon these [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]].

11âI was visited by Elders Town-
send and [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]], who atten-
ded conferences with me upon both
islands, and bore their testimony to
the people, but the spirit of opposition
increased to a great height. I was 
warned by the Spirit of the Lord to 
leave for a season and take a western 
mission. After visiting the Saints 
from house to house, and praying with
and encouraging them, I left on the
28th and went to the main land with 
Elders Townsend and Holmes. Mrs.
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] returned to her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's.]] 
We walked to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]]. I left 
May 7th, and walked to [[Bradford, Penobscot County, Maine|Bradford]], 
where I left Elder Holmes, and pro-
ceeded to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]].

May 11âI gave out an appoint-
ment to preach at sister [[Ruth Daggett Vose Sayers|Vose's]] room, 
and I went to [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] to visit
Elder [[Albert Perry Rockwood|A. P. Rockwood]], who had been
imprisoned in jail on pretence of debt, 
but in reality out of religious persecu-
tion. The jailor locked me in until 
ten p.m.; but while it disappointed a 
congregation of people, it gave me a
happy visit with Elder Rockwood, 
conversing upon the Work of God. 
On my return to Boston the people 
were waiting to hear me; I spoke to
them a short time.

(To be continued.)
of the Methodist church and a priest. 
The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hem-
lock and birch, also gooseberries,
raspberries, whortleberries and upland
cranberries; bushes and timber grow 
out of the crevices of the rocks.

There is a great amount and variety
of fish in the waters around these 
Islands, viz.: whale, black fish, shark,
ground shark, pilot fish, horse
mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, halibut, 
cod, pollock, tomcod, hake, haddock, 
mackerel, shad, bass, alewives, herring,
pohagen, dolphin, whiting, frost fish,
flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, shad, 
cusk, blue backs, scollop, dogfish, 
muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five fin-
gers, monkfish, nursefish, sunfish,
swordfish, thrasher, cat, scuppog, two-
tog, eyefish, cunner, ling eels, lobsters, 
clams, mussels, winkels, porpoises, 
seals, &c.

Sept. 6âThe harbor was filled with 
a school of mackerel, which were
caught in great numbers by the people 
standing upon the wharf.

While standing upon the farm of
[[Ebenezer Carver|Eleazar Carver]] on the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|north island]] I 
counted fifty five islands, many of 
which were inhabited.

Oct. 2âI left the island with Elder 
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]]; Cap. [[Justus Ames|Ames]] took us to Thomas-
town in a sloop.

â3âWe walked forty six miles to 
[[Bath, Sagadahoc County, Maine|Bath]].

â4âWe attended a baptist conven-
tion, and preached to a large congrega-
tion in the evening in [[Pierce's Hall, Bath, Sagadahoc County, Maine|Pierce's hall]]; 
the people listened attentively.

â5âWe walked thirty six miles to 
[[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]].

â6âWalked ten miles to father 
[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]] in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], where I found 
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and friends well.

â9âI parted with Elder Hale, 
who returned to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. I contin-
ued preaching through various towns 
on the main land until Nov. 2, when 
I again returned to [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]], ac-
companied by my wife.

â15âI visited the [[Isle of Holt, Knox County, Maine|Isle of Holt]],
twelve miles east, and preached to an 
attentive congregation, leaving them
the Book of Mormon, which they pro-
mised to read. I returned on the
16th.

I continued my labors during the
winter of 1837-8, and nearly every 
person had attended my meetings, 
and taken sides for or against. Our 
enemies made attempts to break up 
our meetings.

Jan. 15, 1838âA company of 
sailors belonging to the United States
revenue cutter, brought on shore a
swivel and joined the mob, parading
near the house where I was preaching,
and discharged it several times, accom-
panied with small arms, with the in-
tention of breaking up the meeting. 
Some of the mob gathered around to
see what effect this would have. I
warned them in the name of the Lord, 
and proclaimed the judgements of
God that awaited the wicked, and 
shook my garments in the presence of
the people, and told them I was clear 
of their blood; but they only heard 
my voice intermingled with the roar 
of cannon and musketry. Before I
closed speaking, the sailors went back 
on board the revenue cutter. At the 
close of the meeting I baptized two,
also one next day, and while baptiz-
ing, the mob again commenced firing
guns. The Baptists and Methodists 
got up the mob. Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglas]], the 
Methodist Priest, when argument
failed him, applied to all the magis-
trates for warrants against me; they
refused to grant them as he had no
cause of complaint.

Feb. 13âI crossed in the mailboat 
to [[Hampden, Penobscot County, Maine|Hampden]], and ordained James 
Townsend. We walked together
through deep snows, and visited and 
preached in the towns of [[Searsmont, Waldo County, Maine|Searsmont]],
[[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], [[Northport, Waldo County, Maine|Northport]], [[Frankfort, Waldo County, Maine|Frankfort]], Hamp-
den, and twice in the city hall in Ban-
gor, to large assemblies, and returned
to Fox Islands via Casteem and the
Isle of Holt. Arrived in [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]]
March 8. Elder Townsend returned
home.

March 22âI accompanied brother 
[[Cyrus Starrett|Stirrat]], at low tide, on to a bar some 
forty rods from shore, to dig some 
clams. We were soon joined by Mrs. 
Woodruff and sister [[Sarah Stone|Stone]], who had a 
curiosity to see how clams were dug. 
The ground for about twelve rods
nearer shore was several feet lower
than the point we were on, but we
were so busily engaged we did not 
observe the flowing tide until we were 
surrounded by water, and having no 
boat, our only alternative was to wade
ashore and carry the women, which

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

I followed Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglas]] to his own
[[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|island]], and commenced preaching to
his church, and baptized a good share 
of his members, among whom were
several sea captains. Ministers from 
the main land were sent for, who
came over and tried to put a stop to
the work, by preaching and lying
about us; but the work continued to 
roll on. They wished me to work a
miracle to convince them that my doc-
trine was true. I told them they had 
rejected the truth, and they would 
see signs, but not unto salvation.

[[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]], which includes both 
[[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|north]] and south Fox Island, is in lat.
44Â°, long. 69Â°10'. The inhabitants 
are generally healthy and industrious, 
and hospitable to strangers, the people 
obtain most of their wealth by fishing, 
and fit out annually over one hundred 
licensed vessels, beside many smaller 
crafts. The north island is nine miles
long and two wide; population 800, 
and contains a post office, a store, 
a grist mill, four school houses, and a 
Baptist church. The land is rocky 
and rough, yet there are farms which 
produce good wheat, barley, oats, 
potatoes and grass; the principal
timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and 
birch. The rasp and gooseberry grow
in great abundance. Sheep are the
principal stock.

South Fox island is about ten miles
long and five wide, and is a mass of
rocks, principally granite, formed into 
shelves, hills, hollows, and cut up into 
nooks, points and ravines by coves
and harbors; population 1000. There
are some small patches under cultiva-
tion, at the expense of great labor and 
toil. Many resident fishermen fish at 
[[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and bring them home, 
and dry them upon flakes; they annu-
ally supply the market with a great
amount of codfish, mackerel and 
boxed herring. The latter island 
contains two stores, three tide saw 
mills, six school houses, a small branch
up into the pulpit, and took a seat o n 
each side of him. When he closed his
discourse, he asked me what hour we 
would like to speak; I told him at
five; he gave out our appointment, 
and invited us to his house. I asked 
him how many school houses were on 
the Island; he said four, and gave me 
their names. I asked him if they 
were free for any one to preach in; he
answered in the affirmative. I took
out my Bible, Book of Mormon, and 
Doctrine and covenants, and laid them 
all upon his stand; he promised to
read them. The hour of meeting arri-
ved, and I preached to a full house 
upon the first principles of the Gospel, 
and bore testimony that the Lord had
raised up a prophet, and had com-
menced to establish his church and 
Kingdom again upon the earth, in
fulfilment of his word, as spoken 
through the ancient Prophets and 
Apostles. This was the first discourse
ever delivered by any Latter-day 
Saint upon this chain of islands;
Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] bore testimony. I gave
out appointments for preaching in
the four school houses. The people 
came out in masses to investigate the 
principles which we taught. In four-
teen days we preached nineteen dis-
courses. Capt. [[Justus Ames|Justice Ames]] and 
[[Betsey Hudson Ames|wife]] were baptized by Elder Hale.
Elder [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], the Baptist minister, 
with his family attended twelve of our 
meetings, read the books, and was 
convinced by the spirit of the Lord 
that our doctrine was true, and he
had a hard struggle in his mind to 
know which to do, receive or reject it; 
he finally resolved to reject it, and 
commenced preaching against us. He
sent for Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglass]], Methodist
minister, on the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]], to come 
and help him; he had been long at 
variance with Mr. Douglass, but they 
became very friendly and united in a
war against us. We continued preach-
ing daily, until we baptized most of 
the members of Mr. Newton's church,
and those who owned the meeting 
house.

(To be continued.)
with his rabble, and asked many ques-
tions; he said I had no right to my 
opinion, and no man had a right to
preach the gospel unless he had a 
collegiate education. I told him I
would admit that point, when he would
tell me at what college Jesus Christ
and his Apostles obtained their educa-
tion: the priest and rabble then 
left.

â12âI preached in a school house 
in [[West Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|West Avon]] to an attentive congre-
gation; after meeting I baptized my
uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]], his [[Acksah Merrill Woodruff|wife]] and 
son, [[John Woodruff|John]], in fulfilment of a dream 
which I had at ten years of age.

I visited most of my relatives in 
Conn., and preached the Gospel to 
them.

â16âI preached at [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart's]]
in [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], where I was met by my step-
mother and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]], also by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]], 
who had travelled alone from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], 
and was on her way to visit her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father]]
in [[Maine|Maine]].

â19âElder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] went to New
Rowley, Mass., to visit his friends. 
I had been solicited to preach to the
citizens of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] by many promi-
nent men, but every room which was 
offered me, including the town hall, 
was closed against me by the Rev.
[[Noah Porter|Noah Porter]], pastor of the Presby-
terian church, until the Methodist
church was offered me, which he had
not influence to close. Two hours 
after I gave out the appointment, the 
house was filled, and I preached to a
very attentive congregation, including 
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and his household, for an 
hour and a half, upon the first princi-
ples of the Gospel; I gave liberty to
the assembly to ask any questions, or
find any fault with what I had said, 
but I met with no opposition.

â20âI left my father's house, and, 
with my wife, rode by stage to Hart-
ford.

â21âNot having money to pay
the fare for us both, I paid her fare in
the stage to New Rowley, Mass., and
I walked through a hot sultry day
fifteen hours, averaging three and a
half miles per hour, making 52
miles.

â22âI walked 48 miles.

â23âI walked 36 miles, and ar-
rived at Elder [[Nathaniel Holmes|Nathaniel Holme's]], in 
New Rowley, at two o'clock, p.m., 
making 136 miles in a little over two 
days and a half. I met with my wife
and Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]], at his 
father's house: I spent several days 
in preaching to the Saints in that 
region.

Aug. 1âWe left New Rowley, and 
was joined by Elder Hale, who accom-
panied us to [[Saco, York County, Maine|Saco]], Maine.

â7âI accompanied my wife to her
father's in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], Maine. We 
were kindly received: it was the first 
time I had seen any of her relations. 
We found mother [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Carter]] very sick. 
I spent several days visiting the Saints
in that region.

â10âI accompanied [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra]] and 
[[Fabyan Carter|Fabien Carter]], my brothers-in-law, 
on a fishing excursion; we caught
with hooks 250 codfish, haddock, and 
hake, and saw four whales; it being
the first time I had ever seen that 
class of fish that swallowed Jonah.

â18âWith Elder Hale, I started
to fill my mission on [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]]; we 
walked to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]], and spent the 
night at Mr. [[Samuel Hale|Samuel Hale's]].

â19âWe took the steamer Bangor 
85 miles to [[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owl's Head]], where we 
arrived at sunset, without means to
prosecute our journey further. We 
retired to a high hill, and bowed 
before the Lord, and prayed that he
would open our way; the spirit of the
Lord rested upon us, and testified 
unto us that our prayers would be 
answered. As we arose from our
knees, a sloop came into the harbor; 
we went to the captain, and enquired 
where he was going; he replied, 
through the channel of [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]]; 
he took us on board and landed us on
[[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Fox Islands]], at 2 a.m. on the
20th. We wandered in the dark about
an hour, rambling over rocks and 
bushes, found the house of Mr. Natha-
niel Dyer, and were entertained. It
being Sunday morning, Mr. Benjamin 
Kent piloted us to the Baptist meet-
ing-house, occupied by Elder Gideon
J. Newton, pastor of the only religious 
denomination upon the Island. At 
the door, I sent for the deacon, and
told him I wished him to inform the
minister that we were servants of God,
and wished to deliver a message to
that people. The minister sent word 
for us to come into the pulpit; accord-
ingly, with valise in hand, we walked

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

May 5âWhile laboring for Joseph 
Young, [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] was visited with a 
sudden storm of wind and rain, a cur-
rent passed south of the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]] in the 
form of a whirlwind or tornado, which
destroyed and injured several build-
ings, it crushed one of Joseph Young's 
buildings, and removed the one we 
were in some 10 feet, but no person 
was injured.

I felt impressed to go out upon a
mission; the Spirit was upon me, and 
led me to go to [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]]; it was a
country I had never visited. I named
my feelings upon the subject to Elders
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]], [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] and others; they 
encouraged me to go. Elder Kimball 
blessed me, and said in the name of 
the Lord, I should be blessed and 
prospered on my mission, and do a 
good work. I proposed to Jonathan 
H. Hale to accompany me, which he 
did.

May 31âI left my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and friends 
in Kirtland, and walked to [[Fairport Harbor, Lake County, Ohio|Fairport]] 
with brother Hale; we were joined by
[[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]], and took the steamer 
Sandusky and arrived in [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]], June 
1st, and [[Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York|Syracuse]] on the 4th; walked
36 miles to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richmond]] [Richland], Oswego county, 
New York, and called upon my two 
brothers, [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] and [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thomson]], whom 
I had not seen for several years. We 
visited the churches as far as Sackett's 
Harbor, called upon Archibald
Patten, and delivered to him some 
letters from [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parish]], in which 
were enclosed many one hundred
dollar bills, which he had taken from
the [[Kirtland Safety Society Bank, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland Bank]].

We crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]], visited
Upper [[Canada, British North America|Canada]], and attended a confe-
rence, May 10th, with Elders John E. 
Page and [[James Blakesley|James Blakesly]], in the 
township of [[Bastard, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Bastard]], Leeds County. 
There were eight branches represented, 
containing 300 members. 13 Elders, 
5 Priests, 8 Teachers and 6 Deacons. 
Elder [[William Draper|William Draper]] and myself 
ordained 7 Elders, 9 Priests, 11 Teach-
ers, and 5 Deacons: five were baptized
by Elder Page at the close of the Con-
ference.

A woman was possessed of the devil 
and greatly afflicted, much of the time 
was dumb; four of us laid hands upon
her, and cast the devil out in the 
name of Jesus Christ, and she was 
made whole, and gave thanks unto
God, and went on her way rejoic-
ing.

We visited several other Branches 
and preached the word of God, and
several of the sick were healed.

We returned to [[Kingston, Frontenac County, Canada West, British North America|Kingston]], took 
steamer for [[Oswego, Oswego County, New York|Oswego]], and canal for
[[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]]; Brothers [[John Goodson|John Goodson]], 
[[Isaac Russell|Isaac Russel]] and [[John Snider|John Snider]] accom-
panied us from Canada, and left us at 
[[Schenectady, Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]], to join Elders Kimball,
[[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] and [[Willard Richards|Richards]] at New York, to
go to [[England|England]].

We walked from Albany to Farm-
ington, Conn.; attended a conference 
of the Saints in [[Canaan, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Canaan]]; arrived at
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house July 6th. This was 
the first time I had seen my father or 
relatives in Conn., since I joined the 
Church; they received me kindly.
On the 10th, I preached in the City
Hall in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Colinsville]], and a mob gather-
ed and attempted to break up the
meeting, with fife and drum, holloa-
ing and yelling; they were urged on
by a Presbyterian priest. At the close 
of the meeting the priest came to me
many of the gifts were poured out
upon the people; at break of day we
were dismissed.

I also spent the night of the 7th in
the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]], with several of the Elders, 
in prayer and praise before the Lord; 
the Holy Ghost rested upon us, and 
the spirit of prophecy was given, and
many things were shown by the holy 
Spirit.

April 9âPresident [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Smith]] spoke in
the afternoon, and said in the name 
of the Lord, that the judgments of
God would rest upon those men who 
had professed to be his friends, and
friends of humanity, and in building 
up Kirtland, a stake of Zion, but had 
turned traitors to him, and the inter-
ests of the kingdom of God, and had 
given power into the hands of our 
enemies against us; they had oppressed
the poor Saints, and had brought dis-
tress upon them, and had become 
covenant-breakers, for which they will 
feel the wrath of God.

April 13, 1837âI married Phebe 
W. Carter, daughter of [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Ezra]] and 
[[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Sarah Carter]], of [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], Maine. 
The ceremony was performed at the
house of President Joseph Smith, by
[[Frederick Granger Williams|Fred. G. Williams]], Esq. The Pro-
phet Joseph appointed to marry us,
but his life was sought by a mob, and
he had to flee.

â15âI received my patriarchal bles-
sing under the hands of the Patriarch, 
[[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith, sen.]]; my wife having
received her patriarchal blessing pre-
viously.

 (To be continued.)
â29âPresidents [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and 
[[Oliver Cowdery|O. Cowdery]] addressed the Saints in
the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]]. Joseph blessed the peo-
ple in the name of the Lord, and said,
if we would be faithful, we should
arise above our embarrassments, and 
be delivered from the hands of our 
enemies.

â30âI wrote an article on faith,
which was published in the Messenger
and Advocate.

Feb. 19âI attended meeting at the
Temple. President Joseph Smith had
been absent on business for the Church,
but not half as long as Moses was in 
the mount away from Israel; yet
many of the people in Kirtland, if 
they did not make a calf to worship,
as did the Israelites, turned their 
hearts away from the Lord, and from 
his servant Joseph, and had engaged 
in speculation, and given way to 
false spirits, until they were darkened 
in their minds; and many were op-
posed to Joseph Smith, and some 
wished to appoint [[David Whitmer|David Whitmer]] to
lead the Church in his stead. In the
midst of this cloud of dark spirits,
Joseph returned to Kirtland, and this 
morning arose in the stand. He ap-
peared much depressed; but soon the 
Spirit of God rested upon him, and he 
addressed the assembly in great plain-
ness for about three hours, and put
his enemies to silence. When he arose
he said, "I am still the President, 
Prophet, Seer, Revelator and Leader
of the Church of Jesus Christ. God, 
and not man, has appointed and 
placed me in this position, and no man
or set of men have power to remove 
me, or appoint another in my stead;
and those who undertake this, if they
do not speedily repent, will burn their 
fingers and go to hell." He reproved
the people sharply for their sins, dark-
ness and unbelief. The power of God
rested upon him, and bore testimony 
that his sayings were true.

March 23rd was spent in the Temple
by the Saints in Kirtland, in fasting
and prayer. Patriarch Joseph Smith, 
sen., presided. The Spirit of the 
Lord was poured out upon the people.
A contribution was taken up for the
poor.

April 4âI received my washings 
and anointings in the house of the
Lord. I spent the whole night in the
Temple, with others of the Seventies, 
in prayer and fasting; the Spirit of 
the Lord rested upon us. After
twenty-four hours I partook of food.

â6âThe Presidency of the Church, 
the Twelve Apostles, and other Quo-
rums, met in solemn assembly, and 
sealed upon our heads our washings,
anointings and blessings, with a loud 
shout of hosannah to God and the 
Lamb; the Spirit of the Lord rested
upon us. After spending three hours
in the upper room, the Quorums re-
paired to the lower court; the vails 
were lowered, and the ordinance of
washing of feet was administered.
Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] washed my feet, 
and pronounced blessings upon me.
After this ordinance, the vails of the
Temple were rolled up, and President 
Joseph Smith addressed the Elders for 
three hours, clothed with the Spirit
and power of God. He unbosomed 
his feelings in the house of his friends,
and gave much instruction. He urged
upon us the absolute necessity of 
giving strict heed to his teachings and 
counsel, and the revelations of the 
Lord to the Church, and be wise in 
all things, that Zion and her stakes
may be redeemed and established, no
more to be thrown down. He said,
that the kings of the earth would yet 
come to behold the glory of Zion, and
that great and glorious blessings would
be bestowed upon the Saints in the 
last days. [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] bore testi-
mony, and was followed by Oliver 
Cowdery, who exhorted the Elders to
keep within the bounds of their know-
ledge, and let the mysteries of the 
kingdom alone, for the Gentiles had
not a knowledge even of the first 
principles of the Gospel. He said, it
is far better to preach what the people 
would call the small things of the
kingdom, than to enter into the visions 
of Isaiah, Ezekiel and John. The 
Twelve broke bread, which was distri-
buted to the multitude, who eat and 
were filled; thanks were returned, 
and the meeting closed at the setting 
of the sun.

The house was again filled at candle 
light. President Smith requested the 
Elders to speak their feelings freely, 
and sing, exhort and pray, as the Spi-
rit should give utterance. The meet-
ing continued during the whole night;

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

Oct. 20âIn company with A. O. 
Smoot and [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpin]], I started for 
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]; this was the first time I 
had ever travelled on a steamboat. 
We left the steamer at [[Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky|Louisville]], on
the 28th, and spent nineteen days
visiting Elder Smoot's relations, and 
preaching among the people; we visi-
ted the [[Big Bone Lick, Boone County, Kentucky|Big Bone Lick]]. We arrived 
in [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnatti]], Nov. 17th, where we
saw thirteen persons dead and 
wounded, taken from the steamer 
Flora, which had burst her pipes
while running a race; arrived in Kirt-
land on the 25th, and had the happy 
privilege of meeting the Prophet 
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], and many Elders with whom 
I was acquainted in the Camp of Zion.

â29âI heard Joseph preach in the
[[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]]. In the afternoon I was 
called to speak, and read the 56th 
chap. of Isaiah, and made some re-
marks, and gave an account of my 
mission in the south; Elder Smoot 
also addressed the Saints.

I was counselled by the Presidency
to attend the school in the Temple, 
taught by Professor [[H. M. Hawes|Haws]]. I studied 
the Latin language and English gram-
mar, and boarded with brother Ira 
Bond.

I attended meetings with the Seven-
ties and other Quorums, during the 
winter of 1836-7, and received much 
valuable instruction.

Dec. 20, 1836âI was present at the
organization of the Third Quorum of 
the Seventies; there were twenty-
seven ordained.

Jan. 3, 1837âI was set apart to 
be a member of the First Quorum of
Seventies.

â25âAt early candle light, a cloud
began to arise in the north-east, and 
reached to the north-west, having the
appearance of fire, and it soon spread
over the whole horizon. The reflec-
tion of the clouds upon the earth, 
which was covered with snow, had 
a blood-red appearance. It com-
menced at about 6 o'clock, and lasted
till past 10 p.m.
with a high circulation of blood and
blistered hands; but our horses leapt
the bank, and we went on our way to
the [[Sandy River, Tennessee|Sandy]], which we swam, and spent 
the night at [[Thomas Frazier|Thomas Frazer's]].

â30âWe preached at Mr. David 
Crider's, also on Sunday the 31st, 
where we were threatened by a mob.
I baptized Mr. Crider amid the scoffs 
of the rabble, who went in the night 
and poisoned both of our horses; the 
one which I rode, belonging to brother
[[Samuel Walker West|Samuel West]], died in two days after-
wards; brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot's]] recovered; 
the swine that eat of the horse flesh 
also died.

Aug. 11âI met with [[David Wyman Patten|D. W. Patten]] 
and [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|wife]]; he and brother [[Warren Farr Parrish|Parrish]] had 
been driven out of [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton]] into Henry
county, and Elder Parrish had left for
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]].

â29âWe were visited by Elders 
[[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|T. B. Marsh]] and [[Elisha Hurd Groves|E. H. Groves]], from 
[[Caldwell County, Missouri|Caldwell county]], Mo.

Sept. 2âWe held a Conference at 
[[Damon Creek, Calloway County, Kentucky|Damon's Creek]], Callaway county, 
Kentucky; several Branches were re-
presented, containing 119 members. 
[[Johnston F. Lane|Johnson F. Lane]], [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin L. Clapp]], 
and [[Randolph Alexander|Randolph Alexander]], were or-
dained Elders, and [[Lindsey Anderson Brady|Lindsey Bradey]] a 
priest, by D. W. Patten, who baptized 
five at the close of the Conference.

I was released from my labors in 
the south, and counselled to go to 
Kirtland and receive my endowments,
as was also A. O. Smoot.

Sept. 19âElders Marsh and D. W. 
Patten and wife, and E. H. Groves,
started for [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]]. I organized 
the first company of Saints who emi-
grated from the Southern States, which 
numbered twenty-two souls. I ap-
pointed Elder [[Benjamin Boydston|Boydston]] President of 
the company, and counselled them to 
be united, and to remember their 
prayers night and day before the 
Lord.

â20âThe camp started. I spent 
a few days visiting the Branches; bap-
tized and confirmed eight, and ob-
tained thirty subscribers for the
Messenger and Advocate.

(To be continued.)(Continued from page 232.)

HISTORY 
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

June 19âA States warrant was 
issued against [[David Wyman Patten|D. W. Patten]], Warren
Parrish and Wilford Woodruff, sworn 
out by [[Matthew Williams|Matthew Williams]], a Metho-
dist priest, and served by the sheriff, 
[[Robert Cowan Petty|Robert C. Petty]]. Elders Patten and 
Parrish were taken by an armed mob 
of about fifty, under pretence of law,
led by the sheriff, a colonel, first and 
second major, with other officers, and 
a Methodist priest with a gun upon his 
shoulder. I was in another county, 
and therefore not taken. We were
accused of prophesying falsely, by 
saying that four persons who were 
baptized should receive the Holy
Ghost in twenty-four hours, and that 
Christ should come the second time
before this generation passed away. 
The whole concern was a mob mock 
trial, contrary to law, justice, judg-
ment or truth.

On the 29th, I went to a Baptist
meeting-house, on [[Thompson Creek, Weakley County, Tennessee|Thompson's creek]], 
to preach; the house was crowded. 
As I rose to speak, a Baptist priest, 
Mr. [[Parson Browning|Browning]], arrived at the door on 
horseback, and stepped in greatly 
agitated, and told the deacon to forbid 
my preaching in the house, at the
same time commenced a tirade of 
abuse against the "Mormons," telling
several lies, which I corrected before
the people, which increased his rage.
As I was forbidden to preach in the 
house, and had been invited, and tra-
velled many miles to fulfil my ap-
pointment, I told the people I would
like to preach, and was willing to 
stand on a wood pile, a fence, a cart, 
or any place they would appoint. A 
man rose and said he owned the land 
in front of the meeting-house, and I 
might stand and preach on that, and
welcome. All the congregation, with
the exception of the minister and one
deacon, arose and left the house, 
walked across the street, and formed 
seats of a worm fence, and gave good
attention while I preached for an hour 
and-a-half, on the principles of the
Gospel.

When I closed, Mr. Randolph Alex-
ander, who had never heard a "Mor-
mon" Elder speak before, said, the 
people of the present day made him
think of a pen of hogs; the keeper
would make a trough, and pour into
it hot or cold water, dish water, or 
anything else, and they would drink 
it; but let a stranger come along, and 
pour over a basket of corn on the back 
side of the pen, and the hogs would 
be frightened, and run and snort all 
over the pen. He said it was so with 
the people; the priests would feed
them with any kind of doctrine, no 
matter how false, the people will 
swallow it down; but let a stranger
come and preach the Gospel of Jesus
Christ, which will save the people, as 
Mr. Woodruff has done, and the peo-
ple are afraid of him.

Mr. Alexander invited me home,
bought a Book of Mormon, and was
soon baptized, and several others
followed his example.

July 14âI wrote a letter to Oliver 
Cowdery, and sent him a list of sub-
scribers for the Messenger and Advocate, 
and a detail of my mission in the south.

â18âI rode in company with A. 
O. Smoot to a ferry on the Tennessee 
river. The ferryman was absent. 
We were offered the use of the boat, 
and ferried ourselves; but not being
much used to the business, and losing
one oar in the river, and having to
row with a broken oar, we landed a 
great distance below the usual place,
[[Henry Thomas|Thomas]], at nine o'clock, all safe, hav-
ing rode twenty miles, five hours in 
the storm, and we felt to thank the
Lord for our preservation.

During the winter and spring, I 
continued to labor mostly alone, 
through [[Kentucky|Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], 
opening new places, preaching daily, 
baptizing, confirming, and organizing 
new Branches.

Feb. 26, 1836âAt a Conference 
held at Brother [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|B. L. Clapp's]], in
[[Calloway County, Kentucky|Callaway county]], Kentucky, I or-
dained [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] and Benjamin 
Boydston, Elders, and B. L. Clapp 
and [[Daniel Thomas|Daniel Thomas]], Priests.

Brothers Smoot and Clapp both
entered into the labors of the ministry. 
Elder Smoot frequently accompanied
me on my mission. Elder D. W. 
Patten returned to Tennessee in 
April, and joined us in our labors, 
accompanied by his [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|wife]]. It was a
happy meeting. He related to me
the blessings he had received in Kirt-
land during the endowments. We 
travelled and labored together; perse-
cution raged against us. Elder Pat-
ten bore a strong and forcible testi-
mony of the Work of God; and when 
we were opposed by mobs, he would 
rebuke them in great plainness; we 
were threatened, but not injured. The
sick were healed under our admini-
strations.

May 27âElder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] 
arrived from Kirtland. We held a 
Conference on the 28th, at brother
[[Seth Utley|Seth Utley's]]. Seven Branches were 
represented, containing 116 members. 
[[Abel B. Wilson|Abel Wilson]] and [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpin]] were 
ordained Priests, and [[Albert Petty|Albert Petty]] a 
Teacher.

â31âI was ordained by David 
W. Patten, a member of the Second 
Quorum of Seventies.

We labored over a circuit of several
hundred miles. Brother Smoot la-
bored with us, and brother Clapp
frequently. We travelled two by two, 
and all met together to hold Confe-
rences.

(To be continued.)
visiting [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little Rock]], we travelled down 
the [[Arkansas River, United States|river]] ten miles, and tied up our 
canoe on the east bank, and stopped
with Mr. Jones. I preached next day 
at his house. On the 16th we left our 
canoe with Mr. Jones, and walked 
back up the river ten miles, opposite
Little Rock, and took the old military
road, and started to wade the Missis-
sippi swamp, which was mostly cov-
ered with water from Little Rock, 
Arkansas, to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee, a 
distance of about 175 miles. We
waded through mud and water knee 
deep, day after day, and in some in-
stances forty miles per day, before we 
could get a stopping place.

On the 24th, while in the swamps, 
I had an attack of the rheumatism, and 
could not travel fast. My companion,
brother [[Henry Brown|Brown]], had got in a hurry, 
and wished to return to his family in 
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]; and as I could not travel as 
fast as he wished, we parted. He 
left me sitting on a log in the mud
and water; I was lame and unable to 
walk, without food, and twelve miles 
from the nearest house on the road. 
He went out of sight in great haste.
I then knelt down in the water, and
prayed to the Lord to heal me. The 
Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, 
and I was healed; the pain left me; 
I arose and went my way. Whenever
I met with one or more families, I
preached and bore testimony to them.

I crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] in the 
evening of the 27th of March, and 
stayed at a public house kept by Mr.
[[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]]. I was suspected of
being an impostor. Mr. Jackson 
believed I was one of [[John Andrews Murrell|Murril's]] clan, 
who were then murdering and steal-
ing negroes; and to test me, he 
gathered together a large house full 
of the most wicked and corrupt peo-
ple in the city, and set me to preach-
ing, to see whether I could preach or 
not.

I do not think that Mr. Jackson, or 
the same company of men and women, 
will ever meet together again for the 
same purpose, for they would not like 
again to have their sins and abomina-
tions revealed to each other as point-
edly as I told them that night, through 
the inspiration of the Holy Ghost;
they were glad to get rid of me upon
almost any terms.

I travelled from Memphis to Middle 
Tennessee.

April 4âI met with Elder Warren 
Parrish, in [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton county]]. He and 
[[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]] had labored together 
through the winter in Tennessee, and 
baptized twenty persons. Elder Pat-
ten had returned to Kirtland. I 
joined Elder Parrish, and we labored 
together over three months, travelling
and preaching daily; baptizing such
as would receive our testimony; ex-
tending our labors in Tennessee and 
[[Kentucky|Kentucky]].

June 23âWe received a letter from 
[[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdery]], requesting Elder
Parrish to come to Kirtland, and for
me to remain and take charge of the
southern churches, and the Lord would 
bless me in so doing.

June 28âWarren Parrish ordained 
me an Elder. We baptized some forty 
persons while laboring together.

July 23âElder Parrish left. I 
travelled alone through the year, and
extended my labors both in Kentucky 
and Tennessee. I baptized forty-three
persons during this season, thirty-one
after brother Parrish left.

Nov. 15âWhile travelling in the
night, with brother [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin L. Clapp]] 
and others, a tremendous storm of 
wind and rain overtook us. We came 
to a creek which had swollen to such 
an extent by the rain, that we could 
not cross without swimming our 
horses; several of the company were 
females. We undertook to head the 
stream, to ford it; but in the attempt,
in the midst of the darkness and the
raging of the wind and rain, we were
lost in the thick woods, amidst the
rain, wind, creeks and fallen tree-
tops. We crossed streams nearly
twenty times. I was reminded of
Paul's perils by water; but the Lord
was merciful unto us in the midst of
our troubles, for while we were grop-
ing in the dark, running the risk of 
killing both ourselves and animals, 
by riding off precipitous bluffs, a 
bright light suddenly shone round 
about us, and revealed our perilous 
situation, as we were upon the edge of 
a deep gulf. The light continued with
us until we found a house, and learned 
the right road; then the light dis-
appeared, and we were enabled to
reach the house of brother [[Henry Thomas|Henry]]

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

March 2âWe cut down a large 
cotton-wood tree, and in two days
dug out a canoe four feet wide and 
twelve long, put on a pair of oars, 
and then rowed down the Arkansas
river, 125 miles, to [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little Rock]], beg-
ging our food by the way, a meal at a
time, as we had opportunity. After
When I had got a few rods from his 
door, [[Alexander Akeman|he]] was nearly treading on my
heels, and fell dead at my feet, as
though he had been struck with light-
ning; he swelled, and immediately 
turned black. This created a great
wailing and mourning among his 
family. Brother [[Henry Brown|Brown]] and myself 
assisted in laying him out and burying
him. He died Feb. 14, 1835.

This singular dispensation of Provi-
dence brought solemnity upon the 
people, and they began to reflect and 
wished to hear preaching. We held
several meetings and preached, and
baptized Mr. [[Jonathan Hubbel|Hubbel]] and his [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|wife]], 
who had opened their doors and given 
us a home; and just as we had got 
the people prepared to receive the
Gospel and anxious to learn, and plead-
ing with us to stay and preach, bro-
Brown resolved that he would con-
tinue his journey south. I was fully 
satisfied that should we stop, we 
would built up a Church, and was
convinced it was our duty to stop; 
but brother Brown held the office of
an Elder, and I submitted.

Brother Brown did not baptize ano-
ther person on the mission.

(To be continued.)
Saints, and had lately moved here, 
depending upon his gun mostly for 
his living. It was sixty miles to a
house on the north, and twelve miles
on the south. [[Mr. Williams|He]] and his family were 
living in a small old log hut, about 
twelve feet square, and one bed in the
room, upon which lay his wife, several
children and three young dogs. He 
lay stretched out upon the bare floor, 
with his feet to a small fire. There 
was no door to the house, but a rag-
ged quilt hung up in the door way; it 
was past eleven o'clock at night. I 
turned away the quilt, looked into the
house, and spoke three times; no one
stirred, not even a dog. I walked in, 
and laid my hands upon the man's 
shoulder, and spoke to him. The mo-
ment he felt the weight of my hand, 
he leaped to his feet, and commenced 
running around the room, leaping as 
high as he could each jump. I told 
him not to be frightened, as we were 
travellers and friends, and did not
wish to hurt him, but wished to stop 
with him over night. When he came 
to his senses, he gave us permission to 
stop with him till morning, if we 
would take the bare floor, as he did. 
We asked for something to eat, as we 
had walked sixty miles without a
morsel of food. He replied, he had 
nothing for us, and assured us he had 
to kill game for his breakfast in the
morning. He informed us that the
reason of his fright, was in conse-
quence of his having shot a large pan-
ther, a few nights previous, standing
in his door, and he thought his mate 
had lit upon him. We lay down upon 
the floor, and we were glad of this
place, as it soon began to rain, and 
rained through the night.

In the morning we arose, and went 
on in the rain twelve miles, to a Mr. 
Conner's, who was also in the Jackson
county mob. He gave us breakfast, 
but damned us while we were eating, 
because we were "Mormons." When
we had finished a hearty breakfast,
we thanked him very politely, and
went on our way, leaving him swear-
ing. We felt thankful for breakfast, 
for we had walked seventy-two miles 
without eating food. We taught from 
house to house as we journeyed.

Jan. 24âI preached at Mr. Nathan
Tanner's, in [[Greene County, Missouri|Green county]], Missouri, 
the first time we had found a congre-
gation we could preach to in safety,
and the first time that I had ever 
attempted to preach as a missionary. 
I had great liberty, and was followed
by Elder [[Henry Brown|Brown]]. During our preach-
ing, there was a snow storm.

We arrived at [[Cedar Creek, Petit Jean, Conway County, Arkansas Territory|Petty John Creek]], in 
Arkansas, where Mr. Alexander Ake-
man resided, with a large family of 
[[William Akeman|son]]s and [[Delilah Adaline Akeman Gibbs|one daughter]], settled around 
him. Mr. Akeman, and a part of the 
family, were members of the Church
in Jackson county; [[Prudence Stockton Akeman|his wife]] died
strong in the faith in Missouri. His
whole family were mobbed, and some
of [[Wright Akeman|his son]]s were whipped severely;
but he could not stand the persecution 
and the loss of his property. He
moved to Arkansas, to get rid of 
"Mormonism," had apostatized, and 
was bitter against the Work. When
we called upon him, he opposed us 
stronglyâspoke against the leaders of 
the Church and the Book of Mormon. 
He had one son who received us, and 
had a little faith. I dreamed the 
night before, that we were required to
walk in a straight, narrow path; and 
while following the path, it led to the
door of a house, which was placed in
a high wall that we could not get
around. As I opened the door to go 
through, I saw the room was filled 
with large serpents. I entered, and 
they all coiled up to jump at me; as 
they made a spring to bite me, they
all fell dead at my feet, turned black, 
swelled up, burst open, took fire, and 
were consumed before my eyes.

We met with much opposition from 
Mr. Akeman, and many in the neigh-
borhood. Elder Brown wished to 
leave the place immediately. I told 
him I should stay, and see my dream
fulfilled. We staid in the neighbor-
hood twenty-five days, during which
time the Lord brought judgment upon
those who threatened to mob and kill 
us; many of them died suddenly, and
I was warned three times by the Lord, 
to go to Mr. Akeman, and bear testi-
mony unto him of the truth of "Mor-
monism," and the wickedness of his 
course in opposing it; and the last 
time I called upon him, he was filled 
with wrath against me, and when I 
left his house, he followed me in a
rage, apparently with some evil intent.

WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

June [January] 19âMr. [[Michael Geraud|Jerrew]] gave us a 
good breakfast, put us across the Osage 
river in a canoe, and we started upon 
our long day's walk, it being sixty 
miles to the nearest house. We had
not anything with us to eat. Most of 
our travels through the day was
through prairie; before dark we en-
tered timbered land; as we approached 
the timber, a large black bear met us; 
we had no weapons. When the bear got
within about six rods of us, he rose upon
his hind feet, and examined us a short 
time, and went off. We were soon
enveloped in such thick darkness, that 
it was with great difficulty we could 
keep the road, and surrounded by a
large drove of wolves, which kept up 
a continual howling, and would fre-
quently rush to within a few feet of us. 
We travelled about two hours in this 
situation, feeling that we were in 
danger, and concluded to stop and 
build a fire, and wait till morning.
Accordingly, we built a large fire,
which drove the wolves off; and as 
we were about to lie down, we heard
a dog bark, and a bell. We felt 
assured we were near a house; both 
of us took a brand of fire, and on going 
about one quarter of a mile, we came 
to a log hut, which was occupied by 
[[Mr. Williams|Mr. Williams]], who had been in Jack-
son county during the mobbing of the
were having a pow-wow. As we ap-
proached, we were met by a dozen 
large savage looking dogs; they smelt
us in a friendly manner, but did not 
attempt to bite nor bark. We ar-
rived about midnight, covered with 
mud, hungry and weary, and were
kindly received and entertained for 
the remainder of the night by Mr. 
[[Michael Geraud|Jerrew]], who had an Osage squaw for 
a wife; she prepared us a good supper,
but marvelled that we did not drink 
coffee. She proffered us their best
bed, which was highly ornamented, 
but we declined her kind offer, as we
were wet and muddy. She made us a
good bed of mackinaw blankets, before
a large fire, and we slept comfortably. 
May the Lord reward both Mr. Jerrew 
and wife, and the Presbyterian mini-
ster, according their deserts.

WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

June [January] 18âWe called at the Har-
mony mission, and had an interview 
with the President, a Presbyterian
minister. Although it was near sun-
down, he would neither give us any-
thing to eat, nor lodge us, because we 
were "Mormons." It was fifteen
miles to the nearest house, which was 
[[Michael Geraud|Jerrew's]] Indian trading house. We 
asked the minister to direct us there.
He gave us directions, but the Spirit 
said to me he was deceiving us. I 
asked him three times, and he declared 
he was telling us the truth. We 
followed his directions, and we came
to the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage river]] swamp, where we 
were lost in the darkness of the night. 
We followed the river, but as it is 
very crooked, we made but little pro-
gress. After travelling through mud 
and water for one hour, we concluded
to go out on the open prairie, and lie 
down in the grass until morning; but 
when we got out into the prairie, we
heard the Osage Indians' drum and
shout at the trading house, as they
according to the law of God. He 
answered, that he had not faith enough
to start on a mission through Jackson 
county without money, and if I did it, 
I must do it on my own faith. I felt 
strenuous to keep the commandments, 
so I started without money. I called 
upon Elder [[Harry Brown|Harry Brown]], and asked
him to accompany me; he consented, 
and Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] appointed him 
to go with me.

Jan. 13, 1835âI received an honor-
able discharge from [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]],
certifying that I had faithfully per-
formed my duties in Zion's Camp.

I took my valise in hand, weighing
15 lbs., mostly Books of Mormon, and 
started in company with Elder Harry
Brown, crossed the river into Jackson 
county, and felt thankful. We bowed
our knees, and prayed that God might 
protect us from the mob while going 
through the country, and that his 
judgments might rest upon the wicked
who had shed the blood of the Saints
in that land, that the land might be 
cleansed from sin. I had a petition 
to the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Governor]] of Missouri, for re-
dress of wrongs perpetrated upon us 
in Jackson county, for the purpose of 
obtaining signatures. We bent our 
way south, through Jackson county, 
without any molestation; yet, in one
instance, we were preserved from a 
mob of about sixty, assembled at a 
grog-shop which we had to pass.

(To be continued.)Elder, and a small Branch organized
of twelve members, by Elder Pulsi-
pher.

In February following, in company 
with Elder Holton, I walked some
sixty miles to the town of [[Fabius, Onondaga County, New York|Fabius]], to 
attend an evening meeting of the 
Saints in that place, where Elder Pul-
sipher was presiding. I saw the book 
of commandments or revelations given 
through [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], and I believed 
them with all my heart, and rejoiced 
therein; and after spending several
days, and holding several meetings, 
we returned home rejoicing.

During the winter, we were visited 
by several of the Elders. Feb. 1st.,
Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] called upon us 
and instructed the Branch till mid-
night; we had a precious time. I 
accompanied brother Pratt to Jeffer-
son county, and told him my circum-
stances; he said it was my duty to 
prepare myself to go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and 
join the Camp of Zion. I immedi-
ately settled my business.

April 11, 1834âWith my horses 
and wagon, I took brothers Harry 
Brown and [[Warren Ingles|Warren Ingles]], and started 
for Zion. I met with [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]],
[[John M. Murdock|John Murdoch]] and other Elders, on 
the way, and arrived in Kirtland on 
the 25th day of April, 1834.

The Prophet Joseph invited me to
make his house my home; I accepted 
his offer, and staid with him about 
one week. I became acquainted with 
many of the High Priests, Elders and
Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirt-
land, and heard many of the Elders
speak, and I felt to rejoice before God 
for the light and knowledge which was 
manifested to me during that day.

May 1âI started from Kirtland,
and went to [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]] and re-
mained till all the company joined 
us, when we were organized.

March [May] 7âWe took up our line of 
march, pitched our tents by the way, 
and travelled to [[Missouri|Missouri]].

After we had pitched our tents in 
[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay county]], (our numbers being 205) 
and many of the brethren had taken 
sick, and some had died, Joseph re-
quested the camp to disperse, except 
enough to take care of the sick. All
who had teams were required to leave 
the ground and go among the bre-
thren. I went to brother Lyman
Wight's, in company with Heman 
Hyde and [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. Shortly, 
Joseph called the brethren together at 
Lyman Wight's, and told them if they
would humble themselves before the
Lord, and covenant to keep His com-
mandments and obey His counsel, the 
plague should be stayed from that
hour, and there should not be another 
case of cholera in the Camp. The 
brethren covenanted to do this, and 
the plague was stayed, and there was 
not another case in Camp.

President Joseph Smith returned to
Kirtland with many of the brethren;
I remained with Lyman Wight, labor-
ing with my hands till the following 
winter.

I had a great desire to preach the 
Gospel, which I did not name to my 
brethren; but one Sunday evening I 
retired into the woods alone, and 
called upon the Lord in earnest prayer, 
to open my way to go and preach the 
Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth. 
The Spirit of the Lord bore witness 
that my prayer was heard, and should 
be answered. I arose from my knees
happy, and walked some forty rods, 
and met [[Elias Higbee|Elias Higbee]], a High Priest,
with whom I had staid a number of 
months. As I approached him, he 
said, "Brother Wilford, the Spirit of
the Lord tells me that you should be 
ordained, and go on a mission." I re-
plied, "I am ready."

At a meeting of the High Council at 
Lyman Wight's, Clay county, Mis-
souri, Nov. 5th, I was ordained a 
Priest by Elder [[Simeon Dagget Carter|Simeon Carter]]; Ste-
phen Winchester and Heman T. Hyde 
were also ordained Priests.

Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] said he would like 
to have me go into the Southern States, 
through [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] and Ken-
tucky; and if I could find any body 
who had faith enough to go with meâ
for it would be a dangerous country
to travel in, in consequence of the 
Missouri persecutionsâto take him.
I told him I was as ready to go south 
as anywhere, and asked if I should go
through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson county]], as it lay in
our route. He replied, it would be at 
the risk of life, and he had not faith 
enough to undertake it; if I had, I 
might try it. I also asked him, if I 
went through Jackson county, if I
should start without purse or scrip,

HISTORY 
OF 
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-

At an early age my mind was exer-
cised upon religious subjects, although
I never made a profession until 1830. 
I did not then join any church, for
the reason that I could not find any 
denomination whose doctrines, faith
or practice, agreed with the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, or the ordinances and 
gifts which the Apostles taught. 
Although the ministers of the day 
taught that the faith, gifts, graces, 
miracles and ordinances, which the 
ancient Saints enjoyed, were done
away and no longer needed, I did not 
believe it to be true, only as they 
were done away through the unbelief 
of the children of men. I believed 
the same gifts, graces, miracles and 
power would be manifest in one age of 
the world as in another, when God had 
a Church upon the earth, and that the 
Church of God would be re-established
upon the earth, and that I should live
to see it. These principles were rivet-
ed upon my mind from the perusal 
of the Old and New Testament, with 
fervent prayer that the Lord would
show me what was right and wrong, 
and lead me in the path of salvation,
without any regard to the opinions of
man; and the whisperings of the Spirit
of the Lord for the space of three 
years, taught me that he was about to 
set up his Church and kingdom upon 
the earth in the last days. I was
taught these things from my youth by 
[[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], an aged man, who 
lived in [[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]], Conn., who was
frequently called the old prophet 
Mason. He taught me many things 
which are now coming to pass. He 
did not believe that any man had 
authority to administer in the ordi-
nances of the Gospel, but believed it
was our privilege, through faith, prayer 
and fasting, to heal the sick and cast 
out devils by the laying on of hands, 
which was the case under his admini-
stration, as many could testify.

In 1832, I was inspired to go to 
[[Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]; my brother, [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]],
was also directed by the Spirit of God
to go to the same place. When we
met, we both told our impressions,
and it caused us to marvel and wonder
what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode
Island; but, as we had made prepara-
tions to move to the west, we let out-
ward circumstances control us, and,
Jonah like, instead of going to Rhode
Island, we went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego 
county, New York, and there remained 
until Dec. 29, 1833, when I heard El-
ders [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] and Elijah  
Cheeny preach. My brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]]
and I believed their testimony, enter-
tained the Elders, and offered our-
selves for baptism the first sermon we
heard. We read the Book of Mor-
mon, and I received a testimony that
it was true.

We soon learned what the Lord 
wanted of us in Rhode Island, for at
the time we were warned to go there, 
two of the Elders were preaching there, 
and had we gone, we should have em-
braced the Work at that time.

Dec. 31âI was baptized by Elder 
Zerah Pulsipher; he confirmed me the 
same evening.

Jan. 2, 1834âI was ordained a 
Teacher, and my brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] an
August 1832 a continuance of the foreerding subject
I have hastily noticed in the foregoing pages some of the leading circumstances
of my life, up to the time of my entering the ranks of the Servants of 
God. In looking it over I find many imperfections but as it was written
some time since and in great haste I shall let it remain for the
present and continue my narrative begginning where I
left off

 When I entered the ranks of Gods people and first commenced
the Christians warfare I had but faint ideas of the narrowness
of that Way, and but little realized that it was as strait a
way as the scriptures represent it to be, that but few should
find & walk in it. Much less did I in my weakness conceive
the many artful & cunning devices of Satan to draw the
child of God from the paths of holiness I had not yet learnt
by experience that the Devil like a roaring Lion goeth about
seeking whom he may devour and that he grasps with his
deadly claws every one that turns aside from the Highway
of Holiness. But as I turned and set my face Zion ward and
began to take up my march thither I soon began to hear
the â at first but whispered suggestions of the Adversary trying to
win me back to his service and I soon began to feel his firey
darts levelled and hurled at me from almost every quarter
I soon found that I had enlisted as a Soldier in a warfare
and that I must act not only the offensive but likewise
the defensive part and if I would gain the prize I must
fight. But I had yet (as a raw undiciplined recruit) to learn the
use of the armour with which Christians fight their battles
and from whom I could expect help from trouble

I could not wield with ease the Sword of the Spirit and the
Shield of Faith though a comfortable garment ^& armour^, did not fit
my body Shapen and conceive in Sin, in fine the garments
of Salvation could not be expected to fit perfectly, and set
with ease on one who had so long been clothed with shame
and clad with the filthy garments of Unrighteousness
But I had yet to learn of My Captain, of Him who is meek
and lowly some simple & humble lessons of Christianity
before I could make much resistance with the enemy
in case of an open attack. Encouraging thought that
the Captain of our Salvation being in all points tempted
as we are is able to succour those that are tempted
and that he will with every temptation provide
a way for our escape
have barely been missed a ^the^ passing bullet, and
have passed through a score of other hair-breadth
escapes. It has appeared miraculous to me, that
with all the injuries and broken bones, which
I have met with ^had^; I have not a lame limb about
me, but have been enabled to endure the hardest
labor, exposures and journeys, have often
walked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles in a
day. The protection and mercy of God has been
over me and my life thus far has been preserved
for which blessings I feel to render the gratitude
of my heart to my Heavenly Father; praying
that the remainder of my days may be
spent in his service and in the building up
of his Kingdom.of mortification I showed it to Prest. [[Brigham Young|Young]] who advised
me to cleanse my stomach immediately and put
on onion poultices and any thing that would draw
the poison from my system into my arm, which
I counsel I immediately put into execution. the
29th was another trying day to my life, the poison
had so thoroughly penetrated my whole system that
my strength left me I could not stand, I was led
to my bed, my bowels and stomach ceased to
act, my speech was like that of a drunken man
Prest. Young called into company with [[Dr Sprague|Dr Sprague]]
and laid hands upon me and rebuked the disease
and the power of the distroyer which had sceized
my body and promised me in the name of the
Lord, that I should not die but live to finished
my work which was appointed me, upon the
Earth. I soon began to recover; the poison and
mortification left my body system and centered
in my arm, and was drawn from my arm
through the aid of charcoal poultices, moistened
with a strong decoction of wormwood rag weed
and wild sage; the dead flesh was removed
from my arm with instruments and lunar caustic
and in a few days I was well again.
I have occupied considerable space in refering
to those peculiar circumstances, which have attended
me during life, and to sum the matter up, it stands
thus: I have broken both legs, one twice in two ^in two places^, both
arms, both ankles, ^dislocated^ my breast bone and three ribs, ^and ^had^ both ankles dislocated^
I have been drown^e^d, froze, scalded, and bit by
a mad dog; have been in two water wheels under
full head of water; have passed through several
severe fits of sickness; & encountered poison in its
worst forms; have landed in a pile of rail-road ruinsNauvoo August 1st 1840
had to mount^ed^ my horse and ride ^rode^ 2 1/2 miles, over a
very rough road and had to dismount^ed^ twice
in consequence of miry places, my breast and
vitals were so badly torn to pieces that at each step of
the horse the pain went through me ^like an^ arrow; I continued
on horse back until I arrived at [[Turkey Creek, Douglas County, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turkey Creek]]
on the north side of [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] I then became
exhausted and was taken off my horse and
carried to my wagon in a chair; I was met in
the street by Prests [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]]
& [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] and others who assisted in carrying
me to ^my^ family; before laying me upon my bed, the
Presidency laid hands upon me rebuked my
suffering and distress in the name of the
Lord, and said I should live and not die, I 
was then laid upon my bed in my wagon
and as the Apostles prophesied upon my head
so it came to pass. I did live and not die. I 
employed no physician on this occasion but
was administered to by the Elders of Israel
and nursed by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Wife]]. I lay upon my bed
unable to move, until my breast bone began
to knit together, which commenced on the 9th
day, I began to walk about in 20 days in
30 days from the time I was hurt, I again
commenced to do hard labor.
On the 21st day of April 1856, I innoculated
my arms with poison and mortification ^ensued^; while
assisting to remove an ox that had died from
poison and had been skinned; the poison worked
through my system for seven days before it
showed itself outwardly. on the 28 my arm began 
to swell, was in great pain and showed signsand their lives were saved, by having a long 
train of freight between the passenger cars and the 
engine, which ^all of them^ were mashed to pieces, the engineer 
was killed, some of the passengers had bones broken 
I escaped unhurt. 
On the 5th day of Oct 1846, while with the Camp 
of Israel building up [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|winter quarters]] on the west 
side of the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri river]], (then Indian country,) I 
passed through one of the most painful and serious 
misfortunes I ever of any of my life I took my axe 
and went two and a half miles on to the bluffs, to 
cut some shingle timber to cover my shanty cabin 
I was accompanied by two other men and while 
falling the 3rd trees ^was falling^ which was an oak over 2 ft 
diameter I stepped behind it some 10 feet, and also 
to one side the same distance, where I thought I 
was entirely out of danger, but when the tree fell 
there being a crook in the body of it, ^which^ struck a knoll 
on the ground when the whole body shot endways 
back of the stump and bounded, and the butt of the 
tree struck me on the breast, and knocked me several 
feet into the air, ^against a standing oak^ and the falling tree followed me 
in its bound and caught me against the standing 
tree and I came down between the them, before 
reaching the ground I was liberated from them 
and struck the ground upon my feet, badly bru^i^sed 
my left thigh the whole length of it and my hip 
also ^and^ my left arm, it also broke my breast bone 
also 3 ribs on my left side also bruised my lungs, 
vitals and left side were also bruised in a shocking manner. 
after the accident I sat upon a log until Mr
[[John Garrison|Mo Garrison]] went a quarter of a mile to get my 
horse; notwithstanding I was so badly hurt I had and shut me up fast, ^between the bolster and tongue^ but in such a manner 
that my head and shoulders dragged on the ground 
my horses took fright and ran out into an open 
prairie and thus dragged me in this possession ^position^ 
for about half a mile. I managed to guide them 
with my left hand, so as to run them into a corner ^of a high worm^
of the fence, where we landed in a pile together. I was 
considerably bruised but escaped without any broken bones. 
On the 23rd July 1842 Prest [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] sent 
me to S from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis]] to procure a 
stock of paper. I went down upon a steamboat was 
6 days on the way, during which time I was severely 
attacked with billious fever. The day I made my 
purchase, the fever was so high I was scarcely sensible 
of what I was doing, as soon as I made my 
purchase, and got my freight on board, I took my 
birth and lay there until I arrived at Nauvoo, which
was on the 10 of Aug.st. I was confined to my bed 40 
days and passed through the most severe fit of 
sickness I ever endured, my life was dispaired 
of by many of my friends; I was administered 
to by Prst Smith and the Twelve: my life was 
preserved by the power of God. I took a relapse 
twice after I began to recover, once while in council 
with the Presidency & Twelve, my strengths left me 
my breath stoped and I felt as though I was 
struck with death. 
On the 12th Sept 12, 1843 I left At 5 o'clock p.m. I 
left [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]], on the express train for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]
while passing through Chester woods 6 miles south [of] 
[[Kennebunk, York County, Maine|Kennebunk]] some person having pried up ^raised^ the ^one of the^ rails
and put under them ^rolled^  a log, ^under it^ and it being dark
the we struck it at full speed and landed in
a pile of ruins. 3 cars were filled with passengersDuring the winter of 1831, while in [[New Hartford, Litchfield County, Connecticut|New hartford]], Ct. 
I passed through a severe fit of sickness course of 
lung fever. In 1833, the day I was baptized into the church
of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints; one of my horses, newly 
caught ^sharp shod^, kicked my hat off my head and had he struck 
2 inches lower, would probably have killed me instantly, 
in 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same team 
down a hill on a sleigh without any box the bottom 
boards slipped forward under the roller and caught 
the ground, turned end ways and fell on the horses' 
backs, ^throwing me between^ between the horses, they ran to the bottom of the 
hill dragging me by ^with^ the lines, head foremost with 
the sleigh on top of me about 20 rods over a smooth 
snow path, I escaped unharmed however, in the 
midst of both dangers. In 1834 while traveling in 
Zion's camp in [[Missouri|Mo.]] a rifle was accidentally discharged 
and the ball passed through 3 tents with about 12 men 
in each, and lodged in a wagon axletree while a 
man was standing behind it, it ^and^ injured no one 
^it^ passed within a few inches of my breast, and many 
others escaped as narrowly as myself: a few months 
afterwards a musket heavily loaded with buckshot was accidentlally snapped 
with the muzzle pointed at my breast within a few
few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot, it 
had a good flint and ^was^ well primed, but it missed fire 
and my life was a gain preserved. In April 1839 
in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] Ills. I was riding upon the running 
gears of a wagon without a box, I was sitting upon 
the forward axletree, the bolt came out, fastening 
the copuling pole, which left the hind wheels, and 
my weight on the forward bolster and tongue
turned the copuling pole, clear over onto the 
horses backs, turned the stakes upside downsaved my life, for had I struck upon any other part 
of my body, it must have killed me instantly, as it was 
my bones crushed from under me as though they were 
reeds, it broke my left leg twice in two places and 
put out both my ankles in a shocking manner
and the Horse came near rolling over me in his 
struggles to get up; my uncle, [[Titus Woodruff|Titus Woodruff]], saw 
me fall got assistance me and carried me to his house
I lay from 2 O'clock ^pm^ till 10 at night without medical aid 
then my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] arrived bringing Dr [[Dr. Swift|Swift]] of [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] 
with him who set my bones boxed up my limbs and carried 
me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my fathers;
my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention 
and in 8 weeks I was out doors upon my crutches. 
In 1827 while attempting to clear the ice out of a 
water wheel; standing upon the wheel with one arm 
around the shaft; a man hoisted the gate and 
let a full head of water upon it, as soon as the 
water struck the wheel it ^the wheel^ it started, my feet slipped into the wheel 
I immediately plunged head long foremost over the 
rim of the wheel into about 3 feet of water and my 
weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I should 
have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to 
death. In 1831 while having charge of the flouring 
mill in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsville]] Ct. I was standing inside of a breast 
wheel 20 ft. in diameter, upon one of the arms near the 
top, clearing out the ice, when a full head of water 
was let on to it, it immediately started; but I droped my 
ax and leaped through the wheel to the bottom of it, by 
the shaft and arms about 20 feet: as I struck the bottom 
of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone 
wall with only about 2 feet of water clearance 
between it and the wheel, the wheel caught me and 
rolled me out into the water below where I found myself 
with-out any bones broken, but with some bruses and much fright.  overcome with cold, ^so that^ I could not travel. I crawled 
into the hollow of a large apple tree a man in the 
distance seeing me go into ^it^ the tree hastened to my 
rescue, realizing my danger more fully than I did
when he arrived at the spot I had fallen asleep and 
was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in arousing 
me to a sense of my situation, he procured means 
to carry me to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house, and through 
a kind providence my life was again preserved. 
At 14 years of age, I split my left instep open with an ax 
which went nearly through my foot; and it was 9 months getting 
well. At 15 year of age, I was bitten in my left hand 
by a mad dog in the last stage of hydrophobia; he only 
dented my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood & 
I was again preserved through the mercies of God 
from an awful death. At the age of 17, I met
with an accident which caused me much suffering
and came near ending my life, I was riding a 
very ill tempered horse, which I was not acquainted 
with, and while going down a very steep ^rocky^ hill, the 
horse took the ^taking^ advantage of the ground, suddenly 
leaped from the ground ^road^, and ran down the 
steepest part of it ^the hill^, amid the roughest of the rocks 
at full speed, and commenced kicking up at 
the same time, and attempted to throw me over 
his head upon the rocks, but I lodged upon the top 
of his head grasped hold of each ear, as with 
a death grasp, expecting every moment to be dashed 
to pieces among ^against^ the rocks, while in this position 
sitting astride of his neck with no bridle to guide 
him but his ears, he plunged down the hill under 
full speed until he ran against a rock, which ^and^
dashed him to the ground. I went over both his head on 
and the rock, about one rod, and struck the ground 
square on my feet, being the only thing visible that between the headblock and the fender post, and broke 
both bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken to the 
house and lay nine hours before my bones were 
set, which time was spent amidst ^suffering severe pain, but 
being young my bones soon knitt together and in 
a few days, I was again upon my feet; during 
my confinement, by this lameness, my bro., [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]], 
was my companion in the same room going through with 
a course of the typhus fever. When 7 years of age, I was 
riding on the top of a load of hay, which my uncle,
[[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozen Woodruff]], was driving to the barn, he turned 
the load over upon me. I was nearly strangled for 
the want of air, before the hay was removed. ^Â¶^At 8 
years of age ^old^ I was riding in a one horse wagon with 
several others, the horse took fright ran down a 
steep hill and turned the wagon over upon us; but 
again while in the midst of danger my life was pre-
served; none of us were seriously injured. When 9 years 
^old^ I climbed into an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon 
a dry limb, which broke and I fell about 15 feet upon 
my back which beat the breath out of my body, a cousin 
ran and told my parents I was dead; before they 
arrived at the spot, I came to my senses and met 
my parents ^them^ coming to me. When 12 years of age 
I was drownd in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington Rriver]], and sunk 
in 30 ft of water, and after carrying one person 
to the bottom with me, I was miraculously saved 
by a young man named [[John Bacon|Bacon]] by diving to the 
bottom, and carrying with him a large stone, to holld hold 
him down until he obtained my body, not expecting 
to save my life ^me alive^: I suffered much in being restored to 
life: ^at 13 years of age^ While passing through [[Farmington Meadows, Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington meadows]], in the 
depth of winter, the roads were drifted with snow, and in 
an exceedingly blustering day I became so chilled and History of Wilford Woodruff concluded

WILFORD WOODRUFF.

-[CONTINUED.]-
CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.
-[Written at [[Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Great Salt Lake City]], February, 1858.]-

VARIED and diverse are the lives and for-
tunes of men; while the paths of some are 
strewn with flowers and ease from the cradle 
to the grave, with naught to disturb their
peace; others are marked victims of varied
misfortunes, accidents and dangers. The last
named class is the one in whose ranks I have 
stood, through my infancy, childhood, youth
and manhood, up to the present time, so much 
so that it has seemed as though some invisible
power or fate was watching my foot steps in
order to find some opportunity to take my life
from the earth. I can only attribute the con-
tinuation of my life to the present time to a 
merciful God, whose hand has been stretched
out and rescued me from death in the midst of
the many dangers and hair breadth escapes, I 
have passed through; some of which I will 
here mention.

When three years of age, I fell into a cal-
dron of boiling water, was instantly caught 
out, but was so badly scalded, that it was nine 
months before I was considered out of dan-
ger.

At five years of age, I fell from the great 
beam of a barn, striking my face upon the 
floor, which came near breaking my neck.

Three months afterwards, I broke one of my
arms, by falling down stairs. I soon after
broke my other arm by falling out of a high
stoop, upon a pile of timber.

When six years of age, I came near being
killed by a surly bull. My [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and I were
feeding pumpkins to the cattle; a surly bull 
drove my cow away from the one she was
eating. I took the pumpkin he had left, upon
which he pitched at me. My father told me 
to throw down the pumpkin and run. I ran 
down a steep hill, and took the pumpkin with
me, being determined that the cow should have
her rights. The bull pursued; as he was
about to overtake me, I stepped into a post
hole and fell; the bull leaped over me, after 
the pumpkin, and tore it to pieces with his 
horns, and would have served me in the same 
way, had I not fallen.

During the same year I went into my father's
saw mill, with several others; I got upon the
head-block to take a ride while the carriage 
was running back, not anticipating any dan-
ger; my leg was caught between the head-
block and the fender-post, and broke both 
bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken 
to the house, and lay nine hours before my
bones were set, suffering severe pain; but being
young, my bones soon knit together and I was 
upon my feet again; during my confinement by 
this lameness, my bro. [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]] was also
confined in the same room with the typhus 
fever.

When seven years of age, I was riding on
the top of a load of hay, which my uncle, Oz-
en Woodruff, was driving to the barn; he turn-
ed the load over upon me; I was nearly suffo-
cated for the want of air, before the hay was
removed.

At eight years old, I was riding in a one
horse wagon with several others; the horse
took fright, ran down a steep hill, and turned 
the wagon over upon us; but again while in 
the midst of danger, my life was preserved:
none of us were seriously injured.

When nine years old, I climbed into an elm
tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon a dry
limb, which broke, and I fell about fifteen feet
upon my back, which beat the breath out of 
my body. A cousin ran and told my parents I
was dead; before they arrived at the spot, I
came to my senses, and met them.

When twelve years of age, I was drowned
in [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]], and sunk in 30 ft. of
water, and after carrying one person to the 
bottom with me, I was miraculously saved 
by a young man, named [[John Bacon|Bacon]], diving to the
[Column 2]
bottom, and carrying with him a large stone
to hold him down until he obtained my body,
not expecting to save me alive: I suffered much 
in being restored to life.

At thirteen years of age, while passing 
through [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] meadows, in the depth of 
winter, the roads were drifted with snow; and 
in an exceedingly blustering day, I became so 
chilled and overcome with cold that I could 
not travel. I crawled into the hollow of a 
large apple tree. A man in the distance, see-
ing me go in, hastened to my rescue, realizing 
my danger more fully than I did: when he ar-
rived at the spot, I had fallen asleep, and was 
nearly insensible; he had much difficulty in 
arousing me to a sense of my situation. He 
procured means to carry me to my father's 
house, and through a kind providence, my life 
was again preserved.

At fourteen years of age, I split my left 
instep open with an ax, which went nearly 
through my foot: it was nine months getting 
well.

At fifteen years of age, I was bitten in my 
left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of 
hydrophobia; he dented my hand with his 
teeth, but did not draw blood, and I was again 
preserved, through the mercies of God, from 
an awful death.

At the age of seventeen, I was riding a very 
ill-tempered horse that I was not acquainted 
with; and while going down a very steep 
rocky hill, the horse taking advantage of the 
ground, suddenly leaped from the road, and 
ran down the steep, amid the rocks, at full 
speed, and commenced kicking up, and at-
tempted to throw me over his head upon the 
rocks; but I lodged upon the top of his head, 
grasped hold of each ear as with a death grip, 
expecting every moment to be dashed to pieces 
against the rocks. While in this position, 
sitting astride of his neck, with no bridle to 
guide him but his ears, he plunged down the 
hill under full speed, until he ran against a 
rock and was dashed to the ground. I went 
over both his head and the rock, about one rod, 
and struck the ground square on my feet, being 
the only thing visible that saved my life; for
had I struck upon any other part of my body, 
it must have killed me instantly; as it was, my 
bones crushed from under me, as though they 
were reeds. It broke my left leg in two places, 
and put out both my ankles in a shocking 
manner, and the horse came near rolling over 
me in his struggles to get up. My uncle, 
[[Titus Woodruff|Titus Woodruff]], saw me fall, got assistance
and carried me to his house. I lay from 2 p.m. 
till 10, without medical aid; then my father 
arrived, bringing [[Dr. Swift|Dr. Swift]], of Farmington, with 
him, who set my bones, boxed up my limbs, 
and carried me in his carriage eight miles 
that night, to my father's. My sufferings 
were very great; I had good attention, how-
ever, and in eight weeks I was out doors upon 
my crutches.

In 1827, while attempting to clear the ice 
out of a water-wheel, standing upon the wheel 
with one arm around the shaft, a man hoisted 
the gate, and let a full head of water upon it; 
as soon as the water struck the wheel, it 
started; my feet slipped into the wheel, but I 
immediately plunged head foremost over the 
rim into about three feet of water, and my 
weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I 
should have been drawn under a shaft and 
crushed to death.

In 1831, while having charge of the flouring 
mill in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Collinsville]], Connecticut, I was stand-
ing inside of a breast wheel, 20 feet in dia-
meter, upon one of the arms near the top, 
clearing out the ice, when a full head of water 
was let on to it. The wheel immediately 
started; but I dropped my ax and leaped 
through it to the bottom, by the shaft and 
arms about twenty feet; as I struck the bot-
tom of the wheel, I was rolled out against a 
ragged stone wall with only about two feet 
clearance between it and the wheel; the 
wheel caught me and rolled me out into the 
water below, where I found myself without 
any bones broken, but with some bruises and 
much fright.

[Column 3]
During the winter of 1831, while in New 
Hartford, Ct., I passed through a severe course 
of lung fever.

In 1833, the day I was baptized, one of my 
horses, newly sharp shod, kicked my hat off 
my head, and had he struck two inches lower
would probably have killed me instantly; in
ten minutes afterwards, while driving the 
same team down a hill on a sleigh without 
any box, the bottom boards slipped forward 
under the roller and caught the ground, turned 
endwise, and fell on the horses' backs, throw-
ing me between the horses; they ran to the 
bottom of the hill, dragging me with the lines, 
head foremost, with the sleigh on top of me, 
about twenty rods over a smooth snow path: 
I escaped unharmed, however, in the midst of 
both dangers.

In 1834, while traveling in Zion's Camp in 
[[Missouri|Missouri]], a rifle was accidentally discharged, 
and the ball passed through three tents, with 
about twelve men in each, and lodged in a 
wagon axle-tree, while a man was standing 
behind it, and injured no one; it passed within 
a few inches of my breast, and many others 
escaped as narrowly as myself.

A few months afterwards, a musket, heavily 
loaded with buckshot, was accidentally snap-
ped within a few feet of me, with the muzzle 
pointed at my breast; it had a good flint and 
was well primed, but it missed fire, and my 
life was again preserved.

In April, 1839, in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]], Illinois, I was 
riding upon the running gears of a wagon with-
out a box, sitting upon the forward axletree, 
when the bolt, fastening the coupling pole, 
came out, which left the hind wheels; and my 
weight on the forward bolster and tongue, 
turned the coupling pole over on to the 
horses, turning the stakes upside down, and 
shut me up fast between the bolster and tongue, 
but in such a manner that my head and 
shoulders dragged on the ground; my horses 
took fright, and ran out into an open prairie
and dragged me in this position for about half 
a mile. I managed to guide them with my 
left hand, so as to run them into a corner of a 
high worm fence, where we landed in a pile 
together. I was considerably bruised, but es-
caped without any broken bones.

July 23, 1842âPrest. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], sent me 
from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] to [[St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis]] to procure a stock of 
paper. I went down upon a steamboat; was 
six days on the way, during which time I was 
severely attacked with bilious fever. The day 
I made my purchase the fever was so high I 
was scarcely sensible of what I was doing. 
As soon as I made my purchase and got my 
freight on board, I took my berth and lay there 
until I arrived at Nauvoo on the 10th of Aug. 
I was confined to my bed forty days, and pass-
ed through the most severe fit of sickness I 
ever endured; my life was despaired of by 
many of my friends. I was administered to 
by Prest. Smith and the Twelve: my life was 
preserved by the power of God. I took a re-
lapse twice after I began to recover; once 
while in council with the Presidency and 
Twelve; my strength left me, my breath stop-
ped, and I felt as though I was struck with 
death.

Sept. 12, 1843âAt five o'clock p.m., I left 
[[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] on the express train for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]. 
While passing through [[Chesterwoods, Maine|Chesterwoods]], six 
miles south of [[Kennebunk, York County, Maine|Kennebunk]], after dark, and 
while going at full speed, we struck one of 
the rails which some persons had raised by 
rolling a log under it, and landed in a pile; 
three cars were filled with passengers, and 
their lives were saved by having a long train 
of freight between the passenger cars and the 
engine; all of them were mashed to pieces; the 
engineer was killed, some of the passengers 
had bones broken; I escaped unhurt.

On the 5th of Oct., 1846, while with the 
camp of Israel building up [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]], 
on the west side of the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri river]], (then 
Indian country) I passed through one of the 
most painful and serious misfortunes of my 
life. I took my axe and went two and a half 
miles on to the bluffs to cut some shingle tim-
ber to cover my cabin; I was accompanied by
[Column 4]
two men. While the third tree was falling, 
which was an oak, over two feet in diameter, 
I stepped behind it some ten feet, and also to 
one side the same distance, where I thought I 
would be entirely out of danger; but when the 
tree fell, there being a crook in the body of it, 
which struck a knoll on the ground, the whole 
body shot endwise back of the stump and 
bounded, and the butt of the tree struck me on 
the breast and knocked me several feet into 
the air against a standing oak, and the falling 
tree followed me in its bound and caught me 
against the standing tree, and I came down 
between them; before reaching the earth, how-
ever, I was liberated from them, and struck 
the ground upon my feet in a badly bruised con-
dition. My left thigh, the whole length of it, 
and my hip and left arm were much bruised; 
my breast bone and three ribs on my left side 
were broken; my lungs, vitals and left side 
were also bruised in a shocking manner. After 
the accident I sat upon a log until Mr. 
[[John Garrison|John Garrison]] went a quarter of a mile to get 
my horse. Notwithstanding I was so badly 
hurt, I mounted my horse, and rode two and a 
half miles over a very rough road, dismount-
ing twice in consequence of miry places; my 
breast and vitals were so badly torn to pieces, 
that at each step of the horse the pain went 
through me like an arrow. I continued on 
horseback until I arrived at [[Turkey Creek, Douglas County, unorganized U.S. Territory|Turkey creek]], on 
the north side of Winter Quarters. I then be-
came exhausted, and was taken off my horse 
and carried to my wagon in a chair. I was 
met in the street by Prests. [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], 
[[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] and others, 
who assisted in carrying me to my family. 
Before laying me upon my bed, the Presidency 
laid hands upon me, rebuked my suffering and 
distress in the name of the Lord, and said I 
should live and not die. I was then laid upon 
my bed in my wagon, and as the Apostles pro-
phesied upon my head, so it came to pass. I 
employed no physician on this occasion, but 
was administered to by the Elders of Israel 
and nursed by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]]. I lay upon my bed 
unable to move until my breast bone began to 
knit together, which commenced on the ninth 
day. I began to walk about in twenty days; 
in thirty days from the time I was hurt I again 
commenced to do hard labor.

July 5, 1848âWhile on a mission to the 
Eastern States, I drove my carriage, contain-
ing myself and family into the door yard of 
br. [[James Williams|James Williams]] in [[Iowa|Iowa]], to camp for the 
night. I tied my mules to a large oak tree 
several rods from the carriage. As we were 
about to lay down in the carriage for the night, 
I was strongly impressed to go and move my 
mules from the oak tree, and also to move my 
carriage. I followed the dictates of the Spirit, 
and removed my mules to a small hickory 
grove, also moved my carriage several rods, 
and retired to rest. 

In a short time a heavy rain storm came on, 
which broke the tree near the ground, and 
laid it prostrate where my carriage had stood. 
As it was, the top struck the hind end of the 
carriage; the tree was two feet in diameter. 
Thus, by obeying the whisperings of the Spirit, 
myself and family were preserved.

On the 21st day of April, 1856, while assist-
ing to remove an ox that had died from poison 
and had been skinned, I inoculated my arm 
with poison, and mortification ensued. The 
poison worked through my system for seven 
days before it showed itself outwardly. On 
the 28th my arm began to swell, was in great 
pain and showed signs of mortification. I 
showed it to Prest. Young, who advised me to 
cleanse my stomach immediately, and put on 
onion poultices, and anything that would draw 
the poison from my system into my arm, which 
counsel I immediately put in execution. The 
29th was another trying day to my life; the 
poison had so thoroughly penetrated my whole 
system, that my strength left me; I could not 
stand, I was led to my bed, my bowels and 
stomach ceased to act, my speech was like 
that of a drunken man. Prest. Young called, 
in company with [[Samuel Lindsey Sprague|Dr. Sprague]], and laid hands 
upon me, and rebuked the disease and the

HISTORY
OF 
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)
-[CONTINUED.]-

March 8, 1839âI attended a conference at 
[[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], Illinois.

â13âI took my family and started for 
[[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], where I arrived on the 16th. I dined 
with [[Emma Hale Smith Bidamon|Emma Smith]] at Judge [[John Cleveland|Cleveland's]]. I
then went on to the bank of the river near 
Quincy, and saw a great many of the Saints, 
old and young, lying in the mud and water, in 
a rain storm, without tent or covering, which
suffering was caused by the unhallowed perse-
cution of the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]]. The sight
filled my eyes with tears, while my heart was
made glad at the cheerfulness of the Saints in
the midst of their affliction.

â17 (Sunday) âI had an interview with 
President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]]. 
We held a meeting with the Saints; $50 and a 
number of teams were raised to bring out the
remainder of the poor from Missouri. Prest.
Young counseled the Twelve to locate their
families for the time being in Quincy. I re-
turned to [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] for my effects. While at 
Springfield I collected $70 for the relief of the 
Saints in Quincy, which I sent to them. I re-
turned to Quincy on the 8th of April, where I 
left my family, and went to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] with the 
Twelve and attended the conference on the 
Temple block on the 26th, where I was or-
dained one of the Twelve Apostles, on the 
corner stone of the Temple, under the hands
of the Twelve, Elder Brigham Young being
mouth. Elder [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] was also ordained 
at the same time. We returned to Quincy on 
the 2nd day of May.

On the 3rd, in company with five of the
Twelve, I went to Judge [[John Cleveland|Cleveland's]], and had 
a happy interview with Prest. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], 
who had just escaped out of the hands of his
persecutors in Missouri; it was the first time
I had seen him for more than two years, and it 
was a happy meeting. I attended the confer-
ence and meetings with the Saints in Quincy
until the 15th, when I moved my family to 
[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]], and occupied a room in the barracks 
with Prest. Young and family. I spent my
time in attending the meetings, councils and
conferences. I wrote in my journal the teach-
[Column 2]
ings, sayings and prophecies of Joseph from 
time to time, as I had opportunity.

July 22âI was with Prest. Joseph Smith
and his council and the Twelve: it was a day 
of God's power with the Prophet. He healed 
many who were sick nigh unto death, among
whom were [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]] and Joseph B. 
Nobles; even the wicked rabble followed to
see the sick healed. As Joseph was about to 
cross the river a man came to him and asked 
him if he would go about three miles and heal
two of his small children, who were twins,
about three months old, and were sick nigh
unto death. He was a man of the world; he
had never heard a sermon preached by a Latter-
day Saint. Joseph said he could not go, but 
he would send a man. After hesitating a mo-
ment, he turned to me and said, "You go with 
this man and heal his children"âat the same 
time giving me a red silk handkerchief, and 
said, "After you lay hands upon them, wipe
their faces with it, and they shall be healed;
and as long as you will keep that handkerchief
it shall ever remain as a league between you 
and me." I went and did as I was command-
ed, and the children were healed.

On the 25th, I was attacked with chills and
fever. I had a chill every other day and was 
very sick.

Aug. 8âI laid my hands upon my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and
children, blessed them, committed them into 
the hands of God, and started upon my Eng-
lish mission, leaving my family sick, and with 
not more than four days' provisions. Br. Brig-
ham Young rowed me across the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]] 
in a boat; I was sick and feeble. When I 
landed I laid down upon the bank of the river 
on a side of sole leather. The Prophet Joseph
came along and looked at me and said, "You 
are starting on your mission." I said yes, but 
I look like a poor instrument for a missionary;
I look more fit for a hospital or dissecting room
than a mission. He replied, "What do you 
say that for? Go ahead in the name of the
Lord, and you shall be healed and blessed on 
your mission." I thanked him. A brother 
came along with a wagon and carried me a 
few miles on my road. I started without purse 
or scrip, and passed by [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]], who
was hewing logs for a house; he was bare-
footed, bare-headed, without coat or vest on. 
He said, "I have no money, but I have an 
empty purse; I will give you that." I went a 
few rods and found Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] build-
ing a log cabin; he said, "I have one dollar; I 
will give you that to put in your purse." He 
blessed me and I went my way, accompanied
by Elder John Taylor. I had a shake of the 
ague every other day and lay on the bottom of 
the wagon while I traveled.

We staid with [[Samuel Harrison Smith|Samuel H.]] and Don Carlos 
Smith at [[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]], and held a meeting with
the Saints, who contributed $9 to our neces-
sities, and [[George Miller|George Miller]] gave us a horse. 
Father [[Zebedee Coltrin|Coltrin]] was going east; he took us into 
his wagon to help up us along. We spent five
days in Springfield, where Elder Taylor print-
ed fifteen hundred copies of a pamphlet upon
the Missouri persecution. We sold our horse, 
and left on the 21st and continued our journey. 
We spent the night of the 24th with Dr. Modi-
sett, of [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terrehaute]].

On the 28th, while traveling, Elder Taylor
fell to the ground as though he had been
knocked down. We administered to him, and 
he revived. On the following day he fell again, 
and fainted several times; it seemed as though
the destroyer would take his life; we traveled 
with him four days after he was taken sick. 
His sickness proved to be bilious fever. We
stopped with him two days, at a German 
tavern, in [[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]], Wayne county, In-
diana, with a kind family, with whom he was 
acquainted. Father Coltrin would stay no 
longer; I proposed to remain with br. Taylor, 
but as I was sick with fever and ague, and not
able to take care of myself, br. Taylor advised 
me to continue my journey with Father Coltrin, 
saying, "it is easier to take care of one sick 
man than two." I committed him into the 
hands of God; and the family promised to do
[Column 3]
all in their power to make him comfortable. 
I parted from him with a heavy heart.

Sept. 2âI continued my journey with Father 
Coltrin to [[Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cleveland]], Ohio. I there took 
steamer on the 10th for [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]]; had a severe
gale, and did not reach Buffalo until the 12th. 
I traveled to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]] on a canal boat; had the
ague daily, was very sick; had no companion
except sectarian priests, who were daily lying 
about the Mormons. I took stage at Albany
for [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Connecticut, on the night of 
the 19th, and rode all night and the following
day; suffered severely with fever and ague. I
arrived at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house in Farmington on 
the 21st, quite sick. I found my father and 
family well.

On the 27th Sept., 1839, my maternal grand-
mother, [[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|Anna Thompson]], died, aged 84; I was 
too sick to attend her funeral. It is a singular 
incident that my grandfather, [[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot Thompson]],
and Anna Thompson, his wife, Samuel Thomp-
son and [[Mercy Thompson|Mercy Thompson]], all of one family, 
died in their 84th year.

On the 4th October, [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adner Hart]], brother to
my step-mother, died, aged 43. He requested
me to preach his funeral sermon. I had been
sick at my father's house with the ague for
fifteen days, attended with a severe cough, 
and the hour appointed for the funeral was the
time for my ague, yet I attended the funeral
and preached, and I had no more ague for 
many days. I left on the 7th, and visited 
New York, [[Long Island, Queens County, New York|Long Island]], and [[New Jersey|New Jersey]], in 
very poor health.

Nov. 1âI assisted Elders [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clark]], [[Alexander Wright|Wright]]
and [[Samuel Mulliner|Mulliner]] to set sail for [[England|England]]. Elder
John Taylor had recovered from his sickness,
and arrived in New York on the 13th Decem-
ber.

Dec. 19âIn company with Elders John 
Taylor and [[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley]], I went on board 
the packet ship Oxford, and sailed for Liver-
pool, where I landed January 11, 1840, in good
health and spirits. When I left my father, he
gave me some money to assist in paying my
passage; also gave me five dollars which he re-
quested me to keep until I arrived in Liverpool, 
saying, I would there need it. This I found to
be true after landing; that money was all we 
had to pay our expenses to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], and we
had twopence left.

We arrived in Preston on the 13th. Had a
happy interview with br. [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]; 
held a council, and agreed that Elder Taylor 
go to Liverpool, Turley to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]], and I 
to [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]].

Jan. 18âI arrived in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]; met Elder
[[William Clayton|Wm. Clayton]], who presided over that branch, 
numbering 164 members. I was immediately 
called upon to visit a woman possessed with 
the devil; she was raging and foaming and had
to be held by four men. The more we rebuked
the devil the worse she raged. We continued
to pray and administer until we cast the devil
out. She arose and gave thanks to the Lord. 
The devil then entered into a young child, and
we cast him out. I preached several times, 
and laid hands on twenty-eight persons. I 
went to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] on the 21st and met with
Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]], president of the Burslem 
branch, which numbered 66. I commenced 
preaching in the Staffordshire Potteries. El-
der Turley left for Birmingham on the 29th.
I remained in the Potteries some forty days, 
preaching, baptizing and confirming, and bless-
ing children.

March 1âAs I met in the evening with a
large assembly in [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], the Lord revealed 
unto me that it would be the last meeting that
I would hold with the Saints in the Potteries 
for many days; I told the people it was the 
last meeting I should hold with them for a 
season; it created much excitement. I had 
appointments out for a week, which I got bro.
Cordon to fill. I went before the Lord in pray-
er, and asked him where I should go; the
Spirit said, "Go to the south." According to 
the directions of the Spirit, on the 3rd, I went 
to [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], and called upon John Ben-
bow at [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castlefroom]]; I found a people prepared
for the gospel. I preached twice at his house. 
On the 6th, I baptized six persons, including
[Column 4]
John Benbow and [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]]. I here found a society 
called "United Brethren," numbering about 
six hundred members, and about fifty preach-
ers; [[Thomas Kington|Thos. Kington]] was the presiding elder. 
They came from all quarters to hear me preach,
and believed my testimony; and I preached 
and baptized daily. The ministers of the
Church of England sent three church clerks to
see what I was doing, and I baptized them. 
One constable came to arrest me for preaching, 
and I baptized him. In about thirty days I
baptized 160, forty eight of whom were preach-
ers of the United Brethren, including their 
presiding elder, Thomas Kington.

I established forty two preaching places,
licensed according to law.

On the 9th April, I had an apointment at 
[[Hawcross, Redmarley D'Abitot, Worcestershire, England|Haw Cross]]. As I was going into the meeting, 
letters were put into my hands from Elder
Brigham Young and others, informing me of 
his arrival with five of the Twelve, and re-
questing me to come to Preston, and attend a
general conference. A vast assembly had
gathered to attend my meeting; the house, yard,
and street were crowded; a mob had also 
gathered. I preached to the people; five came
forward to be baptized. The mob surrounded 
the pool, armed with stones. I dismissed the 
meeting, and went away; but the congrega-
tion and mob remained on the ground till mid-
night; and as there was no prospect of their 
dispersing, and the candidates were anxious to
be baptized, I went down into the water and 
baptized five in the midst of a shower of
stones. The water was all in a foam for a 
rod around me. None that I baptized were 
hit, and I was only hit twice, once on my hip 
and once on my head; the blow on my head 
raised a large bump, which went away while 
I was confirming: subsequently I baptized
many of the mob.

I left next morning for Preston, and attended
the conference with the Twelve, and returned
to Herefordshire, accompanied by Elder Brig-
ham Young, on the 22nd April, and was soon
joined by Elder Willard Richards. Elder 
Young remained twenty seven days, preaching, 
baptizing, confirming and counseling. Num-
bers were added daily to the church: he then
returned to Manchester.

I spent about seven months in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], 
[[Gloucestershire, England|Gloucestershire]] and [[Worcestershire, England|Worcestershire]]. We
baptized over eighteen hundred, including all
of the United Brethren save one. We bap-
tized over two hundred preachers of various 
denominations in that part of the vineyard. 
A synod of church ministers became so alarm-
ed for their flocks in that part of the vineyard, 
they petitioned Parliament to adopt measures
to stop our preaching. They received for an
answer, that if they were as well acquainted
with the Bible as their hunting grounds, and 
were as much interested in the welfare of the 
souls of men, as the chasing of the stags and 
foxes, they would not lose so many of their 
congregations.

Aug. 18âI visited [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] in company with 
Elders H. C. Kimball and G. A. Smith. I 
labored with them in establishing a church,
spending over five months in that populous city.

We visited nearly every part of the city, and 
all the notable places that we could have
access to.

I attended all the general conferences in 
England, and set sail with my brethren of the
Twelve on the ship Rochester, April 20, 1841;
arrived in New York May 20.

I went to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], Maine, after my
wife, and also my son, [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]], who was born
March 22, 1840. My daughter, [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]],
had died July 17, 1840.

I returned to New York, and started for 
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], via the Lakes; was wrecked on Lake
Michigan in the steamer Chesapeake, but ar-
rived in Nauvoo in safety Oct. 6, 1841, when I
had the happy privilege of meeting with the
Prophets Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], and my brethren
of the Twelve.

I bought a log house of brother [[Moses Tracy|Tracy]], on
lot No. 1, block 106, on Hotchkiss and Durfee
Streets. Prest. Joseph Smith afterwards gave
me the lot.

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)
-[CONTINUED.]-

MAY 31âI left my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and friends in Kirt-
land, and walked to [[Fairport Harbor, Lake County, Ohio|Fairport]] with bro. [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]]; 
we were joined by [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]], and took 
the steamer Sandusky and arrived in [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]]
June 1st, and [[Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York|Syracuse]] on the 4th; walked 36
miles to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego Co., N. Y., and 
called upon my two brothers, [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] and 
[[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]], whom I had not seen for several 
years. We visited the churches as far as 
[[Sackets Harbor, Jefferson County, New York|Sackett's Harbor]], called upon Archibald Pat-
ten, and delivered to him some letters from 
[[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]], in which were enclosed many 
one hundred dollar bills, which he had taken 
from the [[Kirtland Safety Society Bank, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland Bank]].

We crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]], visited Upper 
Canada, and attended a conference, May [June] 10th, 
with Elders [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and [[James Blakesley|James Blakesly]], 
in the township of [[Bastard, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Bastard]], Leeds Co. There 
were eight branches represented, containing 
300 members, 13 elders, 5 priests, 8 teachers 
and 6 deacons. Elder [[William Draper|Wm. Draper]] and my-
self ordained 7 elders, 9 priests, 11 teachers
and 5 deacons: five were baptized by Elder 
Page at the close of the conference.

A woman was possessed of the devil and 
greatly afflicted, much of the time was dumb; 
four of us laid hands upon her, and cast the 
devil out in the name of Jesus Christ, and she 
was made whole, and gave thanks unto God, 
and went on her way rejoicing.

We visited several other branches and
preached the word of God, and several of the 
sick were healed.

We returned to [[Kingston, Frontenac County, Canada West, British North America|Kingston]], took steamer for 
[[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]], and canal for [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]]; bros. John 
Goodson, [[Isaac Russell|Isaac Russell]] and [[John Snider|John Snider]] ac-
companied us from Canada, and left us at 
[[Schenectady, Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]], to join Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]], [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] 
and [[Willard Richards|Richards]] at New York, to go to [[England|England]].

We walked from Albany to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], 
Conn.; attended a conference of the Saints in
[[Canaan, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Canaan]]; arrived at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house July 
6th. This was the first time I had seen my 
father or relatives in Conn., since I joined the 
church; they received me kindly. On the 10th, 
I preached in the City Hall in [[Collinsville, Hartford County, Connecticut|Colinsville]], and 
a mob gathered and attempted to break up the
meeting, with fife and drum, hollowing and 
yelling; they were urged on by a Presbyterian 
priest. At the close of the meeting the priest
came to me with his rabble, and asked many
questions; he said I had no right to my opinion, 
and no man had a right to preach the gospel 
unless he had a collegiate education. I told 
him I would admit that point when he would 
tell me at what college Jesus Christ and his 
apostles obtained their education: the priest 
and rabble then left.

â12âI preached in a schoolhouse in West 
Avon to an attentive congregation; after meet-
ing I baptized my uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]], his 
[[Acksah Merrill Woodruff|wife]] and son, [[John Woodruff|John]], in fulfillment of a dream 
which I had at ten years of age.

I visited most of my relatives in Conn., and
preached the gospel to them.

â16âI preached at [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart's]] in [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]],
where I was met by my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-mother]] and sis-
ter, also by my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]], who had travelled alone 
from Kirtland, and was on her way to visit
her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father]] in [[Maine|Maine]].

â19âElder Hale went to [[New Rowley, Essex County, Massachusetts|New Rowley]],
Mass., to visit his friends. I had been soli-
cited to preach to the citizens of Farmington
by many prominent men, but every room which
was offered me, including the town hall, was 
closed against me by the Rev. [[Noah Porter|Noah Porter]], 
pastor of the Presbyterian church, until the
Methodist church was offered me, which he
had not influence to close. Two hours after I 
gave out the appointment, the house was filled,
and I preached to a very attentive congrega-
tion, including my father and his household, 
for an hour and a half, upon the first princi-
ples of the gospel; I gave liberty to the assem-
bly to ask any questions, or find any fault with 
what I had said, but I met with no opposition.

[Column 2]
â20âI left my father's house, and, with 
my wife, rode by stage to [[Hartford, Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford]].

â21âNot having money to pay the fare 
for us both, I paid her fare in the stage to New 
Rowley, Mass., and I walked through a hot
sultry day fifteen hours, averaging three and
a half miles per hour, making 52 miles.

â22âI walked 48 miles.

â23âI walked 36 miles, and arrived at 
Elder [[Nathaniel Holmes|Nathaniel Holmes']], in New Rowley, at 
2 o'clock, p.m., making 136 miles in a little 
over two days and a half. I met with my 
wife and Elder Milton Holmes, at his father's 
house: I spent several days in preaching to the 
Saints in that region.

Aug. 1âWe left New Rowley, and was 
joined by Elder Hale, who accompanied us to 
[[Saco, York County, Maine|Saco]], Maine.

â7âI accompanied my wife to her father's,
in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], Maine. We were kindly re-
ceived: it was the first time I had seen any of 
her relations. We found mother [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Carter]] very 
sick. I spent several days visiting the Saints
in that region.

â10âI accompanied [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra]] and Fabien 
Carter, my brothers-in-law, on a fishing excur-
sion; we caught with hooks 250 cod fish, had-
dock, and hake, and saw four whales; it being
the first time I had ever seen that class of fish 
that swallowed Jonah.

â18âWith Elder Hale, I started to fill my 
mission on [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]]; we walked to Port-
land, and spent the night at Mr. Samuel 
Hale's.

â19âWe took the steamer Bangor 85
miles to [[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owl's Head]], where we arrived at sun-
set, without means to prosecute our journey 
further. We retired to a high hill, and bowed
before the Lord, and prayed that he would 
open our way; the Spirit of the Lord rested 
upon us, and testified unto us that our prayers 
would be answered. As we arose from our 
knees, a sloop came into the harbor; we went 
to the captain, and enquired where he was 
going; he replied, through the channel of 
[[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinal Haven]]; he took us on board and landed 
us on [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Fox Islands]], at 2 a.m. on the 
20th. We wandered in the dark about an 
hour, rambling over rocks and bushes, found the
house of Mr. [[Nathaniel Dyer|Nathaniel Dyer]], and were enter-
tained. It being Sunday morning, Mr. Benj.
Kent piloted us to the Baptist meeting-house,
occupied by Elder [[Gideon J. Newton|Gideon J. Newton]], pastor 
of the only religious denomination upon the
island. At the door, I sent for the deacon,
and told him I wished him to inform the min-
ister that we were servants of God, and wish-
ed to deliver a message to that people. The
minister sent word for us to come into the pul-
pit; accordingly, with valize in hand, we walk-
ed up into the pulpit, and took a seat on each 
side of him. When he closed his discourse, 
he asked me what hour we would like to 
speak; I told him at five; he gave out our ap-
pointment, and invited us to his house. I 
asked him how many school houses were on 
the island; he said four, and gave me their
names. I asked him if they were free for any
one to preach in; he answered in the affirma-
tive. I took out my Bible, Book of Mormon, 
and Doctrine and Covenants, and laid them all 
upon his stand; he promised to read them.
The hour of meeting arrived, and I preached
to a full house upon the first principles of the 
gospel, and bore testimony that the Lord had 
raised up a prophet, and had commenced to 
establish his church and kingdom again upon
the earth, in fulfillment of his word, as spoken 
through the ancient prophets and apostles. 
This was the first discourse ever delivered by 
any Latter-day Saint upon this chain of is-
lands; Elder Hale bore testimony. I gave out 
appointments for preaching in the four school
houses. The people came out en masse to in-
vestigate the principles which we taught. In 
fourteen days we preached nineteen discourses. 
Capt. [[Justus Ames|Justice Ames]] and [[Betsey Hudson Ames|wife]] were baptized 
by Elder Hale. Elder Newton, the Baptist
minister, with his family, attended twelve of 
our meetings, read the books, and was con-
vinced by the Spirit of the Lord that our doc-
trine was true, and he had a hard struggle in
[Column 3]
his mind to know which to do, receive it or re-
ject it; he finally resolved to reject it, and 
commenced preaching against us. He sent for 
Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglass]], Methodist minister, on the 
South Island, to come and help him; he had
been long at variance with Mr. Douglass, but 
they became very friendly and united in a war 
against us. We continued preaching daily
until we baptized most of the members of Mr. 
Newton's church, and those who owned the
meeting house.

I followed Mr. Douglas to his own island, 
and commenced preaching to his church, and
baptized a good share of his members, among 
whom were several sea captains. Ministers 
from the main land were sent for, who came
over and tried to put a stop to the work by
preaching and lying about us; but the work 
continued to roll on. They wished me to work
a miracle to convince them that my doctrine
was true. I told them they had rejected the 
truth, and they would see signs, but not unto 
salvation.

Vinal Haven, which includes both north and 
[[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|south Fox Island]], is in lat. 44Â°, long. 69Â° 10'. 
The inhabitants are generally healthy and in-
dustrious, and hospitable to strangers. The peo-
ple obtain most of their wealth by fishing, and
fit out annually over one hundred licensed ves-
sels, beside many smaller crafts. The north 
island is nine miles long and two wide; popu-
lation 800, and contains a post office, a store, a
grist mill, four school houses, and a Baptist 
church. The land is rocky and rough, yet
there are farms which produce good wheat,
barley, oats, potatoes and grass; the principal 
timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and birch. The 
rasp and gooseberry grow in great abundance. 
Sheep are the principal stock.

South Fox island is about ten miles long and 
five wide, and is a mass of rocks, principally 
granite, formed into shelves, hills, hollows,
and cut up into nooks, points and ravines by
coves and harbors; population, 1000. There
are some small patches under cultivation, at 
the expense of great labor and toil. Many 
resident fishermen fish at [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and 
bring them home, and dry them upon flakes; 
they annually supply the market with a great 
amount of cod fish, mackerel and boxed her-
ring. The latter island contains two stores, 
three tide saw mills, six school houses, a small
branch of the Methodist church and a priest.
The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and
birch, also gooseberries, raspberries, whortle-
berries and upland cranberries; bushes and 
timber grow out of the crevices of the rocks.

There is a great amount and variety of fish
in the waters around these islands, viz.: whale, 
black fish, shark, ground shark, pilot fish,
horse mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, halibut,
cod, pollock, tom cod, hake, haddock, macker-
el, shad, bass, alewives, herring, pohagen,
dolphin, whiting, frost fish, flounders, smelt, 
skate, shrimp, shad, cusk, bluebacks, scollop, 
dogfish, muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five fin-
gers, monkfish, nursefish, sunfish, swordfish,
thrasher, cat, scuppog, twotog, eyefish, cunner,
ling eels, lobsters, clams, mussels, winkles, 
porpoises, seals, &c. &c.

Sept. 6âThe harbor was filled with a 
school of mackerel, which were caught in 
great numbers by the people standing upon the 
wharf.

While standing upon the farm of Eleazar 
Carver on the north island I counted fifty five 
islands, many of which were inhabited.

Oct. 2âI left the island with Elder Hale;
Capt. Ames took us to [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomastown]] in a sloop.

â3âWe walked forty six miles to [[Bath, Sagadahoc County, Maine|Bath]].

â4âWe attended a Baptist convention, 
and preached to a large congregation in the 
evening in [[Pierce's Hall, Bath, Sagadahoc County, Maine|Pierce's hall]]; the people listened 
attentively.

â5âWe walked thirty six miles to Port-
land.

â6âWalked ten miles to father Carter's 
in Scarborough, where I found my wife and
friends well.

â9âI parted with Elder Hale, who re-
turned to Kirtland. I continued preaching 
through various towns on the main land until
[Column 4]
Nov. 2, when I again returned to Fox Islands,
accompanied by my wife.

â15âI visited the [[Isle of Holt, Knox County, Maine|Isle of Holt]], twelve 
miles east, and preached to an attentive con-
gregation, leaving them the Book of Mormon, 
which they promised to read. I returned on
the 16th.

I continued my labors during the winter of 
1837-8, and nearly every person had attended 
my meetings, and taken sides for or against. 
Our enemies made attempts to break up our 
meetings.

Jan. 15, 1838âA company of sailors be-
longing to the United States revenue cutter, 
brought on shore a swivel and joined the mob,
parading near the house where I was preach-
ing, and discharged it several times, accom-
panied with small arms, with the intention of 
breaking up the meeting. Some of the mob 
gathered around to see what effect this would
have. I warned them in the name of the Lord, 
and proclaimed the judgments of God that
awaited the wicked, and shook my garments
in the presence of the people, and told them I 
was clear of their blood; but they only heard
my voice intermingled with the roar of cannon
and musketry. Before I closed speaking, the 
sailors went back on board the revenue cutter.
At the close of the meeting I baptized two, 
also one next day, and while baptizing, the
mob again commenced firing guns. The Bap-
tists and Methodists got up the mob. Mr. 
Douglas, the Methodist priest, when argument
failed him, applied to all the magistrates for 
warrants against me; they refused to grant 
them as he had no cause of complaint.

Feb. 13âI crossed in the mail boat to
[[Hampden, Penobscot County, Maine|Hampden]] and ordained [[James Townsend|James Townsend]]; we 
walked together through deep snows, and 
visited and preached in the towns of Sears-
mont, [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], [[Northport, Waldo County, Maine|Northport]], [[Frankfort, Waldo County, Maine|Frankfort]], Hamp-
den, and twice in the city hall in [[Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine|Bangor]], to
large assemblies, and returned to Fox Islands 
via [[Castine, Hancock County, Maine|Casteem]] and the Isle of Holt. Arrived in 
Vinal Haven March 8. Elder Townsend re-
turned home.

March 22âI accompanied br. [[Cyrus Starrett|Stirrat]], at 
low tide, on to a bar some forty rods from 
shore, to dig some clams. We were soon join-
ed by Mrs. Woodruff and sister [[Sarah Stone|Stone]], who 
had a curiosity to see how clams were dug. 
The ground for about twelve rods nearer shore 
was several feet lower than the point we were 
on, but we were so busily engaged we did not
observe the flowing tide until we were sur-
rounded by water, and having no boat, our only 
alternative was to wade ashore and carry the 
women, which we safely accomplished amid 
the reflection that tide nor time waited for no 
man.

April 4âMr. [[John Kent|Kent]], the postmaster, showed 
me a letter containing two sheets of foolscap
signed by Warren Parrish and several of the
Twelve, who had apostatized and been cut off 
from the church. The communication was 
full of slander and falsehoods against Joseph 
Smith and all that stood by him. It was sent 
with the intention of breaking up the work
upon these islands.

â11âI was visited by Elders Townsend 
and Milton Holmes, who attended conferences
with me upon both islands, and bore their tes-
timony to the people, but the spirit of oppo-
sition increased to a great height. I was 
warned by the Spirit of the Lord to leave for a
season and take a western mission. After
visiting the Saints from house to house, and 
praying with and encouraging them, I left on
the 28th and went to the main land with Elders 
Townsend and Holmes. Mrs. Woodruff re-
turned to her father's. We walked to Scar-
borough. I left May 7th, and walked to Brad-
ford, where I left Elder Holmes, and proceed-
ed to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]].

May 11âI gave out an appointment to preach 
at sister [[Ruth Daggett Vose Sayers|Vose's]] room, and I went to Cambridge-
port to visit Elder [[Albert Perry Rockwood|A. P. Rockwood]], who had 
been imprisoned in jail on pretence of debt,
but in reality out of religious persecution. 
The jailor locked me in until ten p.m.; but 
while it disappointed a congregation of people,
it gave me a happy visit with Elder Rockwood,

HISTORY
OF
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)
-[CONTINUED.]-

March 2âWe cut down a large cotton wood 
tree, and in two days dug out a canoe four feet 
wide and twelve long, put on a pair of oars
and then rowed down the [[Arkansas River, United States|Arkansas river]], 125
miles to [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little Rock]], begging our food by the
way, a meal at a time, as we had opportunity. 
After visiting Little Rock we traveled down 
the river ten miles, and tied up our canoe on 
the east bank and stopped with Mr. Jones. I 
preached next day at his house. On the 16th 
we left our canoe with Mr. Jones and walked
back up the river ten miles, opposite Little 
Rock, and took the old military road, and 
started to wade the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]] swamp, which 
was mostly covered with water from Little 
Rock, Arkansas, to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee, a 
distance of about 175 miles. We waded through 
mud and water knee deep, day after day, and
in some instances forty miles per day, before 
we could get a stopping place.

On the 24th, while in the swamps, I had an 
attack of the rheumatism and could not travel 
fast. My companion, br. [[Henry Brown|Brown]], had got in a 
hurry, and wished to return to his family in 
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and as I could not travel as fast as 
he wished, we parted. He left me sitting on a 
log in the mud and water; I was lame and un-
able to walk, without food, and twelve miles 
from the nearest house on the road; he went 
out of sight in great haste. I then knelt down 
in the water and prayed to the Lord to heal 
me. The Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, 
and I was healed; the pain left me; I arose and 
went my way. Whenever I met with one or 
more families, I preached and bore testimony
to them.

I crossed the Mississippi river in the even-
ing of the 27th of March, and staid at a pub-
lic house kept by Mr. [[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]]. I was 
suspected of being an impostor. Mr. Jackson 
believed I was one of Murrill's clan, who were 
then murdering and stealing negroes, and to 
test me, he gathered together a large house 
full of the most wicked and corrupt people in 
the city, and set me to preaching, to see 
whether I could preach or not.

I do not think that Mr. Jackson or the same 
company of men and women will ever meet
together again for the same purpose, for they 
would not like again to have their sins and 
abominations revealed to each other as point-
edly as I told them that night, through the in-
spiration of the Holy Ghost; they were glad 
to get rid of me upon almost any terms.

I traveled from Memphis to Middle Tennes-
see.

April 4âI met with Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] 
in [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton county]]. He and [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]] 
had labored together through the winter in 
Tennessee, and baptized twenty persons. El-
der Patten had returned to Kirtland. I joined
Elder Parrish and we labored together over 
three months, traveling and preaching daily,
baptizing such as would receive our testimony,
extending our labors in Tennessee and Ken-
tucky.

June 23âWe received a letter from Oliver
Cowdery, requesting Elder Parrish to come to 
Kirtland, and for me to remain and take 
charge of the southern churches, and the Lord 
would bless me in so doing.

June 28âWarren Parrish ordained me an 
Elder. We baptized some forty persons while 
laboring together.

July 23âElder Parrish left. I traveled 
alone through the year, and extended my labors 
both in Kentucky and Tennessee. I baptized
forty-three persons during this season, thirty-
one after br. Parrish left.

Nov. 15âWhile traveling in the night with 
br. [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin L. Clapp]] and others, a tremend-
ous storm of wind and rain overtook us. We
came to a creek which had swollen to such an
extent by the rain that we could not cross 
without swimming our horses; several of the 
company were females. We undertook to head
[Column 2]
the stream, to ford it, but in the attempt, in 
the midst of the darkness and the raging of 
the wind and rain, we were lost in the thick 
woods, amidst the rain, wind, creeks and fal-
len tree tops; we crossed streams nearly twen-
ty times. I was reminded of Paul's perils by 
water; but the Lord was merciful unto us in 
the midst of our troubles, for while we were 
groping in the dark, running the risk of killing 
both ourselves and animals by riding off pre-
cipitous bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone 
round about us, and revealed our perilous situ-
ation as were upon the edge of a deep gulf. 
The light continued with us until we found a 
house and learned the right road; then the 
light disappeared, and we were enabled to 
reach the house of br. [[Henry Thomas|Henry Thomas]] at nine 
o'clock, all safe, having rode twenty miles,
five hours in the storm, and we felt to thank 
the Lord for our preservation.

During the winter and spring I continued to 
labor mostly alone, through Kentucky and 
Tennessee, opening new places, preaching 
daily, baptizing, confirming and organizing 
new branches.

Feb. 26, 1836âAt a conference held at br.
B. L. Clapp's, in [[Calloway County, Kentucky|Callaway county]], Kentucky, 
I ordained [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] and Benjamin Boyd-
ston Elders, and B. L. Clapp and [[Daniel Thomas|Daniel Thomas]]
Priests.

Brs. Smoot and Clapp both entered into the 
labors of the ministry. Elder Smoot frequent-
ly accompanied me on my mission. Elder D.
W. Patten returned to Tennessee in April, and 
joined us in our labors, accompanied by his 
[[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|wife]]. It was a happy meeting. He related 
to me the blessings he had received in Kirtland 
during the endowments. We traveled and la-
bored together; persecution raged against us. 
Elder Patten bore a strong and forcible testi-
mony of the work of God, and when we were 
opposed by mobs he would rebuke them in
great plainness; we were threatened, but not 
injured. The sick were healed under our ad-
ministrations.

May 27âElder Warren Parrish arrived 
from Kirtland. We held a conference on the 
28th, at br. [[Seth Utley|Seth Utley's]]. Seven branches were 
represented containing 116 members. Abel
Wilson and [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpin]] were ordained Priests
and [[Albert Petty|Albert Petty]] a Teacher.

â31âI was ordained by David W. Patten
a member of the second quorum of Seventies.

We labored over a circuit of several hundred 
miles; br. Smoot labored with us, and br. Clapp 
frequently. We traveled two by two, and all 
met together to hold conferences.

June 19âA States warrant was issued
against D. W. Patten, Warren Parrish and 
Wilford Woodruff, sworn out by Matthew 
Williams, a Methodist priest, and served by 
the sheriff, [[Robert Cowan Petty|Robert C Petty]]. Elders Patten 
and Parrish were taken by an armed mob of 
about fifty, under pretence of law, led by the
sheriff, a colonel, first and second major, with 
other officers, and a Methodist priest with a 
gun upon his shoulder. I was in another coun-
ty and therefore not taken. We were accused 
of prophesying falsely, by saying that four 
persons who were baptized should receive the 
Holy Ghost in twenty-four hours, and that 
Christ should come the second time before this 
generation passed away. The whole concern 
was a mob mock trial, contrary to law, justice, 
judgment or truth.

On the 29th, I went to a Baptist meeting
house, on [[Thompson Creek, Weakley County, Tennessee|Thompson's creek]], to preach; the
house was crowded. As I rose to speak, a 
Baptist priest, Mr. Browning, arrived at the 
door on horseback, and stepped in greatly agi-
tated, and told the deacon to forbid my preach-
ing in the house; at the same time commenced 
a tirade of abuse against the Mormons, telling
several lies, which I corrected before the peo-
ple, which increased his rage. As I was for-
bidden to preach in the house, and had been 
invited, and traveled many miles to fulfil my
appointment, I told the people I would like to 
preach and was willing to stand on a wood
pile, a fence, a cart, or any place they would
appoint. A man rose and said he owned the 
land in front of the meeting house, and I might
[Column 3]
stand and preach on that, and welcome. All 
the congregation, with the exception of the 
minister and one deacon, arose and left the 
house, walked across the street and formed 
seats of a worm fence, and gave good attention 
while I preached for an hour and a half on the
principles of the gospel.

When I closed, Mr. [[Randolph Alexander|Randolph Alexander]], 
who had never heard a Mormon Elder speak 
before, said, the people of the present day 
made him think of a pen of hogs; the keeper
would make a trough, and pour into it hot or
cold water, dish water or anything else, and
they would drink it; but let a stranger come 
along and pour over a basket of corn on the 
back side of the pen, and the hogs would be
frightened and run and snort all over the pen. 
He said it was so with the people; the priests
would feed them with any kind of doctrine,
no matter how false, the people will swallow 
it down, but let a stranger come and preach
the gospel of Jesus Christ, which will save
the people, as Mr. Woodruff has done, and the
people are afraid of him.

Mr. Alexander invited me home, bought a 
Book of Mormon, and was soon baptized, and 
several others followed his example.

July 14âI wrote a letter to Oliver Cowdery, 
and sent him a list of subscribers for the Mes-
senger and Advocate, and a detail of my mission
in the South.

â18âI rode in company with A. O. Smoot
to a ferry on the [[Tennessee River, United States|Tennessee River]]. The fer-
ryman was absent. We were offered the use 
of the boat, and ferried ourselves; but not 
being much used to the business, and losing 
one oar in the river, and having to row with a 
broken oar, we landed a great distance below
the usual place with a high circulation of 
blood and blistered hands; but our horses leapt
the bank, and we went on our way to the 
[[Sandy River, Tennessee|Sandy]], which we swam, and spent the night at 
[[Thomas Frazier|Thomas Frazer's]].

â30âWe preached at Mr. [[David Crider|David Crider's]], 
also on Sunday, the 31st, where we were
threatened by a mob. I baptized Mr. Crider 
amid the scoffs of the rabble, who went in the 
night and poisoned both of our horses; the one 
which I rode, belonging to bro. [[Samuel Walker West|Samuel West]],
died in two days afterwards; brother Smoot's 
recovered; the swine that eat of the horse 
flesh also died.

Aug. 11âI met with D. W. Patten and 
wife; he and bro. Parrish had been driven out
of Benton into [[Henry County, Tennessee|Henry Co.]], and Elder Parrish
had left for Kirtland.

â29âWe were visited by Elders T. B. 
Marsh and [[Elisha Hurd Groves|E. H. Groves]], from [[Caldwell County, Missouri|Caldwell Co.]], 
Mo.

Sept. 2âWe held a conference at Damon's 
Creek, Callaway Co., Kentucky; several 
branches were represented, containing 119 
members; [[Johnston F. Lane|Johnson F. Lane]], Benj. L. Clapp
and Randolph Alexander were ordained elders,
and [[Lindsey Anderson Brady|Lindsey Bradey]] a priest by D. W. Patten, 
who baptized five at the close of the confer-
ence.

I was released from my labors in the South,
and counselled to go to Kirtland and receive
my endowments, as was also A. O. Smoot.

Sept. 19âElders Marsh and D. W. Patten 
and wife, and E. H. Groves, started for Far 
West. I organized the first company of Saints,
who emigrated from the Southern States, which 
numbered twenty-two souls. I appointed El-
der Boydston president of the company, and 
counselled them to be united, and to remember
their prayers night and day before the Lord.

â20âThe camp started. I spent a few 
days visiting the branches; baptized and con-
firmed eight, and obtained thirty subscribers 
for the Messenger and Advocate.

Oct. 20âIn company with A. O. Smoot and 
Jesse Turpin, I started for Kirtland; this was 
the first time I had ever traveled on a steam-
boat. We left the steamer at [[Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky|Louisville]] on 
the 28th, and spent nineteen days visiting El-
der Smoot's relations and preaching among the 
people; we visited the [[Big Bone Lick, Boone County, Kentucky|Big Bone Lick]]. We ar-
rived in [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]] Nov. 17, where we saw 
thirteen persons dead and wounded taken from 
the steamer Flora, which had burst her pipes
[Column 4]
while running a race; arrived in Kirtland on
the 25th, and had the happy privilege of meet-
ing the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], and many elders, with 
whom I was acquainted in the camp of Zion.
29th, I heard Joseph preach in the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Temple]]. 
In the afternoon I was called to speak and 
read the 56th chap. of Isaiah, and made some
remarks, and gave an account of my mission 
in the South; Elder Smoot also addressed the 
Saints.

I was counselled by the Presidency to at-
tend the school in the Temple, taught by Prof.
[[H. M. Hawes|Haws]]. I studied the Latin language and Eng-
lish Grammar, and boarded with bro. Ira 
Bond.

I attended meetings with the Seventies and 
other quorums during the winter of 1836-7, and 
received much valuable instruction.

Dec. 20, 1836âI was present at the organ-
ization of the third quorum of Seventies; there
were twenty-seven ordained.

Jan. 3, 1837âI was set apart to be a mem-
ber of the first quorum of Seventies.

â25âAt early candle light, a cloud began 
to arise in the north east and reached to the
north west, having the appearance of fire, and
it soon spread over the whole horizon. The 
reflection of the clouds upon the earth, which
was covered with snow, had a blood red ap-
pearance. It commenced at about 6 o'clock,
and lasted till past 10 p.m.

â29âPrests. Joseph Smith and O. Cow-
dery addressed the Saints in the Temple. Jo-
seph blessed the people in the name of the
Lord, and said, if we would be faithful, we
should arise above our embarrassments and be 
delivered from the hands of our enemies.

â30âI wrote an article on faith, which
was published in the Messenger and Advocate.

Feb. 19âI attended meeting at the Temple. 
Prest. Joseph Smith had been absent on busi-
ness for the church, but not half as long as
Moses was in the mount away from Israel; 
yet many of the people in Kirtland, if they 
did not make a calf to worship as did the
Israelites, turned their hearts away from the 
Lord and from his servant Joseph, and had 
engaged in speculation and given away to 
false spirits, until they were darkened in their 
minds; and many were opposed to Joseph 
Smith, and some wished to appoint David 
Whitmer to lead the church in his stead. In
the midst of this cloud of dark spirits, Joseph 
returned to Kirtland, and this morning arose
in the stand. He appeared much depressed; 
but soon the Spirit of God rested upon him, 
and he addressed the assembly in great plain-
ness for about three hours, and put his enemies
to silence. When he arose he said, "I am still 
the President, Prophet, Seer, Revelator and 
Leader of the church of Jesus Christ. God, 
and not man, has appointed and placed me 
in this position, and no man or set of men
have power to remove me or appoint another
in my stead, and those who undertake this, if 
they do not speedily repent, will burn their
fingers and go to hell.["] He reproved the people 
sharply for their sins, darkness and unbelief; 
the power of God rested upon him, and bore
testimony that his sayings were true.

March 23rd, was spent in the Temple by the 
Saints in Kirtland in fasting and prayer. Pat-
riarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith, sen.]], presided. The
Spirit of the Lord was poured out upon the
people; a contribution was taken up for the
poor.

April 4âI received my washings and an-
ointings in the house of the Lord. I spent the
whole night in the Temple, with others of the 
Seventies, in prayer and fasting, the Spirit of
the Lord rested upon us. After twenty-four 
hours I partook of food.

â6âThe Presidency of the Church, the 
Twelve Apostles, and other quorums, met in 
solemn assembly, and sealed upon our heads,
our washings, anointings and blessings with a 
loud shout of hosannah to God and the Lamb;
the Spirit of the Lord rested upon us. After 
spending three hours in the upper room, the 
quorums repaired to the lower court; the vails 
were lowered, and the ordinance of washing 
of feet was administered. Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kim-]]

HISTORY 
OF 
WILFORD WOODRUFF.
(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)

IN tracing the history of my fathers, I find 
it difficult to obtain a satisfactory account of
the Woodruff family for more than three gen-
erations.

My great grandfather, [[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1706|Josiah Woodruff]],
lived nearly one hundred years, and possessed 
an iron constitution and performed a great
amount of manual labor nearly up to the time
of his death. His wife's name was [[Sarah Woodford Woodruff|Sarah]]; she 
bore to him nine children as follows:â[[Josiah Woodruff, b. 1743|Josiah]], 
[[Appleton Woodruff|Appleton]], [[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1747|Eldad]], [[Elisha Woodruff|Elisha]], [[Joseph Woodruff, b. 1752|Joseph]], [[Rhoda Rosetta Woodruff Gridley|Rhoda]],
[[Phoebe Woodruff, b. 1738|Phebe]], and two [[Sarah Ann Woodruff|names]] not given.

My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was the 
third son of Josiah. He was born in Farming-
ton, Hartford Co., Connecticut, in 1751; he 
also possessed a strong constitution; it was 
said that he performed the most labor for 
several years of any man in Hartford Co., and
from over exertion in hewing timber he was 
attacked with rheumatism in his right hip, 
which caused severe lameness for several 
years before his death. He married Dinah 
Woodford, by whom he had seven children,
viz.:â[[Eldad Woodruff, b. 1773|Eldad]], [[Elizabeth Woodruff Frisbie|Elizabeth]], [[Samuel Gridley Woodruff|Samuel]], [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek]], [[Titus Woodruff|Titus]],
[[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Hellen]], and [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]].

Eldad married [[Lewey Woodford Woodruff|Lewey Woodford]]; Elizabeth, 
[[Amasa Frisbie|Amasa Frisby]]; Samuel, Miss [[Nancy Case Woodruff|Case]]; Aphek,
[[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Beulah Thompson]] and [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Azubah Hart]]; Titus,
[[Louisa Alling Woodruff|Louisa Allen]]; Hellen, [[Amos Wheeler|Amos Wheeler]]; and 
Ozem, [[Acksah Merrill Woodruff|Acksah Merrill]] and [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah Hart]]; all 
of whom had large families.

My grandfather died in Farmington, with
the spotted fever in 1806, aged 55 years. My 
grandmother, Dinah, died in 1824, in the same 
place, with a cancer in the left breast: her 
sufferings were very great.

My father, Aphek Woodruff, was born in 
Farmington, Nov. 11, 1778; he married Beulah 
Thompson, who was born in 1782, Nov. 29, 1801. 
She bore three sons, namely:â[[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], born 
Nov. 29, 1802; [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Ozen Thompson]], born Dec. 22
1804; myself born March 1, 1807.

My mother died with the spotted fever, June 
11, 1808, aged 26 years, leaving me fifteen 
months old. My father's second wife, Azu-
bah Hart, was born July 31, 1792; they were
married Nov. 9, 1810; they had six children,
viz.: [[Philo Woodruff|Philo]], born Nov. 29, 1811, and died by
poison administered by a physician Nov. 25, 
1827; [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel Hart]], born April 11, 1814, and 
died in [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terrahaute]], Oct. 18, 1838; [[Franklin Woodruff|Franklin]], 
born March 12, 1816, and died June 1; [[Newton Woodruff, b. 1818|Newton]], 
born June 19, 1818, drowned Sept., 1820; Ju-
lius, born April 22, 1820, and died in infancy; 
[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]], born June 19, 1821. I married her to 
[[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]] in Farmington, Conn., Aug.
4, 1841[.]

My father was a strong constitutioned man, 
and has done a great amount of labor. At 
eighteen years of age, he commenced attending
a flouring and saw mill, and continued about
[Column 2]
50 years; most of this time he labored eight-
een hours a day.

He never made any profession of religion,
until I baptized him with all his household
into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints on the first day of July, 1838. He was
a man of great charity, honesty, integrity and
truth, and made himself poor by giving to the 
poor, and accommodating his fellow men by 
loaning money and becoming surety for his 
neighbors, and always saying yes, to every 
man who asked a favor at his hand.

I was born in the north part of the town of 
Farmington, now called [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], Hartford Co., 
Conn., March 1, 1807. I assisted my father 
in attending the Farmington Mills, until I was 
twenty years of age.

In April, 1827, I took the flouring mill of my 
aunt, Hellen Wheeler, which I attended three
years. In May, 1830, I took charge of the 
flouring mill of Mr. [[Samuel Collins|Collins]], the ax manufac-
turer, in [[South Canton, Hartford County, Connecticut|South Canton]], Conn. At the end of 
one year it was demolished to make way for 
other machinery. In March, 1831, I took 
charge of the flouring mill owned by Mr. Rich-
ard B. Cowles of New Hartford, Conn. In 
the spring of 1832, in company with my oldest 
brother, Azmon, I went to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego
Co., New York, and purchased a farm and 
saw mill, and settled in business.

At an early age my mind was exercised upon
religious subjects, although I never made a 
profession until 1830. I did not then join any
church, for the reason that I could not find any 
denomination whose doctrines, faith or prac-
tice, agreed with the gospel of Jesus Christ,
or the ordinances and gifts which the apostles 
taught. Although the ministers of the day 
taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles 
and ordinances, which the ancient saints en-
joyed, were done away and no longer needed,
I did not believe it to be true, only as they
were done away through the unbelief of the 
children of men. I believed the same gifts, 
graces, miracles and power would be manifest
in one age of the world as in another, when 
God had a church upon the earth, and that 
the church of God would be re-established 
upon the earth, and that I should live to 
see it. These principles were rivetted 
upon my mind from the perusal of the Old 
and New Testament, with fervent prayer
that the Lord would show me what was right 
and wrong, and lead me in the path of salva-
tion, without any regard to the opinions of 
man, and the whisperings of the Spirit of the 
Lord for the space of three years, taught me 
that he was about to set up his church and 
kingdom upon the earth in the last days. I 
was taught these things from my youth by 
[[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], an aged man, who lived in
[[Simsbury, Hartford County, Connecticut|Simsbury]], Conn., who was frequently called
the old prophet Mason: he taught me many 
things which are now coming to pass. He did 
not believe that any man had authority to ad-
minister in the ordinances of the gospel, but 
believed it was our privilege through faith,
prayer and fasting, to heal the sick, and cast 
out devils by the laying on of hands, which 
was the case under his administration, as 
many could testify.

In 1832, I was inspired to go to Rhode Is-
land; my brother, Asahel, was also directed
by the Spirit of God to go to the same place. 
When we met, we both told our impressions,
and it caused us to marvel and wonder, what 
the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island; but as 
we had made preparations to move to the 
west, we let outward circumstances control us, 
and Jonah-like, instead of going to Rhode Is-
land, we went to Richland, Oswego Co., New 
York, and there remained until Dec. 29, 1833, 
when I heard Elders [[Zerah Pulsipher|Zerah Pulsipher]] and 
[[Elijah Cheney|Elijah Cheeny]] preach. My brother Azmon 
and I believed their testimony, entertained the 
elders and offered ourselves for baptism the
first sermon we heard. We read the Book of 
Mormon, and I received a testimony that it 
was true.

We soon learned what the Lord wanted of
us in Rhode Island, for at the time we were 
warned to go there, two of the elders were
[Column 3]
preaching there, and had we gone, we should 
have embraced the work at that time.

Dec. 31âI was baptized by Elder Zerah 
Pulsipher; he confirmed me the same evening.

Jan. 2, 1834âI was ordained a teacher, and 
my brother Azmon, an elder, and a small 
branch organized of 12 members by Elder Pul-
sipher.

In February following, in company with
Elder Holton, I walked some 60 miles to the 
town of [[Fabius, Onondaga County, New York|Fabius]], to attend an evening meeting 
of the Saints in that place, where Elder Pulsi-
pher was presiding; I saw the book of com-
mandments or revelations given through Joseph
Smith, Jr., and I believed them with all my heart
and rejoiced therein; and after spending sev-
eral days, and holding several meetings, we
returned home rejoicing.

During the winter, we were visited by sev-
eral of the elders. Feb. 1st, Elder Parley P.
Pratt called upon us and instructed the branch
till midnight: we had a precious time. I ac-
companied brother Pratt to [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson Co.]], and 
told him my circumstances; he said it was my 
duty to prepare myself to go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and 
join the camp of Zion. I immediately settled 
my business.

April 11, 1834âWith my horses and wagon
I took brs. [[Henry Brown|Harry Brown]] and [[Warren Ingles|Warren Ingles]], 
and started for Zion. I met with [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]],
[[John M. Murdock|John Murdoch]] and other Elders on the way, 
and arrived in Kirtland on the 25th day of 
April, 1834.

The Prophet Joseph invited me to make his 
house my home; I accepted his offer, and staid
with him about one week. I became acquaint-
ed with many of the High Priests, Elders and 
Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland and 
heard many of the Elders speak, and I felt to 
rejoice before God for the light and knowledge 
which was manifested to me during that day.

May 1âI started from Kirtland, and went 
to [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]], and remained till all the com-
pany joined us, when we were organized.

March [May] 7âWe took up our line of march, 
pitching our tents by the way, and traveled to 
[[Missouri|Missouri]].

After we had pitched our tents in Clay coun-
ty (our numbers being 205) and many of the 
brethren had taken sick, and some had died, 
Joseph requested the camp to disperse, except 
enough to take care of the sick; all who had 
teams were required to leave the ground and 
go among the brethren. I went to br. Ly-
man Wight's, in company with [[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]] 
and [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. Shortly, Joseph called 
the brethren together at Lyman Wight's, and 
told them if they would humble themselves be-
fore the Lord, and covenant to keep His com-
mandments and obey His counsel, the plague
should be stayed from that hour, and there
should not be another case of cholera in the 
camp. The brethren covenanted to do do this
and the plague was stayed and there was not 
another case in camp.

Prest. Joseph Smith returned to Kirtland
with many of the brethren, I remained with 
Lyman Wight, laboring with my hands till the 
following winter.

I had a great desire to preach the gospel, 
which I did not name to my brethren, but one
Sunday evening I retired into the woods alone, 
and called upon the Lord in earnest prayer to 
open my way to go and preach the gospel to 
the inhabitants of the earth; the spirit of the 
Lord bore witness that my prayer was heard, 
and should be answered. I arose from my 
knees happy, and walked some forty rods and 
met [[Elias Higbee|Elias Higbee]], a High Priest, with whom 
I had staid a number of months. As I ap-
proached him, he said "Br. Wilford, the Spirit 
of the Lord tells me that you should be or-
dained and go on a mission." I replied, "I 
am ready."

At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman 
Wight's, Clay county, Missouri, Nov. 5, I was
ordained a Priest by Elder [[Simeon Dagget Carter|Simeon Carter]]; 
[[Stephen Winchester|Stephen Winchester]] and Heman T. Hyde were
also ordained Priests.

Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] said he would like to have
me go into the Southern States, through Ar-
kansas, [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[Kentucky|Kentucky]], and if I
[Column 4]
could find any body who had faith enough to 
go with me, for it would be a dangerous coun-
try to travel in, in consequence of the Missou-
ri persecution, to take him. I told him I was 
as ready to go South as any where; and asked 
if I should go through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson county]], as it 
lay in our route. He replied, it would be at 
the risk of life, and he had not faith enough 
to undertake it; if I had, I might try it. I also 
asked him, if I went through Jackson county, 
if I should start without purse or scrip accord-
ing to the law of God. He answered, that he 
had not got faith enough to start on a mission
through Jackson county without money, and 
if I did it, I must do it on my own faith. I 
felt strenuous to keep the commandments, so 
I started without money. I called upon Elder 
Harry Brown, and asked him to accompany
me; he consented, and Bishop Partridge ap-
pointed him to go with me.

Jan. 13, 1835âI received an honorable dis-
charge from Lyman Wight, certifying that I
had faithfully performed my duties in Zion's 
camp.

I took my valise in hand, weighing 15lbs, 
mostly books of Mormon, and started in com-
pany with Elder Harry Brown, crossed the 
river into Jackson county, and felt thankful. 
We bowed our knees, and prayed that God
might protect us from the mob while going 
through the country, and that His judgments 
might rest upon the wicked who had shed the
blood of the Saints in that land, that the land 
might be cleansed from sin. I had a petition 
to the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Governor]] of Missouri, for redress of
wrongs perpetrated upon us in Jackson county, 
for the purpose of obtaining signatures. We 
bent our way south, through Jackson county, 
without any molestation; yet, in one instance, 
we were preserved from a mob of about sixty,
assembled at a grog shop which we had to 
pass.

June [January] 18âWe called at the Harmony mis-
sion and had an interview with the President, 
a Presbyterian minister. Although it was 
near sundown he would neither give us any-
thing to eat, nor lodge us, because we were
Mormons. It was fifteen miles to the nearest 
house, which was Jerrew's Indian trading 
house. We asked the minister to direct us 
there. He gave us directions, but the Spirit 
said to me he was deceiving us. I asked him 
three times, and he declared he was telling us 
the truth. We followed his directions and we
came to the [[Osage River, Missouri|Osage river]] swamp, where we 
were lost in darkness of the night. We 
followed the river, but as it is very crooked, 
we made but little progress. After traveling 
through mud and water for one hour, we con-
cluded to go out on the open prairie and lie 
down in the grass until morning, but when we 
got out into the prairie we heard the Osage In-
dians' drum and shout at the trading house
as they were having a pow-wow. As we ap-
proached, we were met by a dozen large savage
looking dogs; they smelt us in a friendly man-
ner, but did not attempt to bite nor bark. We 
arrived about midnight, covered with mud, 
hungry and weary, and were kindly received 
and entertained for the remainder of the night 
by [[Michael Geraud|Mr. Jerrew]], who had an Osage squaw for 
a wife; she prepared us a good supper, but 
marvelled that we did not drink coffee. She 
proffered us their best bed, which was highly
ornamented, but we declined her kind offer, as 
we were wet and muddy; she made us a good 
bed of mackinaw blankets before a large fire, 
and we slept comfortably. May the Lord re-
ward both Mr. Jerrew and wife, and the Pres-
byterian minister according to their deserts.

â19âMr. Jerrew gave us a good breakfast, 
put us across the Osage river in a canoe, and 
we started upon our long day's walk, it being 
sixty miles to the nearest house; we had not 
anything with us to eat. Most of our travels 
through the day was through prairie; before 
dark we entered timbered land; as we ap-
proached the timber a large black bear met 
us; we had no weapons. When the bear got 
within about six rods of us, he rose upon hi[s] [page folded]
hind feet and examined us a short time, an[d] [paged folded]
went off. We were soon enveloped in su[ch] [page folded]

[[Heman Tilton Hyde|Heman Hyde]]. We spent the summer together, laboring
hard, cutting wheat, quarrying rock, making brick, or anything
else we could find to do.
In the fall I had a desire to go and preach the gospel. I
knew the gospel which the Lord had revealed to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]
was true, and of such great value that I wanted to tell it to
the people who had not heard it. It was so good and plain,
it seemed to me I could make the people believe it.
I was but a Teacher, and it is not a Teacher's office to go
abroad and preach. I dared not tell any of the authorities of
the Church that I wanted to preach, lest they might think I
was seeking for an office.
I went into the woods where no one could see me, and I
prayed to the Lord to open my way so that I could go and
preach the gospel. While I was praying, the Spirit of the
Lord came upon me, and told me my prayer was heard and
that my request should be granted.
I felt very happy, and got up and walked out of the woods
into the traveled road, and there I met a High Priest who
had lived in the same house with me some six months.
He had not said a word to me about preaching the gospel;
but now, as soon as I met him, he said, "the Lord has revealed
to me that it is your privilege to be ordained, and to go and
preach the gospel.â
I told him I was willing to do whatever the Lord required
of me. I did not tell him I had just asked the Lord to let
me go and preach.
In a few days a council was called at [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight's]], and I
was ordained a Priest and sent on a mission into [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] and
[[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in company with an Elder. This mission was given
us by Elder [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]], who was the first Bishop
ordained in the Church.
The law of God to us in those days was to go without purse
or scrip. Our journey lay through [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], from
which the Saints had just been driven, and it was dangerous
for a "Mormon" to be found in that part of the [[Missouri|State]].
We put some Books of Mormon and some clothing into our
valises, strapped them on our backs, and started on foot. We
Crossed the ferry into Jackson County, and went through it.REWARD OF SELFISHNESS.
business and went to work, cleaning out the room, and imme-
diately spread down our blankets, so as to hold a right to the
room. It was but a short time afterwards that our brethren,
who were attacked by cholera, were brought in and laid upon
our beds. None of us ever used those blankets again, for they
were buried with the dead. So we gained nothing but expe-
rience by being selfish, and we lost our bedding.
I will exhort all my young friends to not cherish selfishness;
but if you have any, get rid of it as soon as possible. Be
generous and noble-hearted, kind to your parents, brothers,
sisters and play-mates. Never contend with them; but try to
make peace whenever you can. Whenever you are blessed
with any good thing, be willing to share it with others. By
Cultivating these principles while you are young, you will lay
a foundation to do much good through your lives, and you
will be beloved and respected of the Lord and all good men.

AFTER [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], the Prophet, had led Zion's Camp to Mis-
souri, and we had passed through all the trials of that
journey, and had buried a number of our brethren, as recorded
in history, the Prophet called the Camp together, and organ
ized the Church in Zion, and gave much good counsel to all.
He advised all the young men, who had no families, to stay
in Missouri and not return to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. Not having any family,
I stopped with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], as did [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]] and LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
ing day we continued our journey. We pitched our tents at
night and had prayers night and morning. The [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] told
us every day what we should do.
We were nearly all young men, gathered from all parts of
the country, and strangers to each other; but we got acquainted
very soon, and had a happy time together.
It was a great school for us to be led by a Prophet of God
thousand miles, through cities, towns, villages, and through
the wilderness.
When persons stood by to count us they could not tell how
many we numbered; some said five hundred, others one
thousand.
Many were astonished as we passed through their towns.
One lady ran to her door, pushed her spectacles to the top of
her head, raised her hands, and exclaimed; "What under
heavens has broken loose?" She stood in that position the
last I saw of her.
The published history of Zion's Camp gives an account of
the bones of a man which we dug out of a mound. His name
was Zelph. The Lord showed the Prophet the history of the
man in a vision. The arrow, by which he was killed, was
found among his bones. One of his thigh bones was broken
by a stone slung in battle. The bone was put into my wagon,
and I carried it to [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], Missouri, and buried it in the
earth.
The Lord delivered Israel in the days of Moses by divid-
ing the Red Sea, so they went over dry shod. When their
enemies tried to do the same, the water closed upon them and
they were drowned. The Lord delivered Zion's Camp from
their enemies on the 19th of June, 1834, by piling up the
waters in [[Fishing River, Clay County, Missouri|Fishing River]] forty feet in one night, so our ene-
mies could not cross. He also sent a great hail-storm which
broke them up and sent them seeking for shelter.
The camp of Zion arrived at Brother [[John Matthias Burk|Burk's]], in Clay County,
Missouri, on the 24th of June, 1834, and we pitched our tents
on the premises. He told some of the brethren of my com-
pany that he had a spare room that some of us might occupy
if we would clean it. Our company accepted the offer, and,
fearing some other company would get it first, left all otherCAMP OF ZION STARTS.
It was the 26th of April, 1834, that I was first introduced
to Elders [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]]. When I met
Brother Brigham, he had his hands full of butcher knives;
he gave me one, and told me to go and put a good handle on
it, which I did. I also had a good sword, which Brother
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] wanted, and I gave it to him. He carried it all the
way in Zion's camp to [[Missouri|Missouri]], and when he returned home
he gave it back to me.
When I was called to go on a mission to the South I left the
sword and knife with [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]]. When he was taken
prisoner at [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], with Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], he had both
the sword and knife with him. All their weapons were taken
from them, so were the arms of many of the Saints at Far
West, under promise that they should be returned to them
when they were prepared to leave the State. When the
brethren went to get their arms, Father [[James Allred|James Allred]] saw my
sword, which Lyman Wight had laid down, and took it and
left his own, and afterwards gave it to me and I still have it.
I prize it because the Prophet Joseph carried it in Zionâs
Camp. The knife I never obtained.
The first day of May, 1834, was appointed for the Camp of
Zion to start from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] to go up to Missouri for the
redemption of their brethren. Only a small portion of the
Camp was ready. The Prophet told those who were ready, to
go to [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]] and wait for the remainder. I left, in com-
pany with about twenty men, with the baggage wagons. At
night we pitched our tents. I went to the top of the hill and
looked down upon the camp of Israel. I knelt upon the ground
and prayed. I rejoiced and praised the Lord that I had lived to
see some of the tents of Israel pitched, and a company gathered
by the commandment of God to go up and help redeem Zion.
We tarried at New Portage until the 6th, when we were
joined by the Prophet and eighty-five more men. The day
before they arrived, while passing through the village of Mid-
dlebury, the people tried to count them; but the Lord multi-
plied them in the eyes of the people, so that those who
numbered them said there were four hundred of them.
On the 7th, Brother Joseph organized the camp, which con-
sisted of about one hundred and thirty men. On the follow-LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
In the spring of 1834, I went to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], saw the Prophet
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], and went with him, and with more than two
hundred others in Zion's Camp, up the [[Missouri|Missouri]]. When I
arrived at my journey's end, I took the first opportunity and
wrote a long letter to Father [[Robert Mason|Mason]], and told him I had found
the church of Christ that he had told me about. I told him
about its organization and the coming forth of the Book of
Mormon; that the Church had Prophets, Apostles, and all
the gifts and blessings in it, and that the true fruit of the
kingdom and church of Christ were manifest among the
Saints as the Lord had shown him in the vision. He received
my letter and read it over many times, and handled it as he
had handled the fruit in the vision; but he was very aged,
and soon died. He did not live to see any Elder to administer
the ordinances of the gospel unto him.
The first opportunity I had, after the doctrine of baptism
for the dead was revealed, I went forth and was baptized
for him. He was a good man and a true prophet, for his proph-
ecies have been fulfilled.
CHAPTER II.
PREPARING TO GO UP TO ZIONâFIRST MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT [[Brigham Young|YOUNG]]âCAMP OF ZION STARTSâNUMBERS
MAGNIFIED IN THE EYES OF BEHOLDERSâREMARKABLE
DELIVERANCEâSELFISHNESS, AND ITS REWARD.
I ARRIVED at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] on the 25th of April, 1834, and
for the first time saw the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]. He
invited me to his house. I spent about a week with him, and
became acquainted with him and his family, also with many
of the Elders and Saints living in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], quite a number
of whom were preparing to go up to [[Zion|Zion]].
On Sunday, the 27th of April, I attended a meeting in a
school-house in Kirtland, and for the first time heard Elders
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and others speak
and bear testimony to the work of God, and much of the
Spirit of God was poured out upon the Saints.I EMBRACE THE GOSPEL.
your generation. There is no fruit of the church of Christ
upon the earth. There is no man ordained of God to
administer in any of the ordinances of the gospel of salvation
upon the earth in this day and generation. But, in the next
generation, I the Lord will set up my kingdom and my church
upon the earth, and the fruits of the kingdom and church of
Christ, such as have followed the prophets, apostles and saints
in every dispensation, shall again be found in all their fullness
upon the earth. You will live to see the day, and handle the
fruit; but will never partake of it in the flesh.' "
When the old [[Robert Mason|prophet]] had finished relating the vision and
interpretation, he said to me, calling me by my christian
name: "I shall never partake of this fruit in the flesh; but
you will, and you will become a conspicuous actor in that
kingdom." He then turned and left me. These were the
last words he ever spoke to me upon the earth.
This was a very striking circumstance, as I had spent many
hours and days, during twenty years, with this old Father
Mason, and he had never named this vision to me before.
But at the beginning of this last conversation, he told me that
he felt impelled by the Spirit of the Lord to relate it to me.
He had the vision about the year 1800, and he related it to
me in 1830âthe same spring that the Church was organized.
This vision, with his other teachings to me, made a great
impression upon my mind, and I prayed a great deal to the
Lord to lead me by His Spirit, and prepare me for His church
when it did come.
In 1832, I left [[Connecticut|Connecticut]], and traveled with my eldest
[[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|brother]] to [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]], New York; and in the winter of
1833, I saw, for the first time in my life, an [[Zerah Pulsipher|Elder]] of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He preached
in a school-house near where I lived. I attended the meet-
ing, and the Spirit of the Lord bore record to me that what
I heard was true. I invited the Elder to my house, and next
day I, with my eldest brother, went down into the water and
was baptized. We were the first two baptized in Oswego
County, New York.
When I was baptized I thought of what the old prophet
had said to me.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
apostles, dreams, visions and revelations in the church of 
Christ, the same as they had who lived in ancient days; and 
he believed the Lord would raise up a people and a church, 
in the last days, with prophets, apostles and all the gifts, 
powers and blessings, which it ever contained in any age of 
the world.
The people called this man, the old prophet [[Robert Mason|Mason]].
He frequently came to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house when I was a 
boy, and taught me and my brothers those principles; and I 
believed him.
This prophet prayed a great deal, and he had dreams and 
visions, and the Lord showed him many things, by visions, 
which were to come to pass in the last days.
I will here relate one vision, which he related to me. The 
last time I ever saw him, he said: "I was laboring in my 
field at mid-day when I was enwrapped in a vision. I was 
placed in the midst of a vast forest of fruit trees: I was 
very hungry, and walked a long way through the orchard, 
searching for fruit to eat; but I could not find any in the 
whole orchard, and I wept because I could find no fruit. 
While I stood gazing at the orchard, and wondering why 
there was no fruit, the trees began to fall to the ground upon 
every side of me, until there was not one tree standing in the 
whole orchard; and while I was marveling at the scene, I saw 
young sprouts start up from the roots of the trees which had 
fallen, and they opened into young, thrifty trees before my 
eyes. They budded, blossomed, and bore fruit until the trees 
were loaded with the finest fruit I ever beheld, and I rejoiced
to see so much fine fruit. I stepped up to a tree and picked 
my hands full of fruit, and marveled at its beauty, and as 
I was about to taste of it the vision closed, and I found 
myself in the field in the same place I was at the commence-
ment of the vision.
"I then knelt upon the ground, and prayed unto the Lord, 
and asked Him, in the name of Jesus Christ, to show me the 
meaning of the vision. The Lord said unto me: 'This is the 
interpretation of the vision: the great trees of the forest 
represented the generation of men in which you live. There is 
no church of Christ, or kingdom of God upon the earth in LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.

FOR the benefit of the young Latter-day Saints, for whom 
the Faith-Promoting Series is especially designed, I will 
relate some incidents from my experience. I will commence 
by giving a short account of some events of my childhood 
and youth.
I spent the first years of my life under the influence of what 
history has called the "Blue Laws" of Connecticut.
No man, boy, or child of any age was permitted to play, or 
do any work from sunset Saturday night, until Sunday night. 
After sunset on Sunday evening, men might work, and boys 
might jump, shout, and play as much as they pleased.
Our parents were very strict with us on Saturday night, 
and all day Sunday we had to sit very still and say over the 
Presbyterian catechism and some passages in the Bible.
The people of Connecticut in those days thought it wicked 
to believe in any religion, or belong to any church, except the 
Presbyterian. They did not believe in having any prophets, 
apostles, or revelations, as they had in the days of Jesus, and 
as we now have in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints.
There was an aged man in Connecticut, however, by the 
name of [[Robert Mason|Robert Mason]], who did not believe like the rest of 
the people. He believed it was necessary to have prophetsCONTENTS.

Satan, knowing the power for good that Brother Woodruff
would be, if permitted to live, has often sought to effect his 
destruction.
The adventures, accidents and hair-breath escapes that he 
has met with, are scarcely equalled by the record that the for-
mer apostle, Paul, has left us of his life.
The power of God has been manifested in a most remarkable 
manner in preserving Brother Woodruf's life. Considering 
the number of bones he has had broken, and the other bodily 
injuries he has received, it is certainly wonderful that now, at 
the age of seventy-five years, he is such a sound, well-pre-
served man. God grant that his health and usefulness may 
continue for many years to come.
Of course, this volume contains but a small portion of the 
interesting experience of Brother Woodruff's life, but very 
many profitable lessons may be learned from it, and we trust 
at some future time to be favored with other sketches from 
his pen.
THE PUBLISHER.PREFACE.
ABOUT nine months have elapsed since the first edition of 
this work was published, and now the whole number 
issuedâover 4,000 copiesâare exhausted, and there is a 
demand for more.
We, therefore, have much pleasure in offering the Second 
Edition of LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL for public consider-
ation, and trust that the young people who pursue it will be 
inspired to emulate in their lives the faith, perseverance and 
integrity that so distinguish its author.
Brother Woodruff is a remarkable man. Few men now 
living, who have followed the quiet and peaceful pursuits of 
life, have had such an interesting and eventful experience as 
he has. Few, if any in this age, have spent a more active 
and useful life. Certainly no man living has been more par-
ticular about recording with his own hand, in a daily journal, 
during half a century, the events of his own career and the 
things that have come under his observation. His elaborate 
journal has always been one of the principal sources from 
which the Church history has been compiled.
Possessed of wonderful energy and determination, and 
mighty faith, Brother WoÎ¿kruff has labored long and with 
great success in the Church. He has ever had a definite 
object in viewâto know the will of the Almighty and to do it. 
No amount of self-denial has been too great for him to cheer-
fully endure for the advancement of the cause of God. No 
labor required of the Saints has been considered by him too 
onerous to engage in with his own hands.

After holding several meetings in the town of [[Colebrook, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Colebrook]], 
and visiting my half sister, [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice Woodruff]], who was teach-
ing school there, I proceeded to [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], the place of my birth. 
There I visited many of my former neighbors and relatives, 
and the grave of my mother, [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|Bulah Woodruff]], who died June 
11th, 1808, when twenty-six years of age. The following verse 
was upon her tombstone:
âA pleasing form, a generous heart, 
A good companion, just without art; 
Just in her dealings, faithful to her friend, 
Beloved through life, lamented in the end."
At the close of the day I walked six miles to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], 
where my father, [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Aphek Woodruff]], was living, and I had the 
happy privilege of once more meeting with him and my step-
mother, whom I had not seen for seven years. They greeted 
me with great kindness, and it was a happy meeting.
After visiting with my father a day or two, I returned to 
Avon, where most of my relatives lived, and held meetings 
with them, and on the 12th of June, 1837, I baptized my 
uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]], his wife [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah]], and his son [[John Henry Woodruff|John]], 
and we rejoiced together, for this was in fulfillment of a dream 
I had in 1818, when I was eleven years of age.
On the 15th of July I had an appointment to preach at the 
house of my uncle, [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart]]. While there I had the 
happy privilege of meeting with my wife, Phoebe W. Wood-
ruff, who had come from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] to meet me and accompany 
me to her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]] home in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]], Maine.
Those who had assembled to hear me preach were relatives 
neighbors and former friends. After meeting, we returned to 
Farmington to my father's home, where I spent the night 
with my father, step-mother, sister and wife. Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] 
was also with us.
On the 19th of July, Elder Hale left us to go to his friends 
in [[New Rowley, Essex County, Massachusetts|New Rowley]], Mass., and on the same evening I held a 
meeting in the Methodist meeting-house in the town of Farm-
ington. I had a large congregation of citizens, with whom I 
had been acquainted from my youth. My parents, wife and 
sister attended the meeting. The congregation seemed satis-
fied with the doctrines I taught, and they requested me toSICK HEALED BY THE LAYING ON OF HANDS.
upon her head and commanded the devil, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, to depart out of her. It was immediately done, 
and the woman arose with great joy, and gave thanks and 
praise unto God; for, according to her faith, she was made 
whole from that hour.
A child, also, that was sick, was healed by the laying on of 
hands, according to the word of God.
We walked thirty miles to visit another branch of the 
Saints at [[Leeds Township, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Leeds]], where we met with [[John Gordon|John Gordon]] and John 
Snider. Here we held a meeting and bore our testimony to 
the people.
A Sister [[Irvin B. Carnes|Carns]] here came to us and requested to have the 
ordinance for the healing of the sick performed for two of 
her children who were afflicted. One was a suckling child, 
which was lying at the point of death. I took it in my arms 
and presented it before the Elders, who laid their hands upon 
it, and it was made whole immediately, and I handed it back 
to the mother entirely healed.
We afterwards laid hands upon the other, when it was also 
healed. It was done by the power of God, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, and the parents praised God for His goodness.
After leaving the Saints in this place, we returned to Kings-
ton, and crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]] in company with [[Isaac Russell|Isaac Russell]], 
[[John Goodson|John Goodson]] and John Snider.
Brother Russell seemed to be constantly troubled with evil 
spirits, which followed him when he subsequently went upon 
a mission to [[England|England]], where Apostles [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and Heber 
C. Kimball, when administering to him, had a severe contest 
with them, as Brother Kimball has related in his history.
Brothers Russell, Goodson and Snider continued with us to 
[[Schenectady, Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]], where they left us to proceed to [[New York|New York]], to 
join Elders Kimball and Hyde to go upon their mission to 
England.
After leaving these brethren we traveled by rail to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]], 
and walked from there to [[Canaan, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Canaan]], Conn., where we found a 
branch of the Church, including [[Jesse Moses|Jesse]] and [[Julian Moses|Julian Moses]] and 
[[Francis K. Benedict|Francis K. Benedict]].
We held a two-days' meeting with the Saints in Canaan, 
and I ordained Julian Moses and Francis K. Benedict Elders.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.

I felt impressed by the Spirit of God to take a mission 
to the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]], situated east of the [[Maine|Maine]] shore, a country I 
knew nothing about. I made my feelings known to the 
Apostles, and they advised me to go.
Feeling that it was my duty to go upon this mission, I did 
not tarry at home one year after having married a [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]], as the 
law of Moses would have allowed. On the contrary, I started 
just one month and one day after that important event, leav-
ing my wife with Sister [[Olive Boynton Hale|Hale]], with whom she expected to 
stay for a season.
I left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] in good spirits, in company with Elder 
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan H. Hale]], and walked twelve miles to [[Fairport Harbor, Lake County, Ohio|Fairport]], where we 
were joined by Elder [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]. There we went aboard 
the steamer Sandusky, and made our way to [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]], and pro-
ceeded thence to [[Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York|Syracuse]], by way of the [[Erie, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie Canal]]. We 
then walked to [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]], Oswego Co., N. Y., where I met 
my two brothers, whom I had not seen for several years.
After spending one night there, we continued our journey 
to [[Sackets Harbor, Jefferson County, New York|Sackett's Harbor]], and crossed [[Lake Ontario, United States|Lake Ontario]] on the steamer 
Oneida, to [[Kingston, Frontenac County, Canada West, British North America|Kingston]], Upper Canada, and from there also by 
steamer along the canal to [[Jones Falls, Canada West, British North America|Jones' Falls]], whence we walked to 
a place called [[Bastard, Leeds County, Canada West, British North America|Bastard]], Leeds County.
Here we found a branch of the Church, presided over by 
[[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and [[James Blakesley|James Blakesly]]. We accompanied them 
to their place of meeting, and attended a conference with 
them, at which three hundred members of the Church were 
represented.
Thirty-two persons presented themselves for ordination, 
whom I was requested to ordain, in company with Elder Wm. 
Draper. We ordained seven Elders, nine Priests, eleven 
Teachers and five Deacons.
We spoke to the people several times during this conf-
erence, and at its close we were called upon to administer to a 
woman who was possessed of the devil. At times she was 
dumb, and greatly afflicted with the evil spirits that dwelt in 
her. She believed in Jesus and in us as His servants, and 
wished us to administer to her. Four of us laid our handsI RECEIVE MY ENDOWMENTSâATTEND SCHOOL.
President of the Twelve Apostles, presided. All the branches 
in [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[Kentucky|Kentucky]] were represented.
Brothers [[Randolph Alexander|Randolph Alexander]], [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Benjamin L. Clapp]] and 
[[Johnston F. Lane|Johnson F. Lane]] were ordained Elders and [[Lindsey Anderson Brady|Lindsay Bradey]] 
was ordained to the lesser Priesthood.
I assisted President [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Marsh]] to obtain fifteen hundred dollars 
from the Southern brethren, to enter land in [[Missouri|Missouri]] for the 
Church. The brethren made me a present of fifty dollars, 
which I sent by President Marsh to enter forty acres of land 
for me. Elder [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] and I were released from the Southern 
mission with permission to go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]].

HAVING returned from my Southern mission in the 
autumn of 1836, in company with Elders [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] 
and [[Jesse Turpin|Jesse Turpin]], I spent the following winter in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. 
During this time I received my endowments and attended the 
school of Professor [[H. M. Hawes|Haws]], who taught Greek, Latin and 
English grammar. I confined my studies mostly to Latin and English grammar.
This winter and the following spring, in some respects, may 
be regarded as one of the most interesting periods of the history 
of the Church, when we consider the endowments and teach-
ings given in the temple, and the great apostasy which 
followed.
I was married to Miss Phoebe Whitmore Carter, on the 
13th of April, 1837, and received my patriarchal blessingLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
I was invited to hold a meeting at a Baptist meeting house
on the 27th of June. On my arrival I met a large congrega-
tion; but, on commencing meeting, [[Parson Browning|Parson Browning]] ordered
the meeting to be closed. I told the people I had come ten
miles to preach the gospel to them, and was willing to stand
in a cart, on a pile of wood, on a fence, or any other place
they would appoint, to have that privilege.
One man said he owned the fence and land in front of the
meeting-house, and we might use both, for he did not believe
"Mormonism" would hurt either.
So the congregation crossed the road, took down the fence
and made seats of it, and I preached to them one hour and a 
half. At the close Mr. [[Randolph Alexander|Randolph Alexander]] bore testimony
to the truth of what had been said. He invited me home
with him, bought a Book of Mormon, and was baptized, and
I organized a branch in that place.
On the 18th of July, Brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|A. O. Smoot]] and I arrived at 
a ferry on the [[Tennessee River, United States|Tennessee river]], and, as the ferryman was not
at home, the woman kindly gave us permission to use the
ferryboat. We led our horses on board, and took the oars to
cross the river. Brother Smoot had never used an oar, and I 
had not for some years, so we made awkward work of it.
Soon he broke one oar, and I let another fall overboard, which 
left us only one broken oar to get to shore with. We narrowly
escaped running into a steamboat. We struck shore half a
mile below the landing place, tied up the boat, jumped on
the bank with our horses, and went on our way with blistered
hands, thankful to get off so well.
On Sunday, the 31st of July, A. O. Smoot and I preached
at Mr. [[David Crider|David Crider's]], [[Weakley County, Tennessee|Weakly County, Tennessee]]. After
the meeting Mr. Crider was baptized. A mob gathered and
threatened us, and poisoned our horses so that the one I rode, 
belonging to [[Samuel Walker West|Samuel West]], died a few days after. This horse
had carried me thousands of miles while preaching the gospel.
I continued to travel with Brothers Smoot, [[David Wyman Patten|Patten]] and 
[[Warren Farr Parrish|Parrish]] in [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[Kentucky|Kentucky]], and we baptized all who
would receive our testimony.
On the 2nd day of September we held a general conference

brethren were condemned; but were finally released by paying
the expense of the mob court.
There was one peculiar circumstance connected with this
trial by a mob court, which was armed to the teeth. When
the trial was through with, the people were not willing to
permit more than one to speak. [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parish]] had said but
few words, and they were not willing to let David Patten
speak. But he, feeling the injustice of the court, and being
filled with the power of God, arose to his feet and delivered a
speech of about twenty minutes, holding them spell-bound
while he told them of their wickedness and the abominations
that they were guilty of, also of the curse of God that awaited
them, if they did not repent, for taking up two harmless, 
inoffensive men for preaching the gospel of Christ.
When he had got through his speech the judge said, "You
must be armed with secret weapons, or you would not talk in
this fearless manner to an armed court."
Brother Patten replied; "I have weapons that you know
not of, and they are given me of God, for He gives me all the
power I have."
The judge seemed willing to get rid of them almost upon
any terms, and offered to dismiss them if their friends would
pay the costs, which the brethren present freely offered to do.
When the two were released, they mounted their horses and
rode a mile to [[Seth Utley|Seth Utley's]]; but, as soon as they had left, the
court became ashamed that they had been let go so easily
and the whole mob mounted their horses to follow them to
Utley's.
One of the Saints, seeing the state of affairs, went on
before the mob to notify the brethren, so that they had time
to ride into the woods near by.
They traveled along about three miles to Brother Albert
Petty's, and went to bed. The night was dark, and they fell 
asleep.
But Brother Patten was warned in a dream to get up and 
flee, as the mob would soon be there. They both arose,
saddled their animals, and rode into the adjoining County.
The house they had just left was soon surrounded by the
mob, but the brethren had escaped through the mercy of God.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
After conference I took Brothers [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] and [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|Clapp]] with me
to preach. The former traveled with me constantly till the
21st of April, when we had the privilege of meeting with
Elder [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]], who had come direct from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]],
and who had been ordained one of the Twelve Apostles.
It was a happy meeting. He gave us an account of the 
endowments at Kirtland, the glorious blessings received, the
ministration of angels, the organization of the Twelve Apostles
and Seventies, and informed me that I was appointed a member
of the second quorum of Seventies. All of this was glorious
news to me, and caused my heart to rejoice.
On the 27th of May we were joined by Elder Warren
Parrish, direct from Kirtland. We had a happy time 
together.
On the 28th, we held a conference at Brother [[Seth Utley|Seth Utley's]],
where were represented all the branches of the Church in the
South.
I was ordained on the 31st of May a member of the second
quorum of Seventies under the hands of David W. Patten and
Warren Parrish.
At the close of the conference we separated for a short time.
Elders Patten and Parrish labored in [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], Brother, 
Smoot and myself in [[Kentucky|Kentucky]]. On the 9th of June we all
met at [[Damon Creek, Calloway County, Kentucky|Damon Creek]] Branch, where Brother Patten baptized
two. One was Father [[Henry Thomas Sr.|Henry Thomas]], who had been a revo-
lutionary soldier under General [[George Washington|Washington]], and father of
[[Daniel Stillwell Thomas|Daniel]] and [[Henry Thomas|Henry Thomas]].
A warrant was issued, on the oath of a priest, against
D. W. Patten, W. Parrish and myself. We were accused in
the warrant of the great "crime" of testifying that Christ
would come in this generation, and that we promised the
Holy Ghost to those whom we baptized. Brothers Patten and 
Parrish were taken on the 19th of June. I being in another
County, escaped being arrested. The brethren were put under
two thousand dollars bonds to appear at court. [[Albert Petty|Albert Petty]]
and Seth Utley were their bondsmen.
They were tried on the 22nd of June. They pleaded their
own cause. Although men came forward and testified they
did receive the Holy Ghost after they were baptized, theSUMMARY OF MY LABORS DURING THE YEAR.

I SPENT the fore part of January, 1836 (the weather being
very cold) at the house of A. O. Smoot, in [[Kentucky|Kentucky]],
studying Kirkham's English Grammar. I continued to travel
and preach in Kentucky and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] and baptized all that
would believe my testimony.
On the 26th of February we held a conference at the house
of Brother [[Lewis Clapp|Lewis Clapp]] (father of [[Benjamin Lynn Clapp|B. L. Clapp]]). There were
represented one hundred and three members in that mission.
I ordained A. O. Smoot and [[Benjamin Boydston|Benjamin Boyston]] Elders, and 
[[Daniel Stillwell Thomas|Daniel Thomas]] and Benjamin L. Clapp Priests. I also
ordained one Teacher and two Deacons.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
On the following day I preached at the house of Benjamin
L. Clapp and baptized seven Campbellites and one Baptist.
On the 16th of November I preached at Brother Camp's
and baptized three. On the day following, it being Sunday,
I preached again at Brother Clapp's, and baptized five. At
the close of the meeting I mounted my horse to ride to Clark's
River, in company with [[Seth Utley|Seth Utley]], four other brethren and
two sisters. The distance was twenty miles.
We came to a stream, which was so swollen by rains, that
we could not cross without swimming our horses. To swim
would not be safe for the females, so we went up the stream
to find a ford. In the attempt we were overtaken by a severe
storm of wind and rain, and lost our way in the darkness, and
wandered through creeks and mud. But the Lord does not
forsake His Saints in any of their troubles. While we were
in the woods suffering under the blast of the storm, groping
like the blind for the wall, a bright light suddenly shone
around us, and revealed to us our dangerous situation on the
edge of a gulf. The light continued with us until we found
the road; we then went on our way rejoicing, though the
darkness returned and the rain continued.
We reached Brother [[Henry Thomas|Henry Thomas']] in safety about nine
o'clock at night, having been five hours in the storm and
forded streams many times. None of us felt to complain, 
but were thankful to God for His preserving care.
On the following day I preached in [[Damon Creek, Calloway County, Kentucky|Damon Creek]] and 
organized a branch called the Damon Creek Branch, and
ordained [[Daniel Stillwell Thomas|Daniel Thomas]] a Teacher.
On the 19th of December I again preached at the house of
Brother Clapp, and baptized five persons; one was a Camp-
bellite preacher.
On the following day I preached at the house of Brother
Henry Thomas, when a mob of about fifty persons collected,
headed by a Baptist preacher, who, after asking one question,
advised the mob to not lay hands on any man on account of 
his principles.
The advice was good and well taken.
At the close of the meeting I baptized three persons, one
seventy-eight years old.ADVENTURE IN [[Blood River, Henry County, Tennessee|BLOODY RIVER]].
I told him we did not really consider them essential to salva-
tion.
He said he did, and therefore should not join our
Church.
On the 4th of April, 1835, I had the happy privilege of
meeting Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]] at the house of Brother [[Joseph Fry|Frys]].
He had been preaching in that part of [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in company
with [[David Wyman Patten|David W. Patten]], and had baptized a number and organ-
ized several small branches.
Brother Patten had returned home, and Brother Parrish
was laboring alone. I joined him in the ministry, and we
labored together three months and nineteen days, when he
was called to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]].
During the time we were together we traveled through
several Counties in Tennessee for the distance of seven hun-
dred and sixty miles, and preached the gospel daily, as we had
opportunity. We baptized some twenty persons.
By the counsel of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and Oliver
Cowdery, Elder Parrish ordained me an Elder, and left me to
take charge of the branches that had been raised up in that
neighborhood.
As soon as I was left alone I extended my circuit and labors.
For a season I had large congregations; many seemed to
believe, and I baptized a number.
On the 15th of August I had an appointment at the house
of Brother [[Levi Taylor|Taylor]], the step-father of [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Abraham O. Smoot]].
I had to cross [[Blood River, Henry County, Tennessee|Bloody River]], which I had to swim in con-
sequence of heavy rains. While crossing, my horse became
entangled in a tree top, and almost drowned; but I succeeded
in getting him loose.
We swam to the shore separately. He reached the shore
first, and waited till I came out. I got into the saddle, and
went on my way in good spirits, and had a good meeting.
On the 20th of October I baptized three Campbellites, one
of whom was a deacon. I then rode twelve miles to Mr. 
[[Joseph Greenwood|Greenwood's]], who was eighty years old, and had been a soldier
under General [[George Washington|Washington]]. His [[Elizabeth Greenwood|wife]], who was ninety-three
years old, I found quite smart, and busy carding wool. I
preached at their house and baptized both of them. LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
would give to me. I arose and spoke one hour and a half and
it was one of the best sermons of my life.
The lives of the congregation were opened to the vision of
my mind, and I told them of their wicked deeds and the
reward they would obtain. The men who surrounded me
dropped their heads. Three minutes after I closed I was the
only person in the room.
Soon I was shown to a bed, and in a room adjoining a large one
in which were assembled many of the men whom I had been 
preaching to. I could hear their conversation.
One man said he would like to know how that "Mormon"
boy knew of their past lives.
In a little while they got to disputing about some doctrinal
point. One suggested calling me to decide the point. The
[[Josiah Jackson|landlord]] said, "no; we have had enough for once."
In the morning, I had a good breakfast. The landlord said
if I came that way again to stop at his house, and stay as long
as I might choose.

AFTER leaving [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], I traveled through the country
to [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and preached on the way as I had
opportunity.
I stopped one night with a [[Squire Hardman|Squire Hardman]], an Episco-
palian.
Most of the night was spent by the family in music and 
dancing.
In the morning, at the breakfast table, Mr. Hardman asked
me if we believed in music and dancing.COMPELLED TO PREACH.
I did not blame him, as all the preachers he had ever been
acquainted with rode on fine horses or in fine carriages, clothed
in broadcloth, and had large salaries, and would see this
whole world sink to perdition before they would wade through
one hundred and seventy miles of mud to save the people.
The [[Josiah Jackson|landlord]] wanted a little fun, so he said he would
keep me if I would preach.  He wanted to see if I could
preach.
I must confess that by this time I became a little mischiev-
ous, and pleaded with him not to set me preaching.
The more I plead to be excused, the more determined Mr.
Jackson was that I should preach. He took my valise, and
the landlady got me a good supper.
I sat down in a large hall to eat supper. Before I got
through, the room began to be filled by some of the rich and
fashionable of [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], dressed in their broadcloth and
silk, while my appearance was such as you can imagine, after
traveling through the mud as I had been.
When I had finished eating, the table was carried out of
the room over the heads of the people. I was placed in the 
corner of the room, with a stand having a Bible, hymn book
and candle on it, hemmed in by a dozen men, with the land-
lord in the center.
There were present some five hundred persons who had
come together, not to hear a gospel sermon, but to have some
fun.
Now, boys, how would you like this position? On your 
first mission, without a companion or friend, and to be called
upon to preach to such a congregation! With me it was
one of the most pleasing hours of my life, although I felt as
though I should like company.
I read a hymn, and asked them to sing. Not a soul would
sing a word.
I told them I had not the gift of singing; but with the
help of the Lord, I would both pray and preach. I knelt
down to pray, and the men around me dropped on their
knees. I prayed to the Lord to give me His Spirit and to 
show me the hearts of the people. I promised the Lord in my 
prayer I would deliver to that congregation whatever He
1*LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
We traveled about fifty miles that day, and at night stopped 
at an old tavern, in a village called [[Cadron Creek, Arkansas Territory|Cadron]], which 
was deserted because it was believed to be haunted by evil 
spirits.
We made a fire in the tavern, roasted a piece of our pork, 
ate our supper, said our prayers, went into a chamber, lay 
down on the bare floor, and were soon asleep.
I dreamed I was at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] house in a good feather bed, 
and I had a good night's rest. When I awoke the bed vanished, 
and I found myself on the bare floor and well rested, not 
having been troubled with evil spirits or anything else.
We thanked the Lord for His goodness to us, ate the 
remainder of our provisions and continued our journey down 
the river to [[Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas Territory|Little Rock]], the capital of [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], which then 
consisted of only a few cabins.
After visiting the place, we crossed the river and tied up 
our canoe, which had carried us safely one hundred and fifty 
miles.
We then took the old military road, leading from Little 
Rock to [[Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee. This road lay through swamps, 
and was covered with mud and water most of the way, for one 
hundred and seventy miles. We walked forty miles in a day 
through mud and water knee deep.
On the 24th of March, after traveling some ten miles through 
mud, I was taken lame with a sharp pain in my knee. I sat 
down on a log.
My companion, who was anxious to get to his home in 
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], left me sitting in an alligator swamp. I did not see 
him again for two years. I knelt down in the mud and 
prayed, and the Lord healed me, and I went on my way 
rejoicing.
On the 27th of March, I arrived at Memphis, weary and 
hungry. I went to the best tavern in the place, kept by Mr. 
[[Josiah Jackson|Josiah Jackson]]. I told him I was a stranger, and had no 
money. I asked him if he would keep me over night.
He inquired of me what my business was.
I told him I was a preacher of the gospel.
He laughed, and said that I did not look much like a 
preacher.MR. [[Alexander Akeman|AKEMAN]] DROPS DEAD.
each time he railed against me, and the last time he ordered 
me out of his house. When I went out he followed me and 
was very angry. When he came up to me, about eight rods 
from the house, he fell dead at my feet, turned black and 
swelled up, as I saw the serpents do in my dream.
His family, as well as ourselves, felt it was the judgment of 
God upon him. I preached his funeral sermon. Many of 
the mob died suddenly. We stayed about two weeks after 
Akeman's death and preached, baptized Mr. [[Jonathan Hubbel|Hubbel]] and his [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|wife]], and then continued on our journey.

WE concluded to go down Arkansas river and cross into [[Tennessee|Tennessee]]. We could not get passage on the boat, 
because of the low water, so we went on the bank of the river 
and cut down a sound cottonwood tree, three feet through, 
and cut off a twelve-foot length from the butt end; and in two 
days we dug out a canoe. We made a pair of oars and a 
rudder, and on the 11th of March, 1835, we launched our 
canoe, and commenced our voyage down the Arkansas river, 
without provisions.
The first day we sailed twenty-five miles, and stopped at 
night with a poor family who lived on the bank of the river. 
These kind folks gave us supper and breakfast, and, in the 
morning, gave us a johnny cake and piece of pork to take 
with us on our journey.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
the room was filled with large serpents, and I shuddered at 
the sight. My companion said he would not go into the room 
for fear of the serpents. I told him I should try to go through 
the room though they killed me, for the Lord had commanded 
it. As I stepped into the room the serpents coiled themselves 
up, and raised their heads some two feet from the floor, to 
spring at me. There was one much larger than the rest in 
the center of the room, which raised his head nearly as high 
as mine and made a spring at me. At that instant I felt as 
though nothing but the power of God could save me, and I 
stood still. Just before the serpent reached me he dropped 
dead at my feet; all the rest dropped dead, swelled up, turned 
black, burst open, took fire and were consumed before my 
eyes, and we went through the room unharmed, and thanked 
God for our deliverance.
I awoke in the morning and pondered upon the dream. 
We took breakfast, and started on our journey on Sunday 
morning, to visit Mr. [[Alexander Akeman|Akeman]]. I related to my companion 
my dream, and told him we should see something strange. 
We had great anticipations of meeting Mr. Akeman, suppos-
ing him to be a member of the Church. When we arrived at 
his house he received us very coldly, and we soon found that 
he had apostatized. He brought railing accusations against 
the Book of Mormon and the authorities of the Church.
Word was sent through all the settlements on the river for 
twenty miles that two "Mormon" preachers were in the place. 
A mob was soon raised, and warning sent to us to leave 
immediately or we would be tarred and feathered, ridden on a 
rail and hanged. I soon saw where the serpents were. My 
companion wanted to leave; I told him no, I would stay and 
see my dream fulfilled.
There was an old [[Jonathan Hubbel|gentleman]] and [[Sister Jonathan Hubbel|lady]], named Hubbel, who 
had read the Book of Mormon and believed. Father Hubbell 
came to see us, and invited us to make our home with him 
while we stayed in the place. We did so, and labored for him 
some three weeks with our axes, clearing land, while we were 
waiting to see the salvation of God.
I was commanded of the Lord by the Holy Ghost to go 
and warn Mr. Akeman to repent of his wickedness. I did so, andJOURNEY TO [[Alexander Akeman|AKEMAN'S]].

IN the early days of the Church, it was a great treat to an 
Elder in his travels through the country to find a "Mor-
mon;" it was so with us. We were hardly in [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]] when 
we heard of a family named Akeman. They were in Jackson 
County in the persecutions. Some of the sons had been tied 
up there and whipped on their bare backs with hickory switches 
by the mob. We heard of their living on [[Petit Jean River, Arkansas Territory|Petit Jean River]], in 
the Arkansas Territory, and we went a long way to visit them.
There had recently been heavy rains, and a creek that we had 
to cross was swollen to a rapid stream of eight rods in width. 
There was no person living nearer than two miles from the 
crossing, and no boat. The people living at the last house 
on the road, some three miles from the crossing, said we would 
have to tarry till the water fell before we could cross. We did 
not stop, feeling to trust in God.
Just as we arrived at the rolling flood a negro, on a powerful 
horse, entered the stream on the opposite side and rode 
through it. On our making our wants known to him, he took 
us, one at a time, behind him and carried us safely over, and 
we went on our way rejoicing.
We arrived that night within five miles of Mr. Akeman's, 
and were kindly entertained by a stranger. During the 
night I had the following dream:
I thought an angel came to us, and told us we were com-
manded of the Lord to follow a certain straight path, which 
was pointed out to us, let it lead us wherever it might. After 
we had walked in it awhile we came to the door of a house, 
which was in the line of a high wall running north and south, 
so that we could not go around. I opened the door and sawLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
feet, and ran around the room as though he was frightened; 
but he was quieted when we informed him we were friends.
The cause of his fright was, he had shot a panther a few 
nights before, and he thought its mate had jumped upon 
him.
He asked us what we wanted; we told him we wished to 
stop with him all night, and would like something to eat. He 
informed us we might lay on the floor as he did, but that he 
had not a mouthful for us to eat, as he had to depend on his 
gun to get breakfast for his family in the morning. So we 
lay on the bare floor, and slept through a long, rainy night, 
which was pretty hard after walking sixty miles without any-
thing to eat. That was the hardest day's work of my life.
The man's name was Williams. He was in the mob in
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]; and after the Saints were driven out, he, 
with many others, went south.
We got up in the morning and walked in the rain twelve 
miles to the house of a man named Bemon, who was also 
one of the mob from Jackson County. They were about 
sitting down to breakfast as we came in.
In those days it was the custom of the Missourians to ask 
you to eat even if they intended to cut your throat as soon as 
you got through; so he asked us to take breakfast, and we 
were very glad of the invitation.
He knew we were "Mormons;" and as soon as we began to 
eat he began to swear about the "Mormons." He had a large 
platter of bacon and eggs, and plenty of bread on the table, 
and his swearing did not hinder our eating, for the harder he 
swore the harder we ate, until we got our stomachs full; 
then we arose from the table, took our hats, thanked him for 
our breakfast, and the last we heard of him he was still 
swearing.
I trust the Lord will reward him for our breakfast.CONFRONTED BY A BEAR.
Cease your exertions to destroy this people, or God will bring 
you to judgment and destroy your nation, and cast you into 
outer darkness, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of 
teeth; for the Lord God has spoken it. I must pause; I almost 
forgot I was writing a narrative.
We started about sunrise and crossed a thirty mile prairie, 
apparently as level as a house floor, without shrub or water. 
We arrived at timber about two o'clock in the afternoon. As 
we approached the timber a large black bear came out towards 
us. We were not afraid of him, for we were on the Lord's 
business, and had not mocked God's prophets as did the forty-
two wicked children who said to Elisha "Go up thou bald
head," for which they were torn by bears.
When the bear got within eight rods of us he sat on his 
haunches and looked at us a moment, and then ran away; and 
we went on our way rejoicing. We had to travel in the night, 
which was cloudy and very dark, so we had great difficulty to 
keep the road. Soon a large drove of wolves gathered around, 
and followed us. They came very close, and at times it 
seemed as though they would eat us up.
We had materials for striking alight, and at ten o'clock, not 
knowing where we were, and the wolves becoming so bold, we 
thought it wisdom to make a fire; so we stopped and gathered 
a lot of oak limbs that lay on the ground, and lit them, and 
as our fire began to burn the wolves left us.
As we were about to lay down on the groundâfor we had 
no blanketsâwe heard a dog bark.
My companion said it was a wolf; I said it was a dog: but 
soon we heard a cow bell. Then we each took a firebrand and 
went about a quarter of a mile, and found the house, which 
was sixty miles from where we started that morning.
It was an old log cabin, about twelve feet square, with no 
door, but an old blanket was hung up in the door-way. There 
was no furniture except one bedstead, upon which lay a woman, 
several children and several small dogs. A man lay on the 
bare floor with his feet to the fireplace, and all were asleep. 
I went in and spoke to the man, but did not wake him. I 
stepped to him, and laid my hand on his shoulder. The 
moment he felt the weight of my hand he jumped to his LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
We were soon surrounded by Osage Indians, and kindly 
received by [[Michael Geraud|Mr. Jereu]] and his [[Mrs. Michael Geraud|wife]], who was an Indian. She 
gave us an excellent supper and a good bed, which we were 
thankful for after the fatigue of the day.
As I laid my head on my pillow I felt to thank God, from 
the bottom of my heart, for the exchange of the barbarous 
treatment of a civilized Presbyterian priest, for the humane, 
kind and generous treatment of the savage Osage Indians.
May God reward them both according to their deserts.

TOGETHER.
WE arose in the morning, after a good night's rest. I was 
somewhat lame, from wading in the swamp the night 
before. We had a good breakfast. [[Michael Geraud|Mr. Jereu]] sent an Indian 
to see us across the [[Osage River, Missouri|river]], and informed us that it was sixty 
miles to the nearest settlement of either white or red men.
We were too bashful to ask for anything to take with us to 
eat; so we crossed the river and started on our day's journey 
of sixty miles without a morsel of food of any kind. What 
for? To preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, to save this gen-
eration.
Think of this, children; think of what the Presidency 
the Apostles, and the Elders of this Church have passed 
through to give you the homes and comforts you now enjoy.
Think of this, ye statesmen and judges of this American 
nation; ye who are now seeking to destroy God's people in 
the wilderness, who have gone hungry and naked and have 
labored for fifty years to save this nation and generation.REFUSED FOOD AND SHELTER.
In some instances the Lord preserved us, as it were by 
miracle, from the mob.
We dared not go to houses and get food, so we picked and 
ate raw corn, and slept on the ground, and did any way we 
could until we got out of the [[Jackson County, Missouri|County]].
We dared not preach while in that County, and we did but 
little preaching in the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]]. The first time I 
attempted to preach was on Sunday, in a tavern, in the early 
part of December, 1834. It was snowing at the time, and the 
room was full of people. As I commenced to speak the land-
lord opened the door, and the snow blew on the people; and 
when I inquired the object of having the door opened in a 
snowstorm, he informed me that he wanted some light on the 
subject. I found that it was the custom of the country.
How much good I did in that sermon I never knew, and 
probably never shall know until I meet that congregation in 
judgment.
In the southern portion of Missouri and the northern part 
of [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], in 1834, there were but very few inhabitants.
We visited a place called [[Harmony Mission, Bates County, Missouri|Harmony Mission]], on the Osage 
river, one of the most crooked rivers in the west. This mis-
sion was kept by a Presbyterian minister and his family.
We arrived there on Sunday night at sunset. We had
walked all day with nothing to eat, and were very hungry and 
tired. Neither the minister nor his wife would give us any-
thing to eat, nor let us stay overnight, because we were 
âMormons," and the only chance we had was to go twelve 
miles farther down the river, to an Osage Indian trading 
post, kept by a Frenchman named [[Michael Geraud|Jereu]]. And this wicked 
priest, who would not give us a piece of bread, lied to us 
about the road, and sent us across the swamp, and we wallowed 
knee deep in mud and water till ten o'clock at night in try-
ing to follow this crooked river. We then left the swamp, 
and put out into the prairie, to lie in the grass for the night. 
When we came out of the swamp, we heard an Indian 
drumming on a tin pail and singing. It was very dark, but 
we traveled towards the noise, and when we drew near the 
Indian camp quite a number of large Indian dogs came out 
to meet us. They smelt us, but did not bark nor bite.nannannannanTHE END.
It required an angel of God to deliver the gospel to Joseph 
Smith because it was not then upon the earth, and that was 
in fulfillment of the word of the Lord through John the 
Revelator (Revelations xiv. 6). And so in regard to the 
administrations of angels in all ages of the world; it is to 
deliver a message and perform a work which cannot otherwise 
be accomplished.
[FIGURE]STRUGGLE WITH EVIL SPIRITS.
and the administrations of angels. This was marvelously ful-
filled while in the city of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] in 1840. Brothers Heber 
C. Kimball, [[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]] and I went to London 
together in the winter of 1840, being the first Elders who had 
attempted to established the gospel in that great and mighty 
city.
As soon as we commenced we found the devil was manifest; 
the evil spirits gathered for our destruction, and at times they 
had great power.
They would destroy all the Saints if they were not restrained 
by the power of God.
Brother Smith and myself were together, and had retired 
to our rest, each occupying a cot, and but three feet apart.
We had only just lain down, when it seemed as if a legion 
of devils made war upon us, to destroy us, and we were strug-
gling for our lives in the midst of this warfare of evil spirits 
until we were nearly choked to death.
I began to pray the best that I could in the midst of this 
struggle and asked the Father in the name of Jesus Christ to 
spare our lives.
While thus praying three personages entered the room, 
clothed in white and encircled with light.
They walked to our bedside, laid hands upon our heads and 
we were instantly delivered; and from that time forth we 
were no more troubled with evil spirits while in the city of 
London.
As soon as they administered unto us they withdrew from 
the room, the lights withdrew with them and darkness 
returned.
Many other sayings of the Patriarch [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] in my 
blessing have been fulfilled in my experience, but I have said 
sufficient on this subject. All the blessings that are sealed 
upon our heads will be fulfilled, and many more, if we are 
faithful and live for them.
In closing my testimony I wish to say that I do not think 
that the Lord ever sends an angel to the earth to visit the 
children of men, unless it is necessary to introduce a dispen-
sation of the gospel, or deliver a message, or perform a work 
that cannot be done otherwise.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
in the book of Enoch, and are to be testified of in due 
time."
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were Patriarchs, and blessed 
their posterity. All that Jacob said and scaled upon the 
heads of his twelve sons has been fulfilled to the very letter, 
as far as time has permitted.
We also have Patriarchs in our day. Father Joseph 
Smith, the father of the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], was the first 
Patriarch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
He gave a great many blessings unto the Saints, which are 
recorded, and many of them have seen their fulfillment.
When he put his hands on the head of a person to bless 
him, it seemed as though the heavens were opened, and he 
could reveal the whole life of that person.
He gave me my patriarchal blessing in the temple of the 
Lord at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], on the 15th day of April, 1837.
Many marvelous things which he sealed upon my head, for 
which I could then see no earthly chance of fulfillment, have 
already been fulfilled to the very letter.
One or two instances I will name. He said I should have 
access to the treasures hid in the ground to assist me in get-
ting myself and others to Zion.
When in [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] gathering up the Saints, in 1850 
[[Alexander Badlam|Alexander Badlam]] went to [[California|California]] on business, and the 
Saints who were digging gold filled a little sack with gold 
dust and sent it to me to assist me on my mission.
By the sale of this treasure from California I was enabled to 
emigrate myself, family and a number of others to Zion in 
the mountains.
He also said I should have power to bring my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and his 
family into the Church. This was fulfilled when I visited them 
during my mission to the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]], as previously related.
My father gathered to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] with the Saints, and 
he died there, aged 83 years.
The Patriarch also said I should be wrapt in the visions of 
heaven, and an angel of God should teach me many things. 
This was literally fulfilled.
Again, he told me I should be delivered from my enemies 
(who would seek my destruction) by the mighty power of GodPATRIARCHAL BLESSINGS.
temple of the Lord; and thousands of others have received 
the same blessings in the same way.
President [[Brigham Young|Young]] received revelations in that [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|temple]], and 
there are yet many revelations to be received in the last days, 
concerning the redemption of the dead and many other sub-
jects, but they will all be manifest in due time through the 
proper authority unto the Church and Kingdom of God.
There are many other manifestations of the power of God 
and the revelations of Jesus Christ to us in our lives. We 
have been called by revelation to give endowments for many 
persons now dead, who, when living, were honorable men of 
the earth, and some who were prominent in our nation, but 
who were not members of our family.
But I have said sufficient upon this branch of the sub-
ject.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
PATRIARCHAL BLESSINGS AND THEIR FULFILLMENTâPRE-
DICTIONS IN MY OWN BLESSINGâGOLD-DUST FROM 
[[California|CALIFORNIA]]âTAUGHT BY AN ANGELâSTRUGGLE WITH 
EVIL SPIRITSâADMINISTERED TO BY ANGELSâWHAT 
ANGELS ARE SENT TO THE EARTH FOR.
THE duty of a Patriarch is to bestow blessings upon his 
posterity and the children of men.
In a revelation (Doc, and Cov., Sec. 107), the Lord says that 
"Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, 
Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who 
were all High Priests, with the residue of his posterity who 
were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and 
there bestowed upon them his last blessings. * * And 
Adam * * predicted whatsoever should befall his pos-
terity unto the last generation. These things are all writtenLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
In that case it dictated me quite contrary to my expecta-
tions, for I had appointments out for a week ahead. But I 
obeyed the voice of the Spirit, went south as I was directed 
to, and my readers know the result.
I will refer to one more instance in my experience upon the 
subject of revelation:
All the Latter-day Saints understand that we build temples 
for the purpose of administering ordinances for the dead as 
well as for the living.
The Lord has opened the way in a remarkable manner for 
many of the members of the Church to obtain records of the 
names of their dead for several generations.
I had also obtained a record of somewhat over three thous-
and of my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] and [[Beulah Thompson Woodruff, b. 1782|mother's]] families.
After the dedication of the [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|temple]] at [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George]], President 
[[Brigham Young|Young]] appointed me to preside over it. When we com-
menced work in the temple I began to reflect: "How can I 
redeem my dead? I have some three thousand names of the 
dead who have been baptized for, and how can I get endow-
ments for them?"
I had none of my family there, and if they had been there 
they would not have been able to get endowments for so many.
While praying to the Lord to show me how to redeem my 
dead, the Spirit of God rested upon me, and the voice of the 
Spirit said to me, "Go and call upon the sons and the daugh-
ters of Zion in St. George, to come into the temple of the 
Lord and get their endowments for your dead; and it shall be 
acceptable unto me, saith the Lord.â
This filled my soul with joy, and I saw that it opened a field 
as wide as eternity for the salvation of our dead and the 
redemption of man, that we might magnify our calling as 
saviors upon Mount Zion.
On my birthday, March 1, 1877, the day that I was seventy 
years old, one hundred and fifty-four sisters at St. George went 
into the temple to get endowments for the same number of 
the female portion of my dead.
This principle was received by President Young and adopted 
from that hour, and through the kindness of friends I have had 
nearly two thousand of my friends receive endowments in theLOST IN A SNOW STORM.
I took my team and started early on Saturday morning. 
When I arrived at [[Woodruff, Rich County, Utah Territory|Woodruff]], the Bishop urged me to stop 
until Monday and he would go with me.
I told him, "No, I had tarried too long already."
I drove on sprightly, and when within fifteen miles of
[[Wasatch County, Utah Territory|Wasatch]], a furious snow storm overtook me, the wind blowing 
heavily in my face.
In fifteen minutes I could not see any road whatever, and 
knew not how or where to guide my horses.
I left my lines loosely on my animals, went inside my wagon, 
tied down the cover, and committed my life and guidance into 
the hands of the Lord, trusting to my horses to find the way, 
as they had twice before passed over that road.
I prayed to the Lord to forgive my sin in not obeying the 
voice of the Spirit to me, and implored Him to preserve my 
life.
My horses brought me into the Wasatch station at 9 o'clock 
in the evening, with the hubs of my wagon dragging in the 
snow.
I got my horses under cover, and had to remain there until 
the next Monday night, with the snow six feet deep on the 
level, and still snowing.
It was with great difficulty at last that I saved the lives of 
my horses by getting them into a box car and taking them to 
[[Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Ogden]]; while if I had obeyed the revelation of 
the Spirit of God to me, I should have traveled to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] over a 
good road without any storm.
As I have received the good and the evil, the fruits of 
obedience and disobedience, I think I am justified in exhorting 
all my young friends to always obey the whisperings of the 
Spirit of God, and they will always be safe.
The Spirit of God will rule over and guide all men who will 
permit it and seek for it, and this is especially necessary for 
young Elders who are laboring in the vineyard of the Lord. 
For the Lord knows where the righteous, honest and meek of 
the earth are, and will lead the Elders to them
I have already related a remarkable instance of this in my 
own experience, when the voice of the Lord came to me in 
the town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], England, in 1840.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
possession a large amount of money to make payment on their 
land purchase. This was known to some road agents in the 
vicinity, who gathered a company of robbers and went on 
ahead of Brother [[Charles Coulson Rich|Rich]] and lay in ambush, intending to kill 
the "Mormons" and rob them of their money.
Before reaching the company of robbers Brother Rich came 
to a by-path or trail. The Spirit then told him to take that 
path.
The brethren with him marveled at his course, not knowing 
that enemies awaited them, but they arrived in safety at San 
Bernardino with their lives and money, while the robbers 
wondered why their prey did not come.

TIONS IN THE [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|ST. GEORGE TEMPLE]].
I WILL now give an example from my own experience of 
the result of not obeying the voice of the Spirit.
Some years since I had a part of my family living in Ran-
dolph, Rich County. I was there on a visit, with my team, 
in the month of December.
One Monday morning my monitor, the Spirit watching 
over me, said, "Take your team and go home to Salt Lake 
City."
When I named it to my family who were at Randolph they 
urged me strongly to stop longer.
Through their persuasion I stayed until Saturday morning, 
with the Spirit continually prompting me to go home. I then 
began to feel ashamed to think that I had not obeyed the 
whisperings of the Spirit to me before.SAVED FROM A STEAM-BOAT DISASTER.
While returning to [[Utah Territory|Utah]] in 1850 with a large company of 
Saints from [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] and the east, on my arrival at [[Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Pittsburg]] I 
engaged a passage for myself and company on a steamer to St. 
Louis. But no sooner had I engaged the passage than the 
Spirit said to me, "Go not on board of that steamer, neither 
you nor your company.''
I obeyed the revelation to me, and I did not go on board, 
but took another steamer.
The first steamer started at dark, with two hundred passen-
gers on board. When five miles down the [[Ohio River, United States|Ohio river]] it took 
fire, burned the tiller ropes so that the vessel could not reach 
shore, and the lives of nearly all on board were lost either by 
fire or water. We arrived in safety at our destination, by 
obeying the revelation of the Spirit of God to us.
In another instance, after attending a large annual conference 
in [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]], and, having a good deal of business to 
attend to, I was somewhat weary, and at the close of the con-
ference I thought I would repair to my home and have a rest.
As I went into the yard the Spirit said to me, "Take your 
team and go to the farm," which is some three miles south of 
the tabernacle.
As I was hitching the horses to the wagon Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]]
asked where I was going.
I said, "To the farm."
"What for?" she asked.
"I do not know," I replied; but when I arrived there I 
found out.
The creek had overflowed, broken through my ditch, sur-
rounded my home and filled my barn-yard and pig pen. My 
wife was wading in the water, trying to turn it from the lot to 
save the home and family.
Through my own exertions I soon turned it, and prevented 
much damage that might have occurred had I not obeyed the 
voice of the Spirit.
This same Spirit of revelation has been manifested to many 
of my brethren in their labors in the kingdom of God, one of 
which I will here name.
Elder [[Charles Coulson Rich|Chas. C. Rich]] was going from [[Sacramento, Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]] to San 
Bernardino with a company of the brethren. He had in hisLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
In 1848, after my return to [[Winter Quarters, unorganized U.S. Territory|Winter Quarters]] from our 
pioneer journey, I was appointed by the Presidency of the 
Church to take my family and go to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]], to gather up the 
remnant of the Latter-day Saints and lead them to the valleys 
of the mountains.
While on my way east I put my carriage into the yard of 
one of the brethren in [[Indiana|Indiana]], and Brother [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] set 
his wagon by the side of mine, and not more than two feet 
from it.
[[Dominicus Carter|Dominicus Carter]], of [[Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Provo]], and my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and four children 
were with me. My wife, one child and I went to bed in the 
carriage, the rest sleeping in the house.
I had been in bed but a short time when a voice said to me: 
âGet up, and move your carriage."
It was not thunder, lightning or an earthquake, but the 
still, small voice of the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost.
I told my wife I must get up and move my carriage. She 
asked: "What for?"
I told her I did not know, only the Spirit told me to do it.
I got up and moved my carriage several rods, and set it by 
the side of the house.
As I was returning to bed the same Spirit said to me, ''Go 
and move your mules away from that oak tree,â which was 
about one hundred yards north of our carriage.
I moved them to a young hickory grove and tied them up. 
I then went to bed.
In thirty minutes a whirlwind caught the tree to which my 
mules had been fastened, broke it off near the ground, and 
carried it one hundred yards, sweeping away two fences in its 
course, and laid it prostrate through that yard where my 
carriage stood, and the top limbs hit my carriage as it was.
In the morning I measured the trunk of the tree which fell 
where my carriage had stood, and I found it to be five feet in 
circumference. It came within a foot of Brother Hyde's 
wagon, but did not touch it.
Thus, by obeying the revelation of the Spirit of God to me 
I saved my life and the lives of my wife and child, as well as 
my animals.
In the morning I went on my way rejoicing.INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PROPHET [[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH SMITH]].
miracles to accommodate the notions of any man who is seek-
ing for a sign.
When we have the principles of the gospel revealed to us 
through the mouth of the Savior, or by inspired prophets or 
apostles, we have no need to ask the Lord to reveal that unto 
us again.
While the priesthood is restored to the earth, and 
the revelations of God are revealed to us through the mouths 
of prophets and apostles concerning the fullness of the gospel 
âdoctrine, ordinances and principles, we should study them, 
and treasure up knowledge by faith. We should study out of 
the best books, and the Holy Ghost will bring to our remem-
brance those things which we stand in need of, in the self-same 
hour that we are called to teach the people.
But when any priest, elder, prophet, apostle, or messenger 
is sent of God to preach the gospel, gather the Saints, work 
in temples or perform any work for the Lord, and that man 
is faithful and humble before the Lord, in his prayers and 
duty, and there is any snare or evil in his path, or the 
righteous to be sought out, or danger to the emigration of the 
Saints either by sea or land, or knowledge needed in a temple, 
then the Lord will reveal to him all that is necessary to meet 
the emergency.
The teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith to President 
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and the rest of us was to obtain the Holy Spirit, 
get acquainted with it and its operations, and listen to the 
whisperings of that Spirit and obey its voice, and it soon 
will become a principle of revelation unto us.
We have found this true in our experience, and in order to 
prove whether a revelation is from God or not we follow out 
the principles revealed to us, and if we find that which was 
manifested to us prove true, we know it is from God; for 
truth is one of His attributes, and the Holy Ghost deceiveth 
no man. When a man becomes acquainted with the whisper-
ings of the Holy Ghost, which is revelation, he should be 
very careful to obey it, for his life may depend upon it.
Revelation is one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and for 
the benefit of my young friends who may read this work, I 
will give an account of a few instances from my own experience 
of listening to the revelations of the Holy Ghost to me.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.

HOW TO OBTAIN REVELATION FROM GODâ[[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH SMITH'S]] 
COURSEâSAVED FROM DEATH BY A FALLING TREE, BY 
OBEYING THE VOICE OF THE SPIRITâA COMPANY OF 
SAINTS SAVED FROM A STEAMBOAT DISASTER BY THE 
SPIRIT'S WARNINGâPLOT TO WAYLAY ELDER [[Charles Coulson Rich|C. C. RICH]]
AND PARTY FOILED BY THE SAME POWER.
IN order to obtain revelation from God, and in order to know, 
when we do obtain a revelation, whether it is from God or 
not, we must follow the teachings of the revelations of God 
unto us St. James says: "If any man lack wisdom, let him 
ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth 
not; and it shall be given him." Again, it is said,  "Ask, and 
it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it 
shall be opened unto you."
It was upon this promise that Joseph Smith went before 
the Lord and prayed in the name of Jesus Christ, and asked 
for knowledge, wisdom and understanding, in order to know 
what to do to be saved; and he proved the promise of St. 
James before the Lord, and the heavens were opened to his 
view, and the Father and Son were revealed unto him, and 
the voice of the great Eloheim unto him was: âThis is my 
beloved Son, hear ye Him."
This was the first revelation of God to him. He did 
hearken to the voice of Jesus Christ all his life afterwards, 
and received a code of revelations and the word of the Lord 
unto him as long as he dwelt in the flesh.
Joseph Smith left as strong a testimony as was ever given 
to the human family, and sealed that testament with his own 
life and blood.
We all have to pursue the same course in order to obtain 
revelations from God. But I wish to impress this truth upon 
the rising generation and all who read this testimony, that the 
Lord does not give revelations or send angels to men or workADVICE TO THE YOUNG.
Lord has given His angels charge concerning us, and they do 
all they can for our salvation.
But yet we all have our agency, to choose the good and 
refuse the evil, or choose the evil and refuse the good. The 
Lord forces no man to heaven; neither does the Lord tempt 
any man to do evil. When a man is tempted to do evil, it 
is by the power of the devil, who is an enemy to all righteous-
ness.
I feel very anxious to have our boys and girls, our young 
men and maidens, seek for that which is good.
Whenever you are tempted to do evil, turn from it. Never 
make light of any of the commandments or ordinances of the 
gospel of Christ, and when you meet with any persons who do 
it, shun their society.
Avoid the use of tobacco and strong drink, for they lead to evil.
You are laying the foundation while in the days of your 
youth, for character which will decide your destiny through 
all time and throughout all eternity, either for good or evil.
The Lord has told us by revelation (See Doc. and Cov. Sec.
130) that whatever knowledge or principle of intelligence we 
attain to in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection, 
and any person who gains more knowledge and intelligence in 
this life through his diligence and obedience than another, 
will have so much the advantage in the world to come.
Therefore, we should all strive to be diligent in obtaining 
intelligence, and bringing to pass righteousness upon our 
agency, and not wait to be commanded in all things, and great 
will be our reward in so doing.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
How many were cast out of heaven down to the earth? We 
suppose that the inhabitants of heaven here referred to
were the spirits begotten of our Father in heaven who were to 
come down to the earth and take tabernacles. How many 
were there to come down and take tabernacles? This, again, 
may be difficult to tell, yet perhaps we may come near enough 
for the purpose. It has generally been conceded that there 
are about 1,000,000,000 persons on the earth at a time, though 
the late statistics make out 1,400,000,000 at the present time. 
But we will say 1,000,000,000. It is also said that a genera-
tion passes off the earth every thirty-three and one-third 
years, making three generations in a century, which would be 
3,000,000,000 in one hundred years. Multiply this by ten 
and it will make 30,000,000,000 in 1,000 years. Multiply 
again by seven and it will make 210,000,000,000 in 7,000 
years.
The argument might be used that when our earth was first 
peopled there were but two persons on the earth, and after the 
flood but eight souls were left alive, but the probability is that 
during the millennium the inhabitants will increase very fast 
as the age of children will be as the age of a tree, and the 
inhabitants of the earth will not die off as they do now.
But we will suppose that there were 100,000,000,000 of 
fallen spirits sent down from heaven to earth, and that there 
are, 1,000,000,000 of inhabitants upon the face of the earth 
to-day, that would make one hundred evil spirits to every 
man, woman and child living on the earth; and the whole 
mission and labor of these spirits is to lead all the children of 
men to do evil and to effect their destruction.
Now, I want all our boys and girls to reflect upon this, and 
to see what danger they are in, and the warfare they have to 
pass through.
These one hundred evil spirits to each one of the children 
of men seek to lead them into every temptation possible, 
to use tobacco, smoke, drink whisky, get drunk, curse, swear, 
lie, steal, and commit adultery and murder, and do every evil 
to cut them off from exaltation as far as possible.
On the other hand, the Spirit of God labors and strives to 
preserve all the children of men from these evils; and theCLOSING TESTIMONY.
CHAPTER XXV.
CLOSING TESTIMONYâGOOD AND EVIL SPIRITS.
BEFORE closing this little book, as a reader for our chil-
dren, I wish to bear my testimony upon several principles, 
to the Latter-day Saints, especially to the rising generation, 
the young men of Israel.
First, I wish to speak of the spirits of good and evil. The 
Lord says, whatever leads to good is of God, and whatever 
leads to do evil is of the devil. This is a very important sub-
ject for us to understand.
The scriptures again tell us that there are many spirits gone 
out into the world; and that we should try the spirits, to prove 
which are of God and which are of the evil one. The New 
Testament says that every spirit that confesses that Jesus is the 
Christ, is born of God; and every spirit that denieth that 
Jesus is the Christ is anti-Christ, and is not of God. I will 
also add that every spirit that confesses that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] 
was a Prophet of God, and that the Book of Mormon, Bible 
and Doctrine and Covenants are true, is of God; and every 
spirit that denieth this is not of God, but is of the evil one.
1 wish here to ask our young friends as well as the older 
ones, the question: Do you ever consider or contemplate any-
thing about the number of evil spirits that occupy the earth, 
who are at war against God and against all good, and who 
seek to destroy all the children of men in every age of the
world?
Let us reason together a moment upon this subject. It may 
be impossible for any man, without direct revelation from God, 
to get to know the exact number, but we may approximate 
towards it.
The Lord has said by revelation that Lucifer, an angel in 
authority, rebelled against God, and drew away one-third part 
of the hosts of heaven; and he was cast down to the earth 
and the heavens wept over him.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
Brother [[John Benbow|Benbow]] furnished us with Â£300 to print the first 
Book of Mormon that was published in [[England|England]]: and on the 
20th of May, 1840, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and I 
held a council on the top of [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]], and there decided 
that Brigham Young go direct to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] and publish 
3,000 copies of the Hymn Book and 3,000 copies of the Book 
of Mormon, this being the first publication of these books in 
England.
The power of God rested upon us and upon the mission.
The sick were healed, devils were cast out, and the lame 
were made to walk.
One case I will mention: [[Mary Pitt|Mary Pitt]], who died in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], 
sister to [[William Hill Pitt|Wm. Pitt]], who died in [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]], had not 
walked upon her feet for eleven years. We carried her into 
the water and I baptized her.
On the evening of the 18th of May, 1840, at Brother 
[[Thomas Kington|Kingston's]] house in [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|Dymock]], Elders Brigham Young, Wil-
lard Richards and I laid hands upon her head and confirmed 
her.
Brigham Young, being mouth, rebuked her lameness, and 
commanded her to arise and walk, in the name of the Lord. 
The lameness then left her, and she never afterwards used a 
staff or crutch.
She walked through the town of Dymock next day, which 
created a stir among the people; but the wicked did not feel 
to give God the glory.
The whole history of this [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] mission shows the 
importance of listening to the still small voice of the Spirit of 
God and the revelations of the Holy Ghost.
The Lord had a people there prepared for the gospel. They 
were praying for light and truth, and the Lord sent me to 
them, and I declared the gospel of life and salvation unto 
them, and some eighteen hundred souls received it, and many 
of them have been gathered to Zion in these mountains. Many 
of them have also been called to officiate in the bishopric, and 
have done much good in Zion. But in all these things we 
should ever acknowledge the hand of God, and give Him the 
honor, praise and glory, forever and ever. Amen.ARCHBISHOP PETITIONED TO STOP OUR PREACHING.
The rector did not know what to make of it, so he sent two 
clerks of the Church of England as spies, to attend our meet-
ing, and find out what we did preach.
But they were both pricked in their hearts and received the 
word of the Lord gladly, and were baptized and confirmed 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The rector became alarmed and did not dare to send any-
body else.
The ministers and rectors of the South of [[England|England]] called a 
convention and sent a petition to the [[William Howley|Archbishop]] of Canter-
bury, to request parliament to pass a law prohibiting 
the âMormonsâ from preaching in the British dominion.
In this petition the rector stated that one âMormonâ mis-
sionary had baptized fifteen hundred persons, mostly members 
of the English church, during the last seven months.
But the archbishop and council, knowing well that the laws 
of England gave free toleration to all religions under the 
British flag, sent word to the petitioners that if they had the 
worth of souls at heart as much as they had the ground where 
hares, foxes and hounds ran, they would not lose so many of 
their flock.
I continued to preach and baptize daily.
On the 21st day of March I baptized Elder Thomas Kings-
ton. He was the superintendent of both preachers and 
members of the United Brethren.
The first thirty days after my arrival in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], I had 
baptized forty-five preachers and one hundred-sixty-mem-
bers of the United Brethren, who put into my hands one 
chapel and forty-five houses, which were licensed according to 
law to preach in.
This opened a wide field for labor, and enabled me to bring 
into the Church, through the blessing of God, over eighteen 
hundred souls during eight months, including all of the six-
hundred United Brethren except one person; also including 
some two hundred preachers of various denominations.
This field of labor embraced Herefordshire, [[Gloucestershire, England|Gloucestershire]] 
and [[Worcestershire, England|Worcestershire]], and formed the conferences of [[Garway, Herefordshire, England|Garway]], 
[[Gadfield Elm, Worcestershire, England|Godfield Elm]] and [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]].
I was visited by President [[Brigham Young|Young]] and Dr. [[Willard Richards|Richards]].LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
I spent most of the following day in clearing out a pool of 
water, and preparing it for baptizing in, as I saw many to be 
baptized there. I afterwards baptized six hundred in that 
pool of water.
On Sunday, the 8th, I preached at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frome's Hill]] in the 
morning, a [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Standley Hill]] in the afternoon, and at John Ben-
bow's, [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill Farm]], in the evening.
The parish church that stood in the neighborhood of 
Brother Benbow's, presided over by the rector of the 
parish, was attended during the day by only fifteen persons, 
while I had a large congregation, estimated to number a 
thousand, attend my meeting through the day and even-
ing.
When I arose in the evening to speak at Brother Benbow's 
house, a man entered the door and informed me that he was 
a constable, and had been sent by the rector of the parish 
with a warrant to arrest me.
I asked him "For what crime?"
He said, "For preaching to the people."
I told him that I, as well as the rector, had a license for 
preaching the gospel to the people, and that if he would take 
a chair I would wait upon him after meeting.
He took my chair and sat beside me. I preached the first 
principles of the everlasting gospel for an hour and a quarter. 
The power of God rested upon me, the Spirit filled the house, 
and the people were convinced.
At the close of the meeting I opened a door for baptism, 
and seven offered themselves. Among the number were four 
preachers and the constable.
The latter arose and said, "Mr. Woodruff, I would like to 
be baptized."
I told him I would like to baptize him. I went down to the 
pool and baptized the seven. We then met together and I 
confirmed thirteen, and broke bread unto the Saints and we all 
rejoiced together.
The constable went to the rector and told him if he wanted 
Mr. Woodruff taken up for preaching the gospel, he must go 
himself and serve the writ, for he had heard him preach the 
only true gospel sermon he had ever listened to in his life.THE WORD OF THE LORD FULFILLED.
traveled forty-eight miles by coach and on foot during the 
day, but after receiving refreshments we sat down together, 
and conversed until two o'clock in the morning.
Mr. [[John Benbow|Benbow]] and his [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]] rejoiced greatly at the glad tidings 
which I brought unto them of the fullness of the everlasting 
gospel, which God had revealed through the mouth of His Prophet, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], in these last days.
1 rejoiced greatly at the news that Mr. Benbow gave me, 
that there was a company of men and women over six hun-
dred in number who had broken off from the Wesleyan 
Methodists, and taken the name of United Brethren. They 
had fort- five preachers among them, and had chapels and many 
houses that were licensed according to the law of the land for 
preaching in.
This body of United Brethren were searching for light and 
truth, but had gone as far as they could, and were continually 
calling upon the Lord to open the way before them, and send 
them light and knowledge that they might know the true way 
to be saved.
When I heard these things I could clearly see why the Lord 
had commanded me, while in the town of [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], to leave 
that place of labor and go to the south, for in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] 
there was a great harvest-field for gathering many Saints into 
the kingdom of God.
I retired to my bed with joy after offering my prayers and 
thanksgiving to God, and slept sweetly until the rising of the 
sun.
I arose on the morning of the 5th, took breakfast, and told 
Mr. Benbow I would like to commence my Master's business, 
by preaching the gospel to the people.
He had a large hall in his mansion which was licensed for 
preaching, and he sent word through the neighborhood that 
an American missionary would preach at his house that 
evening.
As the time drew nigh many of the neighbors came in, and 
I preached my first gospel sermon in the house. I also 
preached on the following evening at the same place, and 
baptized six persons, including Mr. John Benbow and his 
wife, and four preachers of the United Brethren.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
The answer I got was, that I should go to the south, for the 
Lord had a great work for me to perform there, as many souls 
were waiting for the word of the Lord.

ON the 3rd of March, 1840, in fulfillment of the word of 
the Lord to me, I took coach and rode to Wolverhamp-
ton, twenty-six miles, and spent the night there.
On the morning of the 4th I again took coach, and rode 
through [[Dudley, Staffordshire, England|Dudley]], [[Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England|Stourbridge]], [[Stourport, Worcestershire, England|Stourport]] and [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]], and 
then walked a number of miles to Mr. John Benbow's, Hill 
Farm, [[Castle Frome, Herefordshire, England|Castle Frome]], [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]], Herefordshire. This was a 
farming country in the south of [[England|England]], a region where no 
Elder of the Latter-day Saints had visited.
I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthy farmer, cultivating 
three hundred acres of land, occupying a good mansion, and 
having plenty of means. His wife, [[Jane Holmes Benbow|Jane]], had no children.
I presented myself to him as a missionary from America, 
an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
who had been sent to him by the commandment of God as a 
messenger of salvation, to preach the gospel of life unto him 
and his household, and the inhabitants of the land.
Mr. Benbow and his wife received me with glad hearts and 
thanksgiving. It was in the evening when I arrived, havingTHE WORD OF THE LORD TO ME.
it and cast the devil out of it, and the evil spirits had no 
power over the household afterwards.
This was done by the power of God, and not of man. We 
laid hands upon twenty in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] who were sick, and 
they were mostly healed.
On the 21st, I arrived in [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] by coach, and met, for 
the first time, with Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cordon]]. This being my field 
of labor, I stopped and commenced work.
Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] stopped in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|pottery district]] some eight days, 
then went to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]], his field of labor.
I received a letter on the 10th of February, from Elder John 
Taylor, who was at [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]], saying they had commenced 
there and baptized ten persons.
I labored in the Staffordshire Potteries, in Burslem, [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]], 
[[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]], [[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]], and several other villages, from the 22nd of 
January until the 2nd of March, preaching every night in the 
week and two or three times on the Sabbath.
I baptized, confirmed and blessed many, and we had a 
good field open for labor. Many were believing, and it 
appears as though we had a door open to bring many into 
the Church in that part of the vineyard.
March 1st, 1840, was my birthday, when I was thirty-three 
years of age. It being Sunday, I preached twice through the 
day to a large assembly in the City Hall, in the town of Han-
ley, and administered the sacrament unto the Saints.
In the evening I again met with a large assembly of the 
Saints and strangers, and while singing the first hymn the 
Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and the voice of God said 
to me, "This is the last meeting that you will hold with this 
people for many days.â
1 was astonished at this, as I had many appointments out in 
that district.
When I arose to speak to the people, I told them that it 
was the last meeting I should hold with them for many days. 
They were as much astonished as I was.
At the close of the meeting four persons came forward for 
baptism, and we went down into the water and baptized them.
In the morning I went in secret before the Lord, and asked 
Him what His will was concerning me.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
Elder [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] had been called to be one of the 
quorum of the Twelve Apostles, but had not yet received his 
ordination.
On the day following I parted with Elders [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] and Field-
ing, who went to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]], and with Elder Richards, 
who tarried in [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]]. Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] and I went to Man-
chester.
It was the first time I ever visited that city. I here
first met with Elder [[William Clayton|Wm. Clayton]]. As soon as I had an 
introduction to him, he informed me that one of the sisters 
in that place was possessed of the devil, and he asked me to 
go and cast it out of her, thinking that one of the Twelve 
Apostles could do anything in this line he might wish to.
However, I went with him to the house where the woman 
lay, in the hands of three men, in a terrible rage, and trying 
to tear her clothing from her.
I also found quite a number of Saints present, and some 
unbelievers, who had come to see the devil cast out and a 
miracle wrought.
If I had acted upon my own judgment I should not have 
attempted to administer to her with the company present, but 
as I was a stranger there, and Brother Clayton presided over 
the branch, I joined him in administering to the woman. But 
the unbelief of the wicked present was so great, we could not 
cast the devil out of her, and she raged worse than ever.
I then ordered the room to be cleared, and when the com-
pany left the house, except the few attending to her, we laid 
hands upon her, and I commanded the devil to come out of 
her, in the name of Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and she 
was entirely cured and fell asleep.
The next day being the Sabbath, she came before a large 
congregation of people, and bore testimony to what the Lord 
has done for her. We had a large assemblage through the 
day and evening, to whom I preached the gospel.
On Monday morning, the devil, not being satisfied with 
being cast out of the woman, entered into her little child, 
which was but a few months old.
I was called upon to visit the child. I found it in great 
distress, writhing in its mother's arms. We laid hands uponARRIVE IN [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|LIVERPOOL]].

ON January 13th, 1840, after visiting Mr. [[George Cannon|George Cannon]], 
the father of President [[George Quayle Cannon|George Q. Cannon]], and his 
family, we took cars in the evening, and arrived in the 
midst of the Preston branch of the Saints, built up in 1837, 
by Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and Willard 
Richards.
We very soon had a pleasant interview with Elder Willard 
Richards, who had remained in Preston to take care of the 
Church, while the rest had returned home to America.
We spent three days at Preston in visiting the Saints, and 
on the 17th we held a council at Elder Richards' home in 
that place.
After consulting upon the best course for us to pursue, it 
was finally resolved that Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and Joseph 
Fielding go to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]], Elder Woodruff to Staffordshire 
Potteries, [[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley]] to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]], Elder Richards 
wherever the Spirit might direct him, and that [[William Clayton|Wm. Clayton]] 
preside over the branch in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]].
After various principles of the Church had been expounded 
by the Apostles present, the council adjourned.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
commenced speaking to a large congregation, at the same 
hour that my chill had been in the habit of coming on.
I spoke over an hour with great freedom, and my chill left 
me from that hour, and I had no more attacks for many days.
On the Monday following, October 17th, I felt sufficiently 
restored to health to continue my journey. I took leave of 
my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]] and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]], and left for [[New York|New York]], where I arrived 
on the morning of the 8th of November.
I spent two months and seven days after my arrival in New 
York, traveling and preaching in that [[New York City, New York County, New York|city]], [[New Jersey|New Jersey]] and 
[[Long Island, Queens County, New York|Long Island]], a portion of the time with [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley]] and Orson 
Pratt. I had frequent attacks during this time of the chills 
and fever, but I preached almost daily.
On the 13th of December I attended our conference in New 
York City, with Parley P. Pratt, and on this day Elder John 
Taylor arrived in our midst, and it was a happy meeting.
He had passed through a severe siege of sickness after we 
parted, but through the mercy of God had been preserved, 
and was able to continue his journey. He also informed us 
that others of the quorum of the Twelve had suffered a great 
deal of sickness, and that it was with difficulty that they could 
travel.
After spending six days in New York, Elder John Taylor, in 
company with Elder [[Theodore Turley|Theodore Turley]] and myself sailed out of 
[[New York Harbor, New York County, New York|New York Harbor]] for [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]], on board the packet ship 
Oxford on the 19th of December, 1839.
We took steerage passage, which cost fifteen dollars each. 
We had storms and rough weather, but most of the winds 
were favorable for a quick passage.
While on the ship, a Methodist minister got into a dis-
cussion with some Catholics who were in the company, and the 
arguments of the minister ran rather more into abuse than 
sound argument.
Elder Taylor told the Methodist minister that he did not 
think it was becoming in a daughter to find so much fault with 
the mother as they did, for as the Methodists came out of the 
Catholics, Elder Taylor thought the mother had as much 
right to enjoy her religion unmolested as the daughter had. 
That ended the argument.DEATH OF TWO OF MY RELATIVES.

we made the harbor. We landed at midnight, and in doing 
so we ran into a schooner, and stove it in.
From Buffalo I traveled to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]] in a canal boat, and had 
a stroke of the ague daily.
While on my journey, at Albany, I took a stage in the 
night, and rode to my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] home in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], on the
21st of September.
I was glad to meet with my father's family and the other 
members of the small branch of the Church which existed 
here upon this occasion, as I found them all strong in the 
faith of the gospel, and glad to meet with me.
I was still suffering with the ague daily.
On the 27th of September, my grandmother (on my 
mother's side), [[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|Anna Thompson]], died at [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]]. She was 
eighty-four years of age.
It was a singular coincidence that she, with her husband, 
[[Lot Thompson, b. 1752|Lot Thompson]], also [[Mercy Thompson|Mercy Thompson]] and [[Samuel Thompson, b. 1709|Samuel Thompson]], 
all of one family, died when they were eighty-four years of 
age. I was not able to attend my grandmother's funeral.
On the 4th of October, 1839, my uncle, [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart]], died, 
aged forty-three years. I had visited him in his sickness, and 
preached the gospel to him, and he was believing. I had also 
been associated with him from my youth up.
On his death-bed he sent me a request that I would preach 
his funeral sermon.
I was having the chills and fever daily at the time, attended 
with a very severe cough, so much so, that my father thought 
that I would never leave his home alive. But when they 
brought me the request of my dying uncle, and the day came 
for his burial, I told my father to get his horse and buggy 
ready, for I was going to attend the funeral.
He thought I was very reckless in regard to my own life, as 
I had suffered with the chills and fever some fifteen days, and 
to attempt to speak in my weak state, and to begin at the same 
hour that my chill was to come on, seemed to him foolhardy.
My parents were quite alarmed, yet according to my request 
my father got up his team, and I rode with him and my step-
mother five miles, through a cold, chilly wind, and ILEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
The following day, September 2nd, was a painful day to my 
feelings. It was evident that Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] had a settled 
fever upon him, and would not be able to travel.
Father [[John Coltrin|Coltrin]] was resolved to continue his journey, and, 
in conversing with Brother Taylor, he thought it better for 
one sick man to be left than for two, as I was so sick with the 
chills and fever that I was not able to render him any assist-
ance, nor, indeed, to take care of myself. Under these 
circumstances, Brother Taylor advised me to continue my 
journey with Brother Coltrin, and make the best of my way 
to [[New York|New York]].

AFTER committing Elder Taylor into the hands of the Lord, 
though painful to me, I gave him the parting hand, and 
started. I left him in Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana, 
in the hands of a merciful God and a kind and benevolent 
family, who promised to do everything in their power to make 
him comfortable until his recovery.
This they did, though he passed through a severe course of 
the bilious fever, and was sick nigh unto death. Through the 
mercy of God, however, he recovered from his sickness, and 
continued his journey. We next met in the city of New 
York.
I continued my journey with Father [[John Coltrin|Coltrin]], and we reached 
Cleveland on the 18th of September. We there took steamerELDER [[John Taylor, b. 1808|TAYLOR]] STRICKEN.
I had the chills and fever nearly every other day, which 
made riding in a lumber wagon very distressing to me, 
especially when I shook with the ague.
On the 24th of August, we rode to [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]], and spent the night with Dr. [[Charles Burns Modesitt|Modisett]]. I suffered much with the 
chills and fever.
Elder John Taylor up to this time had appeared to enjoy 
excellent health, but the destroyer did not intend to make him 
an exception to the rest of the Apostles. On the 28th of 
August, he fell to the ground as though he had been knocked 
down. He fainted away, but soon revived. On the following 
day, however, the enemy made a powerful attack upon his 
life. He fainted away several times, and it seemed as though 
he would die. We stopped several hours with him at a house 
by the wayside. We then took him into the wagon and drove 
to [[Horace Sunderlin Eldredge|Horace S. Eldredge's]], and spent the remainder of the day 
and night doctoring him.
In the morning Brother Taylor was so far recovered that he 
thought he would be able to ride. So we started on our 
journey on the morning of the 30th, and we traveled forty 
miles, to [[Louisville, Clay County, Illinois|Louisville]], and spent the night with the family of Brother [[James Townsend|James Townsend]].
We felt terribly shaken up, being in such a weak state. 
Brother Townsend was away from home, but we were kindly 
entertained by Sister [[Susan Davis Townsend|Townsend]].
In the morning, Elder Taylor, though very weak, felt dis-
posed to continue his journey. We traveled fourteen miles 
to [[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germantown]]. He was quite sick at night, and the bilious 
fever seemed to settle upon him. I was also very feeble 
myself.
On the day following, September 1st, being Sunday, Brother 
Taylor concluded to remain there for the day, and hold a 
meeting.
It was a German settlement. He wished me to speak, and 
I spoke upon the first principles of the gospel. He followed 
me, and spoke until he was exhausted.
After we returned to the inn where we were stopping, I was 
taken with a chill and fever, and had a very bad night. 
Brother Taylor was also very sick.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL
Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] was about the only man in the quorum that 
was not sick.
Soon a brother came along with a wagon, and took us in. 
As we were driving through the place, we came to Parley P. 
Pratt, who was stripped to the shirt and pants with his head 
and feet bare. He was hewing a log, preparing to build a 
cabin.
"He said: "Brother Woodruff, I have no money, but I 
have an empty purse, which I will give you." He brought 
it to me, and I thanked him for it.
We went a few rods further, and met Brother Heber C. 
Kimball, in the same condition, also hewing a log, towards 
building a cabin.
He said: "As Parley has given you a purse, I have got a 
dollar I will give you to put in it.â
He gave me both a dollar and a blessing.
We drove sixteen miles across a prairie, and spent the night 
with a Brother [[Brother Merrill|Merrill]]. The day following we rode ten miles, 
to a Brother [[Ute Perkins Sr.|Perkins']], and he took us in his wagon to 
[[Macomb, McDonough County, Illinois|Macomb]], and from thence to Brother [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don Carlos Smith's]].
I rode four hours during the day over a very rough road of 
stones and stumps, lying on my back in the bottom of the 
wagon, shaking with the ague, and I suffered much.
We held a meeting in a grove near Don Carlos Smith's, and 
here Elder Taylor baptized [[George Miller|George Miller]], who afterwards 
was ordained a Bishop.
At the meeting the Saints gave us nine dollars, and George 
Miller gave us a horse to help us on our journey.
I rode to [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] with Father [[John Coltrin|Coltrin]], where I had an 
interview with several families of the Fox Island Saints, 
whom I had brought up with me from [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]], in 1838.
I spent several days with them and at [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], where 
Elder Taylor published fifteen hundred copies, in pamphlet 
form, of a brief sketch of the persecutions and sufferings of 
the Latter-day Saints, inflicted by the inhabitants of Mis-
souri.
We sold our horse, and in company with Father Coltrin, 
Brother Taylor and myself left Springfield, and continued 
our journey.START ON A MISSION.

LEAVE MY FAMILYâSTART UPON MY MISSIONâOUR CON-
DITIONâELDER [[John Taylor, b. 1808|TAYLOR]] THE ONLY ONE NOT SICKâ
REPROOF FROM THE [[Joseph Smith Jr.|PROPHET]]âINCIDENTS UPON THE 
JOURNEYâELDER TAYLOR STRICKENâI LEAVE HIM SICK.
EARLY upon the morning of the 8th of August, I arose 
from my bed of sickness, laid my hands upon the head 
of my sick wife, [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phoebe]], and blessed her. I then departed 
from the embrace of my companion, and left her almost with-
out food or the necessaries of life.
She parted from me with the fortitude that becomes a 
Saint, realizing the responsibilities of her companion. I 
quote from my journal:
"Phoebe, farewell! Be of good cheer; remember me in 
your prayers. I leave these pages for your perusal when I 
am gone. I shall see thy face again in the flesh. I go to 
obey the commands of Jesus Christ."
Although feeble, I walked to the banks of the Mississippi 
river. There President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] took me in a canoe 
(having no other conveyance) and paddled me across the river.
When we landed, I lay down on a side of sole leather, by 
the post office, to rest.
Brother Joseph, the Prophet of God, came along and looked 
at me.
"Well, Brother Woodruff," said he, "you have started 
upon your mission."
"Yes," said I, "but I feel and look more like a subject for 
the dissecting room than a missionary.â
Joseph replied: "What did you say that for? Get up, and 
go along; all will be right with you!"
I name these incidents that the reader may know how the 
brethren of the Twelve Apostles started upon their missions 
to [[England|England]], in 1839.
Elder John Taylor was going with me, and we were the first 
two of the quorum of the Twelve who started on their mission.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
"We may ever know by this sign that there is danger of 
our being led to a fall and apostasy when we give way to the 
devil, so as to neglect the first known duty; but whatever you 
do, do not betray your friend."
The foregoing are some of the instructions given to the 
Twelve by the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], before they started upon their 
missions.
Inasmuch as the devil had been in a measure thwarted by 
the Twelve going to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and returning without harm, 
it seemed as though the destroyer was determined to make 
some other attempt upon us to hinder us from performing 
our missions; for it seemed that as soon as any one of the 
Apostles began to prepare for starting, he was smitten with 
chills and fever or sickness of some kind.
Nearly all of the quorum of the Twelve or their families 
began to be sick, so it still required the exercise of a good deal 
of faith and perseverance to start off on a mission.
On the 25th of July, for the first time in my life, I was 
attacked with chills and fever; and this I had every other 
day, and, whenever attacked, I was laid prostrate.
My wife, [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phoebe]], was also soon taken down with the chills 
and fever, as were quite a number of the Twelve.
I passed thirteen days in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] with my family, after I 
was taken sick, before I started on my mission.
The 7th of August was the last day I spent at home in Mon-
trose, and although sick with the chills and fever the most of 
the day, I made what preparations I could to start on the mor-
row on a mission of four thousand miles, to preach the gospel 
to the nations of the earth, and this, too, without purse or 
scrip, with disease resting upon me, and a stroke of fever and 
ague once every two days.
Yet I did this freely, for Christ's sake, trusting in Him for 
the recompense or reward. My prayer was: "May the Lord 
give me grace according to my day and souls for my hire, and 
a safe return to my family and friends, which favor I ask in 
the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.âINSTRUCTIONS TO THE TWELVE.
the Twelve be humble and not be exalted, and beware of pride 
and not seek to excel one another, but act for each other's 
good, and honorably make mention of each other's names in 
prayer before the Lord and before your fellow-men. Do not 
backbite or devour a brother. The Elders of Israel should 
seek to learn by precept and example in this late age of the 
world and not be obliged to learn everything we know by sad 
experience. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] trust the remainder of the Twelve will learn 
wisdom and not follow the example of those who have fallen. 
When the Twelve, or any other witnesses of Jesus Christ, stand 
before the congregations of the earth, and they preach in the 
power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost, and the people 
are astonished and confounded at the doctrine, and say 'That 
man has preached a powerful sermon, then let that man or 
those men take care that they do not ascribe the glory unto 
themselves, but be careful that they are humble, and ascribe 
the glory to God and the Lamb; for it is by the power of 
the Holy Priesthood and the Holy Ghost that they have 
power thus to speak.
"Who art thou, O man, but dust! and from whom dost 
thou receive thy power and blessings, but from God?
"Then let the Twelve Apostles and Elders of Israel observe 
this key, and be wise: Ye are not sent out to be taught, but to 
teach.
"Let every man be sober, be vigilant, and let all his words 
be seasoned with grace, and keep in mind it is a day of warn-
ing, and not of many words.
"Act honestly before God and man; beware of sophistry, 
such as bowing and scraping unto men in whom you have no 
confidence. Be honest, open, and frank in all your intercourse 
with mankind.
"I wish to say to the Twelve and all the Saints, to profit by 
this important key, that in all your trials, troubles, tempta-
tions, afflictions, bonds, imprisonments and deaths, see to it 
that you do not betray Jesus Christ, that you do not betray 
the revelations of God, whether in the Bible, Book of Mor-
mon, or Doctrine and Covenants, or any of the words of God.
"Yea, in all your troubles, see that you do not this thing, lest 
innocent blood be found upon your skirts, and ye go down to hell.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
CHAPTER XX.
PREPARING FOR OUR JOURNEY AND MISSIONâTHE BLES-
SING OF THE PROPHET [[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH]] UPON OUR HEADS, AND 
HIS PROMISES UNTO USâTHE POWER OF THE DEVIL 
MANIFESTED TO HINDER US IN THE PERFORMANCE OF 
OUR JOURNEY.
ON the first of July, 1839, Joseph Smith and his counsel-
ors, [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] 
to Montrose, Lee County, Iowa|Montrose]], to spend the day with the Twelve, and set them 
apart and bless them, before they started upon their missions. 
There were twelve of us who met there, and we all dined in 
my house.
After dinner, we assembled at Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]] 
house for our meeting.
Brother Hyrum Smith opened by prayer; after which the 
Presidency laid their hands upon our heads and gave each of 
us a blessing.
President Rigdon was mouth in blessing me, and also 
blessed Sisters [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]], [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]].
The Prophet Joseph promised us if we would be faithful, 
we should be blessed upon our mission, have many souls as 
seals of our ministry, and return again in peace and safety to 
our families and friends; all of which was fulfilled.
Brother Hyrum advised me to preach the first principles of 
the gospel; he thought that was about as much as this gener-
ation could endure.
Then Joseph arose and preached some precious things of 
the Kingdom of God unto us, in the power of the Holy 
Ghost; some of which I here copy from my journal:
"Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy, and be ready 
to forgive our brethren on the first intimation of their repent-
ance and desire for forgiveness; for our Heavenly Father will 
be equally as merciful unto us. We also ought to be willing 
to repent of and confess our sins, and keep nothing back. LetSENT TO HEAL TWIN CHILDREN.
This case of Brother [[Joseph Bates Noble|Noble's]] was the last one of healing 
upon that day. It was the greatest day for the manifestation 
of the power of God through the gift of healing since the 
organization of the Church.
When we left Brother Noble, the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] went, 
with those who accompanied him from the other side, to the 
banks of the river, to return home.
While waiting for the ferry-boat, a man of the world, 
knowing of the miracles which had been performed, came to 
him and asked him if he would not go and heal two twin 
children of his, about five months old, who were both lying 
sick nigh unto death.
They were some two miles from [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]].
The Prophet said he could not go; but, after pausing some
time, he said he would send someone to heal them; and he 
turned to me and said: "You go with the man and heal his 
children.â
He took a red silk handkerchief out of his pocket and gave 
it to me, and told me to wipe their faces with the handker-
chief when I administered to them, and they should be 
healed. He also said unto me: "As long as you will keep 
that handkerchief, it shall remain a league between you and 
me."
I went with the man, and did as the Prophet commanded 
me, and the children were healed.
I have possession of the handkerchief unto this day.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
and milk, and ate it; then put on his hat and followed us 
into the street, to visit others who were sick.
The unbeliever may ask: âWas there not deception in this?â
If there is any deception in the mind of the unbeliever, 
there was certainly none with [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]], the dying man, 
nor with those who were present with him, for in a few min-
utes more he would have been in the spirit world, had he not 
been rescued. Through the blessing of God, he lived up till 
1880, in which year he died in [[Utah Territory|Utah]], while all who were with 
him on that occasion, with the exception of one, are in the 
spirit world.
Among the number were [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], Sidney 
Rigdon, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], George A. 
Smith, [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]. Wilford Woodruff 
is the only one living who was present at the time, and he 
will soon mingle with those who have gone.
As soon as we left Brother Fordham's house, we went into 
the house of [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Noble]], who was very low and 
dangerously sick.
When we entered the house, Brother Joseph took him by 
the hand, and commanded him, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
to arise and be made whole. He did arise and was immedi-
ately healed.
While this was going on, the wicked mob in the place, led 
by one [[David Wells Kilbourne|Kilburn]], had become alarmed, and followed us into 
Brother Noble's house.
Before they arrived there, Brother Joseph had called upon 
Brother Fordham to offer prayer.
While he was praying, the mob entered, with all the evil 
spirits accompanying them.
As soon as they entered, Brother Fordham, who was pray-
ing, fainted and sank to the floor.
When Joseph saw the mob in the house, he arose and had 
the room cleared of both that class of men and their attend-
ant devils. Then Brother Fordham immediately revived and 
finished his prayer.
This shows what power evil spirits have upon the taberna-
cles of men. The Saints are only saved from the power of 
the devil by the power of God.HEALING THE SICK.
passing by my door, Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] said: "Brother Wood-
ruff, follow me.â These were the only words spoken by any of 
the company from the time they left Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham's]] house 
till we crossed the public square, and entered Brother Ford-
ham's house. Brother Fordham had been dying for an hour, 
and we expected each minute would be his last.
I felt the power of God that was overwhelming His Prophet.
When we entered the house, Brother Joseph walked up to 
Brother Fordham, and took him by the right hand; in his 
left hand he held his hat.
He saw that Brother Fordhamâs eyes were glazed, and that 
he was speechless and unconscious.
After taking hold of his hand, he looked down into the 
dying man's face and said: "Brother Fordham, do you not 
know me?" At first he made no reply; but we could all see 
the effect of the Spirit of God resting upon him.
He again said: "Elijah, do you not know me?"
With a low whisper, Brother Fordham answered, "Yes!"
The Prophet then said, "Have you not faith to be healed?"
The answer, which was a little plainer than before, was: "I 
am afraid it is too late. If you had come sooner, I think it 
might have been.â
He had the appearance of a man waking from sleep. It 
was the sleep of death.
Joseph then said: "Do you believe that Jesus is the Christ?"
"I do, Brother Joseph," was the response.
Then the Prophet of God spoke with a loud voice, as in 
the majesty of the Godhead: "Elijah, I command you, in the 
name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise and be made whole!"
The words of the Prophet were not like the words of a man, 
but like the voice of God. It seemed to me that the house 
shook from its foundation.
Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed like a man raised from 
the dead. A healthy color came to his face, and life was mani-
fested in every act.
His feet were done up in Indian meal poultices. He kicked 
them off his feet, scattered the contents, and then called 
for his clothes and put them on. He asked for a bowl of breadLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
CHAPTER XIX.
A DAY OF GOD'S POWER WITH THE PROPHET [[Joseph Smith Jr.|JOSEPH SMITH]]
âA GREAT NUMBER OF SICK PERSONS HEALEDâTHE MOB
BECOMES ALARMEDâTHEY TRY TO INTERFERE WITH 
THE HEALING OF THE SICKâTHE MOB SENT OUT OF 
THE HOUSEâTWIN CHILDREN HEALED.
WHILE I was living in this cabin in the old barracks, we 
experienced a day of God's power with the Prophet 
Joseph. It was a very sickly time and Joseph had given up 
his home in [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] to the sick, and had a tent pitched in 
his door-yard and was living in that himself. The large num-
ber of Saints who had been driven out of [[Missouri|Missouri]], were 
walking into Commerce; but had no homes to go into, and were 
living in wagons, in tents, and on the ground. Many, there-
fore, were sick through the exposure they were subjected to. 
Brother Joseph had waited on the sick, until he was worn 
out and nearly sick himself.
On the morning of the 22nd of July, 1839, he arose reflect-
ing upon the situation of the Saints of God in their persecu-
tions and afflictions, and he called upon the Lord in prayer, 
and the power of God rested upon him mightily, and as Jesus 
healed all the sick around Him in His day, so Joseph, the 
Prophet of God, healed all around on this occasion. He 
healed all in his house and door-yard, then, in company with 
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] and several of the Twelve, he went through 
among the sick lying on the bank of the river, and he 
commanded them in a loud voice, in the name of Jesus Christ 
to come up and be made whole, and they were all healed. 
When he healed all that were sick on the east side of the 
river, they crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] in a ferry-boat to the 
west side, to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]], where we were. The first house they 
went into was President [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]]. He was sick on 
his bed at the time. The Prophet went into his house and 
healed him, and they all came out together. As they wereSURVIVORS OF [[Haun's Mill, Braymer, Caldwell County, Missouri|HAUN'S MILL]] MASSACRE.
Spirit of the Lord was poured out upon us, and we had a 
glorious day.
On May 6th, I met with the Seventies, and we ordained 
sixty men into the quorums of Elders and Seventies. Brother 
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] met with the Twelve, Bishops and Elders, at Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge's]] house; and there were a number with us who were 
wounded at Haun's Mill. Among them was [[Isaac Laney|Isaac Laney]], 
who had been, in company with about twenty others, at the 
mill, when a large armed mob fired among them with rifles 
and other weapons, and shot down seventeen of the brethren, 
and wounded more. Brother Laney fled from the scene, but 
they poured a shower of lead after him, which pierced his 
body through and through. He showed me eleven bullet 
holes in his body. There were twenty-seven in his shirt, seven 
in his pantaloons, and his coat was literally cut to pieces. 
One ball entered one arm-pit and came out at the other.
Another entered his back and came out at the breast. A 
ball passed through each hip, each leg and each arm. All 
these shots were received while he was running for life, and, 
strange as it may appear, though he had also one of his ribs 
broken, he was able to outrun his enemies, and his life was 
saved. We can only acknowledge this deliverance to be by 
the power and mercy of God.
President [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] was also among the number. He 
also fled, and although the balls flew around him like hail, he 
was not wounded. How mysterious are the ways of the Lord!
Before starting on our missions to [[England|England]], we were under 
the necessity of settling our families. A place called Com-
merce, afterwards named [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]], was selected as the place 
at which our people should settle.
I left [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], in company with Brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] 
and our families on the 15th of May, and arrived in Com-
merce on the 18th. After an interview with Joseph we 
crossed the river at [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]], Iowa. President Brigham 
Young and myself, with our families, occupied one room 
about fourteen feet square. Finally Brother Young obtained 
another room and moved into it by himself. Then Brother 
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and family moved into the same room with 
myself and family.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
and [[Missouri|Missouri]], and returned to [[Illinois|Illinois]]. We had accomplished 
the mission without a dog moving his tongue at us, or any 
man saying, "Why do you do so?"
We crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]] on the steam ferry, entered
[[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] on the 2nd of May, and all had the joy of reaching 
our families once more in peace and safety.
There was an incident connected with our journey that is 
worthy of record. While we were on our way to fulfill the 
revelation, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], the Prophet, and his companions in chains 
had been liberated, through the blessings of God, from their 
enemies and prison, and they passed us. We were not far 
distant from each other, but neither party knew it. They were 
making their way to their families in Illinois, while we were 
traveling to the [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] into the midst of our enemies. So they 
came home to their families and friends before our return.
May the 3rd was a very interesting day to me, as well as to 
others. In company with five others of the quorum of the 
Twelve, I rode four miles out of town to Mr. [[John Cleveland|Cleveland's]], to 
visit Brother Joseph Smith and his family.
Once more I had the happy privilege of taking Brother 
Joseph by the hand. Two years had rolled away since I had 
seen his face. He greeted us with great joy, as did Hyrum 
Smith and [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], all of whom had escaped from their 
imprisonment together. They had been confined in prison six 
months, and had been under sentence of death three times; 
yet their lives were in the hands of God, and He had delivered 
them, and they were now mingling with their wives, children 
and friends, and out of the reach of the mob. Joseph was 
frank, open and familiar as usual, and our rejoicing was great.
No man can understand the joyful sensations created by 
such a meeting, except those who have been in tribulation for 
the gospel's sake.
After spending the day together, we returned to our families 
at night.
On the day following, May 4th, we met in conference at 
Quincy, the Prophet Joseph presiding, which caused great 
joy and rejoicing to all the Saints.
On Sunday, May 5th, Joseph Smith addressed the assembly, 
followed by [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] and the Twelve Apostles. TheORDAINED TO THE APOSTLESHIP.
fulfilled this day should not be, and notwithstanding that ten 
thousand of the Saints had been driven out of the [[Missouri|State]] by 
the edict of the [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|governor]], and though the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] 
and his brother, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]], with other leading men were 
in the hands of our enemies, in chains and in prison, we 
moved on to the temple grounds in the city of [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and 
held a council, and fulfilled the revelation and commandments 
given unto us, and we performed many other things at this 
council.
We excommunicated from the Church thirty-one persons, 
who had apostatized and become its enemies.
The "Mission of the Twelve" was sung, and we then 
repaired to the south-east corner of the temple ground, and, 
with the assistance of Elder [[Alpheus Cutler|Alpheus Cutler]], the master work-
man of the building committee, laid the south-east chief 
corner stone of the temple, according to revelation.
There were present of the Twelve Apostles: Brigham 
Young, [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]] and 
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], who proceeded to ordain Wilford Woodruff and 
[[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]], to the apostleship, and as members of the 
quorum of the Twelve, in the places of those who had fallen, 
as they had been called by revelation.
[[Darwin John Chase|Darwin Chase]] and [[Norman Shearer|Norman Shearer]], who had just been 
liberated from [[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]] prison, were also ordained to the 
office of Seventies. The Twelve then offered up vocal prayer 
in the following order: Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, 
Orson Pratt, John E. Page, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff 
and George A. Smith, after which we sang "Adam-ondi-
Ahman.â
The Twelve then took their leave of, and gave the parting 
hand to, the following Saints, agreeable to revelation: A.
Butler, [[Elias Smith|Elias Smith]], Norman Shearer, [[William Burton|Wm. Burton]], Stephen

issued a proclamation, in which all the Latter-day Saints were 
required to leave that [[Missouri|State]] or be exterminated. [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]] 
had been captured by the militia, who were really only an 
organized mob; the citizens had been compelled to give up 
their arms; all the leading men who could be got hold of had 
been taken prisoners; the rest of the Saintâmen women and 
childrenâhad to flee as best they could out of the State to 
save their lives, leaving all their houses, lands and other prop-
erty which they could not carry with them to be taken by the 
mob. In fact they shot down the cattle and hogs of the 
Saints wherever they could find them, and robbed them of 
nearly everything they could lay their hands upon. Latter-
day Saints were treated with merciless cruelty and had to 
endure the most outrageous abuses. It was with the greatest 
difficulty that many of them got out of the State, especially 
the prominent men; for there were many men of that State at 
that time, who acted as though they thought it no more harm 
to shoot a "Mormon" than a mad dog. From this brief ex-
planation you will be able to understand why some of the 
brethren thought we were not required to go back to Far West 
to start from there upon our mission across the ocean to 
[[Europe|Europe]].
Having determined to carry out the requirement of the 
revelation, on the 18th of April, 1839, I took into my wagon 
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]; and Father [[Alpheus Cutler|Cutler]] took 
into his wagon [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] and [[George Albert Smith|George A. Smith]], and we 
started for Far West.
On the way we met [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]], who was going 
with his family, to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], Illinois. His wagon had turned 
over, and when we met him he was trying to gather up a 
barrel of soft soap with his hands. We helped him get up 
his wagon. He drove down into the valley below, left his 
wagon, and accompanied us on our way.
On the night of the 25th of April, we arrived at Far West, 
and spent the night at the home of [[Morris Phelps|Morris Phelps]], who was
not there, however, himself; he, having been taken prisoner 
by the mob, was still in prison.
On the morning of the 26th of April, 1839, notwithstanding 
the threats of our enemies that the revelation which was to beDETERMINED TO FULFILL THE LORD'S COMMAND.
It will be observed that this differs from nearly all other 
revelations in this respect: a fixed day and a stated place were 
given for the commencement of the mission. When the reve-
lation was given, all was peace and quietude in [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]],
Missouri, the city where most of the Latter-day Saints dwelt; 
but before the time came for its fulfillment, the Saints of God 
had been driven out of the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]] into the State 
of [[Illinois|Illinois]], under the edict of Governor [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]]; and the Mis-
sourians had sworn that if all the other revelations of Joseph 
Smith were fulfilled, that should not be. It stated the day 
and the place where the Twelve Apostles should take leave 
of the Saints, to go on their missions across the great waters, 
and the mobocrats of Missouri had declared that they would 
see that it should not be fulfilled.
It seemed as though the Lord, having a foreknowledge of 
what would take place, had given the revelation in this man-
ner to see whether the Apostles would obey it at the risk of 
their lives.
When the time drew near for the fulfillment of this com-
mandment of the Lord, [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] was the President of 
the Twelve Apostles; [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thos. B. Marsh]], who was the senior Apostle, had fallen. Brother Brigham called together those 
of the Twelve who were then at [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], Illinois, to see what 
their minds would be about going to Far West, to fulfill the 
revelation. The Prophet Joseph and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], 
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] were in 
prison in Missouri, at the time; but Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]], 
the Patriarch, was at Quincy, Illinois. He and others who 
were present did not think it wisdom for us to attempt the 
journey, as our lives would be in great jeopardy. They 
thought the Lord would take the will for the deed. But when 
President Young asked the Twelve what our feelings were 
upon the subject, we all of us, as the voice of one man, said 
the Lord God had spoken, and it was for us to obey. It was 
the Lord's business to take care of His servants, and we 
would fulfill the commandment, or die trying

making this journey, my readers should remember that

obtained nothing from his effects except a few trifling mementos.
I left this place and crossed into [[Illinois|Illinois]] on the 13th of De-
cember, and arrived at [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] on the 19th, and, getting 
information of the severe persecutions of the Saints in Mis-
souri and the unsettled state of the Church at that time, we 
concluded to stop at Rochester and spend the winter.
Thus ended my journey of two months and sixteen days, 
leading the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Island]] Saints to the west, through all the 
perils of a journey of nearly two thousand miles, in the midst 
of sickness and great severity of weather.
I took my family in the spring and removed to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], 
Illinois, where I could mingle with my brethren, and I felt to 
praise God for His protecting care over me and my family in 
all our afflictions.

JOSEPH SMITH, the Prophet, asked the Lord what His 
will was concerning the Twelve, and the Lord answered in 
a revelation, given July 8th, 1838, in which He says: 
"Let them take leave of my Saints in the city Far West, on 
the 26th day of April next, on the building spot of my house, 
saith the Lord. Let my servant [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], and also my 
servant [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]], and also my servant Wilford Woodruff, 
and also my servant [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]], be appointed to fill the 
places of those who have fallen, and be officially notified 
of their appointment."MY [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|WIFE'S]] SPIRIT RETURNS TO HER BODY.
same to depart from her, and the spirit of life to enter her body.
Her spirit returned to her body, and from that hour she was 
made whole; and we all felt to praise the name of God, and to 
trust in Him and to keep His commandments.
While this operation was going on with me (as my wife re-
lated afterwards) her spirit left her body, and she saw 
it lying upon the bed, and the sisters weeping. She looked 
at them and at me, and upon her babe, and, while gazing upon 
this scene, two personages came into the room carrying a coffin 
and told her they had come for her body. One of these mes-
sengers informed her that she could have her choice: she 
might go to rest in the spirit world, or, on one condition she 
could have the privilege of returning to her tabernacle and 
continuing her labors upon the earth. The condition was, if 
she felt that she could stand by her husband, and with him 
pass through all the cares, trials, tribulation and afflictions of 
life which he would be called to pass through for the gospel's 
sake unto the end. When she looked at the situation of her 
husband and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child]] she said: "Yes, I will do it!"
At the moment that decision was made the power of faith 
rested upon me, and when I administered unto her, her spirit 
entered her tabernacle, and she saw the messengers carry the 
coffin out at the door.
On the morning of the 6th of December, the Spirit said to 
me: "Arise, and continue thy journey!" and through the 
mercy of God my wife was enabled to arise and dress herself 
and walked to the wagon, and we went on our way rejoicing.
On the night of the 11th I stopped for the night at an inn, 
the weather being very cold. I there learned of the sudden 
death of my brother, [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel H. Woodruff]], a merchant of 
[[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]], Ind.
I had anticipated a joyful meeting with this brother on the 
following day. Instead of this, I only had the privilege of 
visiting his grave, in company with my wife, and examining a 
little into his business.
I was offered the position of administrator of his affairs, 
but I was leading a company of Saints to Zion, and could not 
stop to attend so his temporal business. Strangers settled hisLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|her]] spirit revived, and I drove a short distance to a tavern, 
and got her into a room and worked over her and her [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|babe]] all 
night, and prayed to the Lord to preserve her life.
In the morning the circumstances were such that I was under 
the necessity of removing my wife from the inn, as there was 
so much noise and confusion at the place that she could not 
endure it. I carried her out to her bed in the wagon and 
drove two miles, when I alighted at a house and carried my 
wife and her bed into it, with a determination to tarry there 
until she either recovered her health or passed away. This 
was on Sunday morning, December 2nd.
After getting my wife and things into the house and wood 
provided to keep up a fire, I employed my time in taking care 
of her. It looked as though she had but a short time to live.
She called me to her bedside in the evening and said she 
felt as though a few moments more would end her existence in 
this life. She manifested great confidence in the cause she 
had embraced, and exhorted me to have confidence in God and 
to keep His commandments.
To all appearances, she was dying. I laid hands upon her 
and prayed for her, and she soon revived and slept some 
during the night.
December 3rd found my wife very low. I spent the day in
taking care of her, and the following day I returned to [[Eaton, Preble County, Ohio|Eaton]] 
to get some things for her. She seemed to be gradually sink-
ing and in the evening her spirit apparently left her body, and 
she was dead.
The sisters gathered around her body, weeping, while I 
stood looking at her in sorrow. The spirit and power of God 
began to rest upon me until, for the first time during her sick-
ness faith filled my soul, although she lay before me as one dead.
I had some oil that was consecrated for my anointing while 
in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. I took it and consecrated it again before the 
Lord for anointing the sick. I then bowed down before the 
Lord and prayed for the life of my companion, and I anointed 
her body with the oil in the name of the Lord. I laid my 
hands upon her, and in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuked 
the power of death and the destroyer, and commanded the BAD ROADS AND COLD WEATHER.
three months in traveling in wagons, through rain, mud, 
snow and frost. It was such a trial as I never before had 
attempted during my experience as a minister of the gospel. 
On our arrival at [[Georgetown, Essex County, Massachusetts|Georgetown]] we were joined by Elder Mil-
ton Holmes. We traveled each day as far as we could go, and 
camped wherever night overtook us.
On the 13th of October, while crossing the Green Moun-
tains, I was attacked with something resembling the cholera. 
I was very sick. I stopped at a house for about two hours, 
but the Elders administered to me, and I revived.
On the 24th I was again taken sick, and my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child]] 
were also stricken down. We also had several others sick in 
the company, through the exposure of the journey.
On the 31st we had our first snow storm, and the horses 
dragged our wagons all day through mud, snow and water.
On the 2nd of November Elder Milton Holmes left us, and 
took steamer for [[Fairport Harbor, Lake County, Ohio|Fairport]]; and two days afterwards a little 
boy of [[Nathaniel Holmes|Nathaniel Holmes']], about six years of age, died, and 
we had to bury him at [[Westfield, Chautauqua County, New York|Westfield]].
The roads finally became so bad and the cold so severe that 
Nathaniel Thomas and [[James Townsend|James Townsend]] concluded to stop for 
the winter. We parted with them on the 21st of November, 
near [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]], Ohio.
On the 23rd of November my wife, Phoebe, was attacked 
with a severe headache, which terminated in brain fever. 
She grew more and more distressed daily as we continued our 
journey. It was a terrible ordeal for a woman to travel in a 
wagon over rough roads, afflicted as she was. At the same 
time our child was also very sick.
The 1st of December was a trying day to my soul. My wife 
continued to fail, and in the afternoon, about 4 o'clock, she 
appeared to be struck with death. I stopped my team, and it 
seemed as though she would breath her last lying in the 
wagon. Two of the sisters sat beside her, to see if they could 
do anything for her in her last moments.
I stood upon the ground, in deep affliction, and meditated. 
I cried unto the Lord, and prayed that she might live and not 
be taken from me. I claimed the promises the Lord had 
made unto me through the prophets and patriarchs, and soonLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
ever, in company with [[Nathaniel Thomas|Nathanial Thomas]], who had sold his 
property and had money, I went to the mainland and pur-
chased ten new wagons, ten sets of harness and twenty horses. 
When I got everything prepared for the company to start, I 
left the affairs with Brother Thomas, and went on ahead of 
the company to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]], to prepare my own family for the 
journey.
The outfit which I purchased for the company cost about 
$2,000.00.
Before leaving Brother Thomas, I counselled him in regard 
to the course to pursue, and charged him not to be later than 
the 1st of September in starting from the mainland.
I arrived at Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]] on the 19th of August, and 
waited with great anxiety for the arrival of the company from 
the islands, but instead of reaching there by the 1st of Sep-
tember they did not arrive till the 3rd of October; and when 
they did arrive the wagon covers were all flying in the breeze. 
It took a good day's work to nail down the covers, paint the 
wagons and get prepared for the journey.

ON the afternoon of the 9th of October, we took leave of 
Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter]] and family, and started upon our journey of 
2,000 miles at this late season of the year, taking my wife
with a suckling babe at her breast with me, to lead a company 
of fifty-three souls from [[Maine|Maine]] to [[Illinois|Illinois]], and to spend nearlyRECEIVE NEWS FROM [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|FAR WEST]].
I arrived in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]] on the 6th, and on the 14th my first 
childâa daughterâwas born, at Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]] house. We 
named her [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]].
On the 30th of July, I left my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] and child at Father Carterâs
and started once more to visit [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]].
While holding meeting with the Saints at North Vinal
Haven on the 9th of August, I received a letter from Thomas 
B. Marsh, who was then President of the Twelve Apostles, 
informing me that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], the Prophet, had received a 
revelation, naming as persons to be chosen to fill the places of 
those who had fallen; [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]], [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]], Wilford 
Woodruff and [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]].
President Marsh added, in his letter, "Know then, 
Brother Woodruff, by this, that you are appointed to fill the 
place of one of the Twelve Apostles, and that it is agreeable 
to the word of the Lord, given very lately, that you should 
come speedily to Far West, and, on the 26th of April next, 
take your leave of the Saints here and depart for other climes 
across the mighty deep.â
The substance of this letter had been revealed to me several 
weeks before, but I had not named it to any person.
The time having now come for me to prepare for leaving the 
islands, I had a desire to take with me all the Saints I could 
get to go to Zion. There had already been a line drawn upon 
the islands between the Saints and those who had rejected the 
gospel, and the enemies were very bitter against me and the 
work of God I had labored to establish. They threatened my 
life, but the Saints were willing to stand by me.
I spent four days with the Saints visiting them, holding 
meetings and encouraging them, while the devil was raging 
upon every hand.
I had baptized and organized into the Church nearly one 
hundred persons while upon the islands, and there seemed a 
prospect of gathering about half of them with me, but the 
devil raged to such an extent that quite a number were terri-
fied.
The inhabitants of the islands had but little acquaintance 
with the management of horses or wagons; in fact, most of 
them knew more about handling a shark than a horse. How-LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
CHAPTER XVI.
TAKING LEAVE OF MY OLD HOMEâRETURN TO [[Maine|MAINE]]âBIRTH 
OF MY FIRST [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|CHILD]]âAPPOINTMENT TO THE APOSTLE-
SHIP AND TO A FOREIGN MISSIONâPREPARATION FOR 
THE JOURNEY TO ZION.
NOW, as my mission to my native land was accomplished, 
which I felt impressed to take while upon the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]], I 
felt it my duty to return here.
Monday, July 2nd, 1838, was the last day and night I spent 
at my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father's]] home while upon this mission. At the setting 
of the sun I took the last walk with my [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] I ever had with 
her while in my native [[Connecticut|State]]. We walked by the canal and 
viewed the river and fields, and conversed upon our future 
destiny.
After evening prayer with the family, my father retired to 
rest, and I spent a season with my [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-mother]] who had 
reared me from my infancy. In conversation we felt sensibly 
the weight of the power of temptation, out of which the Lord 
had delivered us.
I also spent a short time with my sister Eunice, the only 
sister I was ever blessed with in my father's family. I had 
baptized her into the Church and Kingdom of God, and we 
mingled our sympathies, prayers and tears together before the 
throne of grace.
How truly are the bonds of consanguinity and of the blood 
of Christ united in binding the hearts of the Saints of God 
together, and "how blessings brighten as they take their 
flight!"
This being the last night I was to spend beneath my father's 
roof while upon this mission, I felt the weight of it, and my 
prayer was, "O, Lord, protect my father's house, and bring 
him to Zion!" (which prayer was granted.)
On the morning of July 3rd, I took leave of my relatives 
and my native land, and started on my return to Maine.BAPTIZE ALL MY [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|FATHER'S]] FAMILY.
The Lord heard my prayer and answered my petition, and 
when the hour of meeting had come I arose from my bed, and 
could sing and shout for joy to think I had been delivered 
from the power of the evil one.
Filled with the power of God, I stood up in the midst of the 
congregation and preached the gospel of Jesus Christ unto 
the people in great plainness.
At the close of the meeting we assembled on the banks of 
the [[Farmington River, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington river]], "because there was much water there," 
and I led six of my friends into the river and baptized them 
for the remission of their sins.
All of my father's household were included in this number, 
according to the promise of the [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Patriarch]]. They were all 
relatives except [[Dwight Webster|Dwight Webster]], who was a Methodist class-
leader and was boarding with my father's family.
I organized the small number of nine persons, eight of 
whom were my relatives, into a branch of the Church, and 
ordained Dwight Webster to the office of a Priest and 
administer the sacrament unto them.
It was truly a day of joy to my soul. My father, step-
mother and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]] were among the number baptized. I 
afterwards added a number of relatives. I felt that this
day's work alone amply repaid me for all my labor in the 
ministry.
Who can comprehend the joy, the glory, the happiness and 
consolation that an Elder of Israel feels in being an instrument 
in the hands of God of bringing his father, mother, sister, 
brother, or any of the posterity of Adam through the door 
that enters into life and salvation? No man can, unless he has 
experienced these things, and possesses the testimony of 
Jesus Christ and the inspiration of Almighty God.

roamed in my boyhood with my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]], [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|stepmother]], brothers 
and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|half-sister]].
On my arrival at my father's home I had the happy privilege 
of once more taking my parents and sister by the hand, also 
my uncle, [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]], who was among the number I 
had baptized the year before.
After spending an hour in conversation, we sat down around 
our father's table and supped together and were refreshed. 
Then we bowed upon our knees together in the family circle 
and offered up the gratitude of our hearts to God for preserv-
ing our lives and reuniting us.
I spent the next eighteen days in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] and [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]], 
visiting my father's household, my uncles, aunts, cousins, 
neighbors and friends, preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ 
unto them and striving to bring them into the kingdom of God.
On the 1st of July, 1838, one of the most interesting 
events transpired of my whole life in the ministry.
When Father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] gave me my patriarchal bles-
sing, among the many wonderful things of my life, he prom-
ised me that I should bring my father's household into the 
kingdom of God, and I felt that if I ever obtained the bles-
sing, the time had come for me to perform it.
By the help of God, I preached the gospel faithfully to my 
father's household and to all that were with him, as well as to 
my other relatives, and I had appointed a meeting on Sunday, 
the 1st of July at my father's home.
My father was believing my testimony, as were all in his 
household, but upon this occasion the devil was determined 
to hinder the fulfillment of the promise of the patriarch 
unto me.
It seemed as though Lucifer, the son of the morning, had 
gathered together the hosts of hell and exerted his powers 
upon us all. Distress overwhelmed the whole household, and 
all were tempted to reject the work. And it seemed as 
though the same power would devour me. I had to take to 
my bed for an hour before the time of meeting. I there 
prayed unto the Lord with my whole soul for deliverance, for 
I knew the power of the devil was exercised to hinder me 
from accomplishing what God had promised me.ARRIVE IN [[New York|NEW YORK]]âMEET WITH THE SAINTS THERE.
and Evening and Morning Star]] as [[Albert Perry Rockwood|his]] companions, which he 
read daily.
We conversed together for three hours in this solitary 
abode. He informed me of many things which had trans-
pired while he was confined there as a prisoner. Among 
other things, he mentioned that the jail had taken fire a few 
days previous to my visit. He said it looked a little like a 
dark hour. The fire was roaring over his head, while uproar 
and confusion were upon every hand. Fire engines were 
rapidly playing around the building, with water pouring into 
every room. The people were hallooing in the streets. 
Prisoners were begging for mercy's sake to be let out, or they 
would be consumed in the fire. One was struggling in the 
agonies of death, while others were cursing and swearing. 
Brother Rockwood said he felt composed in the midst of it 
until the fire was extinguished.
At eight o'clock the jailor unlocked the prison door to let 
me out, and I gave the parting hand to the prisoner of 
hope.
We had spent a pleasant time together, and he rejoiced at 
my visit; and who would not, to meet with a friend in a lonely 
prison? I left him in good spirits, and wended my way back 
to [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]].
I spent several days in Boston, holding meetings with the 
Saints there, and then walked to [[Providence, Providence County, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island, 
preaching by the way.
I there took steamer and arrived in New York on the 18th 
of May, where I met with Elder [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and his family, 
and [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]] and near one hundred Saints who had 
been baptized in the [[New York City, New York County, New York|city of New York]].
I spent three days in New York visiting the Saints and 
holding meetings. Several new converts were baptized while 
I was there.
Leaving New York, I traveled through [[New Jersey|New Jersey]], and 
returned to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], Connecticut, the residence of my 
[[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]. I arrived at his house on the 12th of June.
It was with peculiar sensations that I walked over my native 
land, where I spent my youth, and cast my eyes over the

ON the 28th of April we left the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|island]] in an open sail-boat 
and made our way to [[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owl's Head]], and then walked 
twenty miles. The following day we walked forty miles and 
suffered some with weary limbs and blistered feet, but we felt 
that it was for the gospel's sake and did not choose to com-
plain. The next day a walk of thirty miles brought us to 
Scarboro, where we spent the night at Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter's]].
On the 8th of May I parted with Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and 
Father Carter and family, and in company with Milton 
Holmes walked thirty-three miles towards [[Portsmouth, Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Portsmouth]], which 
city we reached the following day and spent several hours 
there, visiting the navy yard. We then walked to George-
town, formerly [[New Rowley, Essex County, Massachusetts|New Rowley]], and spent the night with Father 
[[Nathaniel Holmes|Nathaniel Holmes]].
On the 11th of May I visited [[Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Charleston]] and Bunker Hill 
monument, and also spent several hours in the city of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]], 
which then contained a population of one hundred thousand. 
I ascended to the cupola of the court-house, from which I 
had a fine view of the city. I visited several of the Saints in 
the city, and walked over the long bridge to [[Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and 
[[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]].
I visited the jail there in order to have an interview with 
Brother A. P. Rockwood, who had been cast into prison 
on the plea of debt, in order to trouble and distress him, 
because he was a "Mormon." This was the first time we had 
ever met. The jailor permitted me to enter the room where 
he was. It was the first time in my life I had ever entered a 
prison. The jailor turned the key upon us and locked us 
both in.

been a prominent [[Warren Farr Parrish|Elder]] in the Church, and had labored with 
me as a missionary, had apostatized and been cut off from the 
Church. Learning that I was building up branches of the 
Church upon the island, he and other apostates conspired to 
block up my way by writing lies to the people and stirring up 
a spirit of mobocracy upon the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]].
They succeeded in exerting a strong influence with the 
wicked, but I knew they could not hinder the work of God.
On the 6th of April I held a meeting at Brother Ebenezer 
Carver's, and, though the hearts of the wicked were stirred 
up in bitterness against me, the Spirit of God was with me, 
and at the close of the meeting I baptized three persons. 
One of these was Mrs. [[Abigail Waterman Carver|Abigail Carver]], the mother of Eben-
ezer Carver, who was seventy years of age and in poor health. 
She had not so much as visited a neighbor's house for six 
years, but upon this occasion she walked with boldness to the 
sea shore and I baptized her, and she returned rejoicing.
On the 11th of April I had the happy privilege of again 
meeting with Elders [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]], [[James Townsend|James Townsend]] and 
[[Abner Rogers|Abner Rogers]], who had come to the islands to attend confer-
ence with me.
We held our conference on the 13th of April, on North Fox 
Island, and had a representation of the different branches on 
the islands. We also preached and bore our testimony, 
ordained several and baptized one person at the close of the 
meeting.
On the 17th of April Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] left the islands to 
return to her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]] home in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]], Maine, and a few 
days afterwards I called the Saints of the North Island 
together and communed with and instructed them. I also 
informed them that the Spirit of God bore record to me that 
it was our duty to leave the islands for a season and take a 
western mission. They had been faithfully warned and the 
Saints were established in the truth, while the wicked were 
contending against us, and some were disposed to take our 
lives if they had the power.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
The passage of scripture came to his mind that there would 
be no sign given "but the sign of the prophet Jonas," and 
while this thought was in his mind a large fish arose to the 
top of the water, a distance from him in the sea, and suddenly 
sank out of sight. He much desired to see it again, and soon 
it arose to the top of the water, accompanied by another fish 
of about the same size, and one of them swam on the water in 
a straight line towards Mr. [[Ebenezer Carver|Carver]] as he stood upon the shore. 
It came as near to him as the water would permit, and then 
stopped and gazed at him with a penetrating eye, as though 
it had a message for him. It then returned to its mate in 
the ocean and swam out of sight.
Mr. Carver retraced his steps homeward, meditating upon 
the scene and the wonderful condescension of the Lord.
It is proper to remark that this was at a season of the year 
when fish of that size are never known upon those shores or 
seas, and they are never, at any season, known to come ashore 
as in the case mentioned.
Mr. Carver was convinced that it was intended by the Lord 
as a sign to him.
Two days after this event I visited Mr. Carver at his house, 
and found his [[Mary Stinson Carver|wife]] confined to her bed with a fever, and she 
requested me to administer to her. I placed my hands upon 
her head, the power of God rested upon me, and I com-
manded her in the name of Jesus Christ to arise and walk.
She arose and was healed from that instant, and she walked 
down to the sea and I baptized her in the same place where 
the fish visited her husband. I confirmed her there, and she was 
filled with the Holy Ghost and returned to her home rejoicing.
I now called the people together and exhorted them to sell 
their property and prepare to accompany me to the land of 
Zion. I had labored hard for many days for the temporal 
and spiritual welfare of the inhabitants of those islands, and 
the Lord had blessed my labors and given me many souls as 
seals of my ministry, for which I felt to praise Him; and now 
I felt to labor quite as zealously to gather out those who had 
embraced the gospel, and lead them to Zion.
The worst difficulty which the Saints had to contend with in 
that day was from false brethren. [[Warren Farr Parrish|Warren Parrish]], who hadADVENTURE IN THE SURF.
On the afternoon of the 22nd of March, Brother [[Cyrus Starrett|Sterrett]] 
and I, accompanied by our wives, went several hundred yards 
from shore to a sand bar (it being low tide), to dig clams. 
The ground near the shore was much lower than the bar we 
were on, and while we were all busy digging clams and talk-
ing "Mormonism," the dashing of the waves of the incoming 
tide against the shore suddenly made us conscious that we 
had fifty yards of water between us and the shore.
The surf waves also added to our difficulty, and as we had 
no boat, our only alternative was to cross our four arms, thus 
forming a kind of arm-chair for our wives to sit upon, and 
carry them in turn to the shore, wading through two-and-a-
half feet of water.
By the time we got our wives and clams safely landed, the 
truth of the maxim was firmly impressed upon our minds, 
that "Time and tide wait for no man," not even for a preacher 
of the gospel.

COUNSELED TO GATHER WITH THE SAINTSâREMARKABLE MANIFESTATIONâCASE OF HEALINGâEFFORTS OF APOS-
TATESâVISIT FROM ELDERSâA CONFERENCEâCLOSING 
MY LABORS ON THE [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|ISLANDS]] FOR A SEASON.
ON the 28th of March I received a letter from Zion, 
requesting me to counsel the Saints I had baptized to 
sell their property and gather up to Zion.
About this time the Lord was manifesting Himself upon 
the Islands in various ways, by dreams, visions, healings, signs 
and wonders. I will relate one peculiar circumstance of this 
kind that occurred.
Mr. [[Ebenezer Carver|Ebenezer Carver]] had been investigating our doctrines 
for quite a length of time, and, having a great desire to know 
the truth of our religion, he walked to the sea shore, wishing 
that he might have some manifestation in proof of its truth.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
of despair, believing that he had committed the unpardonable 
sin.
However, I told him what the unpardonable sin was, and 
that he had not committed it; but that it was a trick of the 
devil to make him think so, in order to torment him. He then 
acknowledged that he went down to the wharf a few evenings 
before, with the intention of drowning himself, but when he 
looked into the cold, dark water he desisted and returned 
home, and had said nothing previous to anyone about it.
I taught him the principles of the gospel, which proved a 
comfort to him.
We spent the following day in visiting the people of [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], 
and in the evening preached in a brick school-house, provided 
by Mr. [[Thomas B. Teppley|Teppley]], and many wished to hear more from us.
We next visited [[Northport, Waldo County, Maine|Northport]] and [[Frankfort, Waldo County, Maine|Frankfort]], holding meetings 
at both places, and on the 1st of March, 1838, we entered 
[[Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine|Bangor]], which at that time had a population of ten thousand. 
This was my birthday, I being thirty-one years of age.
I visited some of the leading men of Bangor, and they 
granted me the use of the City Hall, where I preached to 
good audiences for two successive evenings. This was the first 
time a Latter-day Saint Elder had preached in that town. 
Many were anxious to learn more about our principles, but 
our visits through all the towns from [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thompaston]] to Bangor 
were necessarily brief, owing to our appointments upon the 
islands. It was like casting our bread upon the waters and 
trusting in God for the result.
On the 5th of March we sailed from [[Penobscot, Penobscot County, Maine|Penobscot]] for the Isle 
of Holt, where I held a meeting on the following evening.
The next day I took passage on the mail boat for the North 
Island, where I again had the privilege of meeting with the 
Saints for prayer and praise before the Lord.
On my arrival I received a package of letters from friends 
abroad. One was from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and gave an account of the 
apostasy and tribulations which the Saints were passing 
through. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the Prophet and others, with their families, 
had gone to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Far West]], and the Saints were following them.
Brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] returned home, and I was again left 
alone in the ministry.A LIGHT WITNESSED IN THE HEAVENS.
house, and I got one of my ears frozen on the way; but not-
withstanding the severity of the weather, we had quite a large 
and attentive audience. We also spent the next two days 
with the people there and held meetings.
On the evening of the 21st of February, as we came out of 
the school-house, a light appeared in the north-eastern hori-
zon, and spread to the west and soon rolled over our heads. 
It had the appearance of fire, blood and smoke, and at times 
resembled contending armies. The heavens were illuminated 
for the space of half an hour. It seemed at times as though 
the veil was about to rend in twain and the elements were con-
tending with each other.
We looked upon it as one of the signs in the heavens pre-
dicted by the prophets of old, as to appear in the last days. 
We were wading through deep snowdrifts most of the time 
while witnessing this remarkable scene.*
The following day we walked fifteen miles through deep 
snow to [[Belfast, Waldo County, Maine|Belfast]], and, after being refused lodging for the night 
by eight families, we were kindly entertained by a Mr. Thomas 
Teppley.
There was an interesting incident connected with our stay at 
his house. After eating our supper, it being late in the even-
ing, Mr. Teppley placed a stand before me with a Bible upon
it, asking me to read a chapter and have prayers with them, 
he being a religious man.
I opened the Bible mechanically, when, the 25th chapter of 
Matthew being the first to catch my eye, I read it, and as I 
closed the book Mr. Teppley turned to his [[Polly Wentworth Tapley|wife]] and said, "Is
not this a strange thing?" Then he explained to us that he 
had just read that chapter and closed the book when we 
rapped at the door, and he felt impressed to say, " Walk in, 
gentlemen."
There is probably no other chapter in the whole book that 
would have the same influence in causing any one to feed a 
person who professed to be a servant of God, and asked for 
bread.
After becoming acquainted with his circumstances I thought 
it providential that we were led to his house, for although he 
was a professor of religion and a Methodist, he was in a state
2*LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
I had ample evidence of the fact that lying spirits had gone 
out into the world, for three persons whom I had baptized 
had been visited by Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglass]], who told them that I 
denied the Bible and could not be depended upon; and they 
yielded to his insinuations until the devil took possession of 
them, and they were in a disaffected condition, and sent for 
me.
When I met them they were in great affliction, but when I 
instructed them in regard to the principles of the gospel, and 
administered to them, they were delivered from the evil influ-
ence and rejoiced.

On the 15th of February I again crossed to the North 
Island, and after remaining there seven days visiting, we 
returned to [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]]. Here I met Brother James Townsend, 
who had just arrived from [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]].
I ordained Brother Townsend to the office of an Elder, and 
we concluded to take a journey to Bangor, and offer the 
gospel to the inhabitants of that city.
We undertook the journey on foot in the dead of winter, 
when the snow was very deep, and the first day broke the road 
for seven miles to [[Searsmont, Waldo County, Maine|Scarsmont]]. The day following, it being 
Sunday, we held two meetings, preached the gospel to the 
people, and were kindly entertained.
On the evening of the next day we wallowed through snow-
drifts for a mile, to meet an appointment to preach in a school-ATTEMPTS MADE TO DISTURB MY MEETINGS.
society of Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]], my companion. I had been declar-
ing the word of the Lord through the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]] many days, the 
Spirit of God was working among the people, prejudice was 
giving way, and the power of God was manifest by signs fol-
lowing those who believed.
I spent this New Year's Day visiting the Saints and their 
neighbors, and met a congregation at Captain [[Charles Brown|Chas. Brownâs]], 
where I spoke to them for a while, and at the close of my 
remarks led three persons down into the sea and baptized 
them. Two of these were sea captains, namely, Charles 
Brown, and [[Jesse Coombs|Jesse Coombs]], and the third was the [[Mrs. Jesse Coombs|wife]] of Cap-
tain Coombs. After confirming them we spent the evening in 
preaching, singing and praying.
I held meetings almost daily with the Saints up to the 13th, 
when I crossed to the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]]. Here I found that the 
seed I had sown was bringing forth fruit. Six persons were 
ready for baptism.
But my mission upon these islands was not an exception to 
the general rule: success did not come without many obstacles 
presenting themselves. Those who rejected the word were 
frequently inspired by the evil one to make an attempt at per-
secution.
Some of those who felt to oppose me went down to the har-
bor and got a swivel and small arms, and planted them close 
by the school-house, near the sea shore, and while I was 
speaking they commenced firing their cannon and guns. I 
continued speaking in great plainness, but my voice was 
mingled with the report of musketry.
I told the people my garments were clear of the blood of 
the inhabitants of that island, and asked if any wished to 
embrace the gospel. Two persons came forward and wished 
to be baptized, and I baptized them.
On the following day when I went down to the seaside to 
baptize a man, the rabble commenced firing guns again, as on 
the previous night. I afterwards learned that notices were 
posted up, warning me to leave the town, but I thought it 
was better to obey God than man, and, therefore, did not go.
The next day I baptized three persons, and two days subse-
quently a couple of others.LEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
called the [[Isle of Holt, Knox County, Maine|Isle of Holt]]. We arrived at noon, and I preached 
to the people at night in their school-house, and had an 
attentive audience. I spent the night with [[John Turner|John Turner]], 
Esq., who purchased a copy of the Book of Mormon.
On the following day we returned to [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Islands]], and as 
St. Paul once had to row hard to make the land in a storm, 
we had to row hard to make it in a calm.
After preaching on the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]] again and baptizing 
two persons at the close of the meeting, I returned again to 
the [[Maine|mainland]] in company with Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] and others, 
where I spent fifteen days, during which time I visited among 
the people, held twelve meetings and baptized several persons.
On the 13th of December I returned again to the North 
Island, where I held several meetings, and then crossed over 
to the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]].
On the 20th of December I spent an hour with Mr. Isaac 
Crockett in clearing away large blocks of ice from the water 
in a cove, in order to baptize him, which I did when the tide 
came in. I also baptized two more in the same place on the 
26th, and again two others on the 27th.
On the 28th I held a meeting at a school-house, when 
William [[William Douglass|Douglass]], the Methodist minister, came and wanted 
me to work a miracle, that he might believe, and otherwise 
railed against me.
I told him what class of men asked for signs, and that he 
was a wicked and adulterous man, and predicted that the curse 
of God would rest upon him, and that his wickedness would 
be made manifest in the eyes of the people. (While visiting 
these islands several years afterwards I learned that the pre-
diction had really been fulfilled, and that he was serving out a 
fourteen years' term of imprisonment for a beastly crime).
Mrs. Woodruff crossed the thoroughfare in a boat and 
walked ten miles, the length of the island, to meet me, on the 
last day of the year. I held a meeting the same day in the 
school-house, and at the close of the meeting baptized two 
persons in the sea, at full tide, before a large assembly.
January 1st, 1838, found me standing upon one of the 
islands of the sea, a minister of the gospel of life offer salva-
tion unto the people, laboring alone, though blessed with the PART WITH BROTHER [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|HALE]], MY COMPANION.
We walked from [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] to [[Bath, Sagadahoc County, Maine|Bath]], a distance of forty-six 
miles, in one day, and at the latter place attended a Baptist 
convention. I also preached there to a large congregation in the 
evening, and the people gave good attention and wished 
to learn more about our doctrines.
On the following day we walked thirty-six miles to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]], 
and the next day to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]]. Here I again met with my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] 
and her [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father's]] family.
The time had come for me to give the parting hand to 
Brother Jonathan H. Hale. We had traveled during the sea-
son over two thousand miles together, with our hearts and 
spirits well united.
He felt it his duty to return to his family at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], but 
duty called me to return to my field of labor upon the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|islands]].
On the 9th of October I accompanied Brother Hale one 
mile upon his journey. We retired to a grove and knelt down 
and prayed together, and had a good time, and, after com-
mending each other to God, we parted, he to return to 
Kirtland and I to Fox Islands.
I spent fourteen days visiting the Saints and friends, and 
holding meetings among them, and on the 28th of October I 
took leave of Father Carter and family, and in company with 
my wife rode to Portland, and spent the night with my broth-
er-in-law, [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra Carter]].
A severe storm arose, so we could not go to sea until No-
vember 1st, when we took steamer to [[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owl's Head]], carriage to 
Thomaston and sloop to Fox Islands.
My second visit to these islands was made under very differ-
ent circumstances to the first. On my first visit I was an 
entire stranger to the people, and they were strangers to the 
gospel, but upon my second I met many Saints who had 
received the gospel, and who hailed me, and my companion 
also, with glad hearts.
On Sunday, the 5th of November, I met with a large 
assembly of Saints and friends, and again commenced baptiz-
ing such as would receive my testimony.
After visiting the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]] and holding meetings with 
the Saints there, and baptizing two after meeting, I embarked 
on board a sloop, with Captain [[Benjamin Coombs|Coombs]], for another islandLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL.
search out the blood of Ephraim, the honest and meek of the 
earth, and gather them from those islands, rocks, holes and 
caves of the earth unto Zion.
We prayed, and rejoiced together. The Spirit of God 
rested upon us; we spoke of Christ and the ancient prophets 
and apostles in [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]; of Nephi, Alma, Mormon and 
Moroni in America; [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver]] and the apostles 
in our own day, and we rejoiced that we were upon the islands 
of the sea searching out the blood of Israel.
While being filled with these meditations and the Spirit of 
God, we fell upon our knees and gave thanks to the God of 
heaven, and felt to pray for all Israel.
After spending most of the day in praise and thanksgiving, 
we descended to the settlement and held a meeting with the 
people.
On the 6th of September we called upon Captain Benjamin 
Coombs, and visited his flakes, where he had one thousand 
quintals of codfish drying for the market. They had mostly 
been caught in the region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. While we were 
passing [[Carvey's Wharf, Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Carvey's Wharf]] our attention was called to a large 
school of mackerel playing by the side of the wharf. Several 
men were pitching them out with hooks. We also flung in a 
hook and caught all we wanted, then went on our way.

WE continued to labor, preaching and baptizing, and 
organized a branch of the Church upon each island, 
and, finally, on the 2nd of October, we parted from the Saints 
on the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]] to return to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]] for a short time.GREAT EXCITEMENT UPON BOTH [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|ISLANDS]].
The excitement became great upon both Fox Islands islands, and on 
Sunday, the 17th of September, I met a large assembly from 
both Islands, and took the same subject that Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglass]] 
had dwelt upon in his remarks against the Book of Mormon 
and our principles.
I spoke two-and-a-half hours, and answered every objection 
against the Book of Mormon, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] or our prin-
ciples.
I had good attention, and the people seemed satisfied. At 
the close of the meeting Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] administered the ordin-
ance of baptism.
Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], in order to save his cause, went to the main-
land and brought over several ministers with him and held a 
protracted meeting. They hoped by this to stop the work of 
God, but all to no avail, for the whole people would attend 
our meeting and receive the word of God, and we continued 
to baptize.
We visited the dwellings of most of the inhabitants during 
our sojourn there.
Upon one occasion, while standing upon Mr. [[Ebenezer Carver|Carver's]] farm 
on the east end of the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]], we counted fifty-five 
islands in that region, the majority of which were not inhabit-
ed. We also saw twenty ships under sail at the same time.
We had no lack for food while upon the island, for if we did 
not wish to trouble our friends for a dinner, we only had to 
borrow a spade or a hoe and a kettle and go to the beach and 
dig a peck of clams. These, when boiled, would make a 
delicious meal, which we often availed ourselves of.
One day, Elder Hale and I ascended to the top of a high 
granite rock upon the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]], for prayer and supplic-
ation. We sat down under the shade of a pine tree which 
grew out of a fissure in the rock, and Elder Hale read the
16th chapter of Jeremiah, where mention is made of the 
hunters and fishers that God would send in the last days to 
gather Israel.
Of a truth here we were upon an Island of the sea, standing 
upon a rock where we could survey the gallant ships and also 
the islands, which were as full of rocks, ledges and caves as 
any part of the earth. And what had brought us here? ToLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL
tember, and these were the first baptisms performed by proper 
authority upon any of the islands of the sea (to my know-
ledge) in this dispensation.
Before we left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] some of the leading apostates there 
had tried to discourage Brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] about going upon his 
mission, telling him he would never baptize any one, and he 
had better remain at home. When Captain [[Justus Ames|Eames]] offered 
himself for baptism, I told Brother Hale to go and baptize 
him, and prove those men false prophets, and he did so.
On the following Sabbath I baptized his brother, Ebenezer 
Eames, another sea captain, and a young lady.
Mr. [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], the Baptist minister, now commenced a war 
against us, and sent to the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]] for a Mr. [[William Douglass|Douglass]], a 
Methodist minister (with whom he had been at variance for 
years) to come over and help him put down "Mormonism."
Mr. Douglass came over, and they got as many people together 
as they could and held a conference. He railed against 
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], the prophet, and the Book of Mormon, and, taking 
that book in his hand, with out-stretched arm, declared that 
he feared none of the judgments of God that would come upon 
him for rejecting it as the word of God. (I never heard what 
his sentiments upon this subject were at the end of his term of 
fourteen years' imprisonment in the [[Thomaston, Knox County, Maine|Thomaston]] Penitentiary, 
for an outrage upon his daughter, the judgment of which 
was given upon the testimony of his wife and daughter.)
I was present and heard Mr. Douglass' speech upon this 
occasion and took minutes of the same. When he closed I 
arose and informed the people that I would meet with them 
next Sunday in the meeting-house, and answer Mr. Douglass, 
and wished him as well as the people to be present.
I informed the people that Mr. Douglass had made many 
false statements against Joseph Smith and the Latter-day 
Saints, with whom he had no acquaintance, and he had mis-
quoted much scripture, all of which I could correct.
We continued to baptize the people on the [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]] 
until we had baptized every person who owned an interest in the 
Baptist meeting-house. I then followed Mr. Douglass home 
to the South Island and preached the gospel to and baptized 
nearly all the members of his church.BEGIN TO BAPTIZE THE PEOPLE.
I had much liberty in speaking, and informed the people 
that the Lord had raised up a prophet and organized His 
Church as in the days of Christ and the ancient apostles, with 
prophets, apostles and the gifts as anciently, and that He had 
brought forth the Book of Mormon.
At the close of my remarks Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] bore testimony.
I gave liberty for anyone to speak that might wish to. As 
no one responded, I announced that we would hold meetings 
the next four evenings in the school-houses, beginning at No. 1.

DURING the first thirteen days of our sojourn upon the 
island we preached seventeen discourses, being invited by 
the people to tarry with them. I left a copy of the Doctrine 
and Covenants with Mr. Newton for his perusal.
He read it, and the Spirit of God bore testimony to him of 
its truth. He pondered over it for days, and he walked his 
room until midnight trying to decide whether to receive or reject it.
He and his family attended about a dozen of my first meet-
ings, and then he made up his mind, contrary to the dictation 
of the Spirit of God to him, to reject the testimony, and 
come out against me. However, we commenced baptizing his flock.
The first two we baptized were a sea captain, by the name 
of [[Justus Ames|Justin Eames]], and his [[Betsey Hudson Ames|wife]]. Brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan H. Hale]]

He sent for us to come to the pulpit, so we walked through 
the congregation with our valises under our arms, and took 
a seat by the side of the minister, who was about to speak as 
we came to the door.
He arose and delivered his discourse to the people, occupy-
ing about half an hour. When he closed he asked me what 
was my wish.
I told him we wished to speak to the people at any hour 
that would suit his or their convenience; so he gave notice 
that there were two strangers present who would speak to the 
people at five o'clock that evening.
We were quite a source of wonderment to the people, as they 
had no idea who we were.
Mr. Newton asked us home to tea with him, and we gladly 
accepted the invitation. When we arrived at his house I 
opened my valise and took out the Bible, Book of Mormon 
and Doctrine and Covenants, laid them upon the table, and 
took my seat.
Mr. Newton took up the books and looked at them, but 
said nothing. I then asked him if there were any school-
houses upon the island, and if so, whether they were free to 
preach in.
He answered that there were four, numbered respectively 
from one to four, and that they were free.
Mr. Newton and family accompanied us to the meeting-
house, where we met a large congregation, none of whom 
knew who we were or anything about our profession, except 
the minister.
Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] and I went into the stand, and I arose with 
peculiar feelings, and addressed the congregation for one hour,
taking for my text Galatians i. 89.
This was the first time that I or any other Elder of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had (to my 
knowledge) attempted to preach the fullness of the gospel and 
the Book of Mormon to the inhabitants of any island of the sea.MY ARRIVAL AT [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|VINAL HAVEN]].
them for the market. They supply the market with great 
quantities of cod, mackerel and boxed herring.
Upon this [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|island]] there were two stores, three tide saw mills, 
six school houses and a small branch of the Methodist church, 
presided over by a priest.
What timber there is upon this island, such as pine, fir, 
spruce, hemlock and birch, and the whortleberries, rasp-
berries and gooseberries, mostly grow out of the 
cracks of the rocks.
Great quantities of fish, and in almost endless variety, 
inhabit the coves and harbors around the islands. The whale, 
blackfish, shark, ground shark, pilot-fish, horse mackerel, 
sturgeon, salmon, halibut, cod, pollock, tom cod, hake, had-
dock, mackerel, shad bass, alewife, herring, pohagen, 
dolphin, whiting, frost-fish, flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, 
skid, cusk, blueback, scallop, dogfish, muttonfish, lumpfish, 
squid, five-fingers, monkfish, horsefish, sunfish, swordfish, 
thrasher, cat, scuppog, tootog, eye fish, cunner, ling, also the 
eel, lobster, clam, muscle, periwinkle, porpoise, seal, etc., are 
found there.
Thus I have given a brief description of Vinal Haven. It 
was quite dark when we landed there, without a farthing in 
money. We made our way over the rocks and through the 
cedars the best way we could, until we found a house, when 
we rapped at the door, A woman put her head out of the 
window and asked who was there and what was wanted.
I told her we were two strangers, and wanted a bed to lie 
down upon until morning.
She let us in and gave us a bed, and we slept until quite 
late, it being Sunday morning. When we came out and took 
breakfast it was nearly noon. I asked her what she charged 
for our entertainment, and she replied that we were welcome.
I then asked her if there was any religion or minister or 
church on the island.
She informed me there was a Baptist minister, by the name 
of [[Gideon J. Newton|Newton]], who had a congregation and a meeting-house about 
five miles from there.
We thanked her for her kindness, walked to the meeting-
house and stepped inside the doorway. We stood there untilLEAVES FROM MY JOURNAL
CHAPTER VI.
DESCRIPTION OF [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|VINAL HAVEN]]âPOPULATION AND PURSUIT 
OF THE PEOPLEâGREAT VARIETY OF FISHâTHE IN-
TRODUCTION OF THE GOSPEL.
THE town of Vinal Haven includes both [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North]] and South 
Fox Islands, in lat. 44Â° north, and long. 69Â° 10' east. 
The population numbered, at the time of my visit, about 
1,800.  The inhabitants were intelligent and industrious, and 
hospitable to strangers. They got most of their wealth and 
living by fishing. The town fitted out over one hundred 
licensed sailing vessels, besides smaller craft.
North Fox Island is nine miles long by two miles in width 
and had a population of 800. They had a post office, one 
store, a Baptist church and meeting-house, four school-houses
and a tide grist mill.
The land was rather poor, yet there were some good farms. 
The products where wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and grass. 
The principal timber was fir, spruce, hemlock and birch. 
Raspberries and gooseberries grew in great abundance, and 
some up-land cranberries were raised. The principal stock of 
the island were sheep.
South Fox Island comes as near being without any definite 
form as any spot on earth I ever saw. It would be difficult 
for any person to describe it. It is about ten miles in length 
by five in width, and is one universal mass of rocks, formed 
into shelves, hills, and valleys, and cut up into necks and points 
to make room for the coves and harbors that run through and 
through the island.
The population was 1,000. The inhabitants got their living 
entirely by fishing. There is no chance for farming upon the 
island, and but a few garden patches, which are cultivated at 
great expense. Some few sheep are raised there.
Many of the inhabitants fish in the region of [[Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], 
and bring their fish home and cure them on flakes and prepareVISIT MY [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|WIFE'S]] FOLKSâGO FISHING IN THE SEA.
hold another meeting; but I felt anxious to continue my 
journey, and on the 20th of July I parted with my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]], 
[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|step-mother]] and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister]], and took stage for [[Hartford, Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford]] with my 
wife.
On my arrival at Hartford, not having money to pay the 
fare of both of us, I paid my wife's fare to [[New Rowley, Essex County, Massachusetts|Rowley]], Mass., 
where there was a branch of the Church, presided over by 
Brother [[Nathaniel Holmes|Nathaniel Holmes]], father of [[Jonathan Harriman Holmes|Jonathan]] and Milton 
Holmes, and I journeyed on foot.
The first day I walked fifty-two miles, the second day forty-
eight, and the third day thirty-six miles, and arrived at 
Rowley at two o'clock, making 136 miles in a little over two-
and-a-half days.
I spent eight days at New Rowley, holding meetings and 
visiting the Saints, including the Holmes family, and left 
there on the 1st of August.
On the 8th of August, in company with my wife and Elder 
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]], I visited my wife's father, [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Ezra Carter]], and his family 
in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarboro]], Maine, it being the first time I had ever seen any 
of her relatives. We were very kindly received. My wife 
had been absent from her father's home about one year.
I spent eight days with Father Carter and household, and 
one day I went out to sea with [[Joseph Fabyan Carter|Fabian]] and [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra Carter]], my 
brothers-in-law, in a boat, to fish with hooks. We caught 
250 cod, haddock and hake, and we saw four whales, two at a 
time, it being the first time in my life I had ever seen the 
kind of a fish which is said to have swallowed Jonah.
On the 18th of August, 1837, I parted with my wife and her 
father's household, leaving her with them, and, in company 
with Jonathan H. Hale, started upon the mission that I had 
in view when I left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]].
We walked ten miles to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]], and took passage on the 
steamboat Bangor, which carried us to [[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owl's Head]], where we 
went on board of a sloop which landed us on [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Fox Island]] 
at 2 o'clock, a. m., on the 20th.
