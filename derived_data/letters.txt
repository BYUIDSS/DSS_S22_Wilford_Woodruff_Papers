NB My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Companion]], though I have said much in this letter & 
massed together many Broaken sentences upon a great variety of 
subjects great & small temporal & spiritual, yet I have said but little 
concerning the presient state of affairs & prospect &c But when 
I write again I may have room to speak of some things that I 
omit in this But as to the progress of the work we have nothing but 
good news from this country Brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] has given you 
some information upon the progress of the work in what he has writt-
en & I will further add & our present mission has been of much impo-
rtance, in advancing the cause & through the mercy of God we have
been enabled to lay the foundation of a mighty work throughout 
Europe. We have not ownly esstablished churches in all of the largest 
cities i& towns in [[England|England]], [[Wales|Wales]], [[Scotland|Scotland]] & [[Ireland|Irieland]], But Elders
are already in [[South Australia, Australia|South Australia]] (16,000 miles) & the [[East Indies|East Indies]]
& [[Germany|Germany]] & their never was a day when it was progressing 
with the same rapidity as at the present time. There will be 
a great & important work here in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] It has been hard starting 
the work here because we had not power to get at the minds of 
the people as soon as in other places we laboured harder to get the 
first 20 Baptized in London than we should now to Baptize 100 for 
several of the London papers are printing against us which brings
our cause into note & we are begining to have crouded congregations
& that is what we want for if we can get people to hear they will 
believe & recieve it if they are honest & willing to receive the truth. I 
have had the fullest meetings to day I have ever had in London (17th)
8 were added since last sabbath, & 5 offered for Baptism at the 
close of the meeting to, night, we are about to hire a larger chapel
London is a very important place & will be the cenetre point 
of the saints for all Europe, & we feel anxious to leave a good 
standard here when we return home, I shall contine my labours 
in London untill March except I may be absent a few days to attend
a conference in Scotland & Ireland, we shall have a conference 
in London before we leave for [[New York|New York]] which will be [e]arly in 
the spring. My Dear friend be of good cheer let your heart be comfo-
rted, we have been seperated long it is true, but it has been for Christ
sake, we shall not loose our reward, by our sacrafize many souls
have been comforted, & I trust will be saved in the kingdom of God
I feel that the time is near when we shall great each other once more
give me your prayers. you & [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] constantly have mine, could 
my heart prayers & pen speak they would tell you they had not forgott
you on any occasion although you may not have herd their voice since
the 8th of Last July. Good night Phebe, may God bless you & the lad & prepare
us to meet with all the saints in a celestial glory with all our kindred.

18th Good morning Phebe I thought I would scribble a few more 
lines & maill my letter. I dont know as you will be able to make out 
all my scribling, but what you cannot read I will help you when I come 
home. I shall look for a letter in answer to this I hope it will safely 
fall into your hands. I am glad you left word for the things & letters
which I sent to be left with Sister [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimball]]. The American Brethren are

he first came to England in the capital of Scotland, [[Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland|Edinburgh]] & has baptized 
there 120 saints & the work now Prosperous, he like myself is enjoying the 
best of health. [[John Taylor, b. 1808|J. Taylor]] has mostly laboured from the begining in â
[[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] where he now is & well. has baptized 120 in Liverpool & 20 
in the [[Isle of Man|Isle of Man]]. Elder [[Brigham Young|Young]] is there also Binding the Book of Mormon

Sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Sarah Foss]], I wish you in connexion with the rest of the friends an agreeable 
& happy visit with [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] as she is thro[u]gh the kind providence of God permitted 
to spend the winter with you, I trust while together you will be an assistance 
to each other in the spiritual things of the kingdom I trust you will remem-
ber me before the Lord, that I may once more return in safety. truly we have
been called to make great sacrafizes for the kingdom of God & Christ sake, & this 
has been the case with the children of God in evry age of the world, & while the 
gentile nations of the present day are using evry exertion to secure unto themselves 
earthly Honors, wealth, greatness, ease, & momentary pleasure. My object 
is to do the will of God, to act for the salvation of the children of men, & labour 
to secure for myself, my wife & children an eternal inheritance, everlasting 
joy, & an unfading crown, in the celestial glory & mansion of my fathers 
kingdom, & while I know for myself & not another that the cause in which 
i am ingaged is of God & not of man, I cheerfully & freely leave it for the 
first Resurrection, the judgment of the great day, & the eternal world to 
deside who is wise in these things. May God Bless us all & enable us to over-
come & see that no man take our crown for Christs sake, from your Brother

[upside-down text][[Ellen Balfour Redman|[Ellen Balfour Redman] ]] My dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Sister in the Lord]]
Your companion, dear Brother Woodruff has been so kindly indulgent as to 
permit me the privelege of adding a few lines to his letter -- which I esteem a great favour. I understand, My
dear Sister that you propose passing the intervening time of your Husband's absence, with your family -- 
it is very natural that your heart should turn to your parental home in your desolate Situation â but let
me ^charge you^ in the language of sincere Sisterly affection to remember that you belong to the Covenant people of the 
Lord. Remember the trials you have already endured for Righteousness' sake -- and how great will be your 
reward in Heaven. Now beloved Sister that you are for a time removed from the body of the Church, it behooves you 
to be doubly watchful and prayerful that so you may not fall into a lukewarm state âÂ let your light shine â you know 
not the good effect it may have under the influence of the Divine Spirit upon the Souls of those among whom you may 
be thrown nor how many it may be the means of adding to the Kingdom -- of our great Redeemer hold fast then 
that to which you have attained that no man take your crown. The most fervent prayers of my Soul shall daily 
be offered up to the throne of Grace for you and [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|your Babe]]. I will pray the Eternal Father in the name of his 
Son that he pour upon you every needful Blessing temporal or spiritual â that he support and uphold you by 
his Grace and grant you to live day by day, by faith in the Son of God that he supply by his presence the loss of
your Husband's Society â comfort and cheer your drooping Spirits until My dear Brother shall return to make 
glad your heart â accept my best love yourself â and a sweet kiss for your Babe â from your truly affectionate
Sister in the Lord â

[[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]]. I Baptized the whole household 10 in number. He was a large farmer cultivated 600 acres of Land, he sold all out. He let 
Us have $1,250 dollars to Print the Hymn Books & 5000 copies of the Book of Mormon. He also advanced $2,500 dollars to help the 
company of poor Saints to Nauvvo [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Ill that went with him was led by Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] 200 in number He gave me $75 dollars
to bear my expenses in opening the work in the city of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] in our first mission here. I sent this letter by sister Benbow as an introd-
uction or acquaintance with you, which accquaintance she much desired, their house was always my home while I was in that country they 
were worthy people. I Baptized more than a hundred in one pool near their house. He was own brother to [[William Benbow|Wm Benbow]]. On the 6th Day of Augâ
I sealed up a package of 42 Letters, & All my Journals from [[Montrose, Angus, Scotland|Montrose]] to [[England|England]], & the 1 & 3 No's of the [[Millennial Star|Star]], & sent to Mrs Woodruff 
by the hand of Elder Turley these were all my corresponding letters both from Europe & America, I sent them to you thinking they would 
entertain you in a lonely moment or season. Aug 8th one year ago this day, I took the last parting look, with my Dear Phebe to go on a mission 
to fulfill the commandments of God. I wrote A Letter this day to Col [[Lyman Wight|L. Wight]]. Aug 10. I wrote 8 Letters this day, 2 to Phebe one to Ephraim-
Luce, one to [[Nathaniel Thomas|N. Thomas]] one to [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Margarett Smoot]], one to Wm Benbow These I enclosed in one package directed to Phebe W Woodruff, the other 
2 were to Eunice Woodruff, & [[Brigham Young|B Young]] one of these letters directed to Phebe contained a Â£0.10 a half sovreign this whole package I put into 
the hand of Elder Turley myself. 11th I parted with Elder Turley. 12th I herd of the Death of Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] & of certain signs on 
the [[Mississippi River, United States|Miss. River]] Aug 18th for the first time I entered the city of LONDON the Metropolis of England Pop 1,600,000 with Elders [[Heber Chase Kimball|H C Kimball]] & 
[[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]]. Mr's [[Mary Ann Kimberley Allgood|Algood]] sister to Elder Turley [[Frances Amelia Kimberley Turley|wife]] kindly received Us & I wrote A Letter to Phebe.
19th I wrote a letter to Phebe & inclosed 
a sovreign Â£1 & inclosed both in the Letter which I wrote yesterday & forwarded them by mail to Elder Turley to take to Phebe & they reached
in safty. On the 21st I stood on the top of [[The Monument, London, Middlesex, England|the Monument]] built in the memory of the dreadful fire of London in 1666, the highest modern pillar in 
the world. J^A^ul^g^y 22nd I received a Letter from Phebe Dated July 2nd which I was truly much rejoiced to receive, & I wrote Phebe 2 letters in return 
one yesterday 21st one to day 22nd I enclosed both in one & Also Â£0.10 half a sovreign for Phebe to buy anything with it she pleased for [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]]
& little [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]], this I sent to T. Turley to convey to Phebe which he obtained, this made Â£7 seven sovreigns which I sent you by Elder Turley 
you informed me in your letter of July 2nd you would like some clothing & a cape to we^a^re on the neck. I immediately sent to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]]
& got Elder Young to go to the store & Purchased another good winter dress for a large elegant worked cape, a nis^c^e shawl shawl
several yards of flannel, the best pair of linen draperry sheets he could find, & several more caps with some other articles all of which 
wer carefully done up & sent to Phebe by Elder Turley & in addition to these a bundle of Presents from a sister [[Eliza Bromley Rushton|Eliza Bromley]]
in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]] which I never saw neither did she tell me what they were, was also sent by Elder Turley. Aug 27th I 
wrote another letter to Phebe which I sent by the hand of sister [[Elizabeth Ravenscroft|Elizabeth Ravenscroft]] who went in the same company with Turley. & 
this is the reason why I felt sorry that these things could not have fallen into your hands before you went east, that you might enjoyed 
the benefit of them & obtained the numerous letters which I s[e]nt [page torn] you by that company for I spared no pains to send you any thing 
that was in my power that I thought would make you comfortable, & also comunicated to you by letter evry circumstance of our proced-
ings my labours, the progress of the work, touching upon the sacrafizes we were called to make for the sake of Christ & a Celestial glory 
our long seperation, the cause thereof, when I should return. In fine I used evry exertion to comfort your heart what I could knowing that 
our seperation had been long, but this seperation was prolonged by no less than the work of God & eternal things, many of these things 
were tuched upon, & things about the children on scraps of paper, put into the Parsels, which I expected no eye would see but your
own neithey were they in a suitable state to be forwarded by mail, & the reason that I did not forward you more letters for manâ¬¦
weeks before the company started I was withholding them for private conveyance expectind the company would have started 
much sooner than it did. I sent by Elder Turley & the company about a dozen letters of my own hand writing to you besides all my 
corresponding letters & Journals as I before said. However as you have not obtained them it cannot be helped though I could have wished it 
otherwise, but perhaps you will get the reading of them as soon as I shall the one you sent by Elders [[Orson Hyde|O Hide]] & [[John Edward Page|J. E Page]] for I have 
not yet herd that they have reached [[New York City, New York County, New York|N.Y.]] I have received all your others letters excepting the first & the one just spoken of &

sensation of Both joy & sorrow, of Joy at the Idea of your having the privilege of spending 
the winter at your friends Fathers House & among your friends & that I could the soon
sooner behold your face & enjoy your society while on my visit among our friends
in [[Maine|Maine]], as well as your company on my journey west, calling upon our friends in

[upside-down text] Willford Woodruff
Oct. 20th 1837 [end of upside-down text]I now wish to call your attention back to the first day that I visited the Island. I said
it was on Sunday & of course there was to be preaching in the Baptist Meeting house.
I hastened to the place, meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon he came to the door,
I informed him we were servants of God, had a message to the people, & wished to be herd.
he informed the priest of it. We were invited into the pulpet & our appointment given out. The
priest finished his discourse; invited us home with him, gave us some refreshment. We presented
him the Book of Mormon he did not at first object, was mild & said he would read it. He
soon accompanied us to the meeting house, the congregation was assembled, & it
was with peculiar feelings that I arose to address a congregation upon an Island of
the Sea, to present before them the fullness of the everlasting gospel, & the authentitcity of
the Book of Mormon, as it was the first time to my knowledge that an Elder of Latter
Day Saints ever trod the sail of one of the Islands, or his voice herd by the inhabitants in procl-
aiming the word fo God. I had the strictest attention of all, their appearance indicated a thought
that they had herd strange things to day. When I closed I gave out an appointment for
the four following evenings to be held in the several districts. to cut a long story short suffice
it to say, they came out by hundreds, christian & sinner, captain & sailor, priest & people,
the sound went abroad to the neighbouring Islands, their sails were soon spread to waft
them o'er the deep to hear the tidings for themselves. During the first 14 days we delivered
19 discourses. Many began to believe. The two priests made friends like Herod & Pilate, they
became alarmed, they began to oppose & rage, they had no influence over the people.
The Baptist priest spent one Sunday in his meeting house without a soul to accompany him
while I had a congregation; even his own church & deacon were attending our meeting, 
investigating the subject, & inviting us to visit them. [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinalhaven]] never was as [page torn]
stir'd up before, in peace or war. The priest imediately sent letters to the mainl[a] [page torn]
come over & help us or we fall {shorthand} The Baptist priest fearing [page torn]
not come went after them himself, while while the Methodist priest came from the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Island]] & made
open war against the Book of Mormon & our principals. I attended his meeting look a min-
ute of his discours, & publicly answered his crooked remarks, & he returned home confounded
soon the Baptist priest returned with several others & held a six days meeting, it did not
take affect the mark was torn from the eyes of the people & they began to see clearly, after
I had fairly set our principals before the people, I opened a door for Baptism
& twelve offered themselves as candidates; We led them down into the sea & Baptized
them & of a truth they returned rejoicing: two of the number were respectable sea
captains. The cry from the neighbouring Islands soon entered our ears come over
& preach to us. Some came from the Maine land to hear, & they believe & wish to be bap-
tized, hundreds are believing, & many ready to be baptized. I visited South Island preached
10 times, returned to [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|North Island]], organized a small branch of the church, returned to the Main
land, travled 200 miles with Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] towards [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]; took the parting hand with, [illegible] He has gone to
spend the winter in Kirtland. I returned to Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carters]] after my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]], whose company I am now
enjoying. I shall return to Vinalhaven in few days to spend the winter. I shall not return west I
think start of a year. I shall spend the time on these Islands & the maine land think for a year. I never
before have seen such doors open for preaching, the courthouse in [[Camden, Knox County, Maine|Camden]] is offered me to lecture in
I shall except of the offer when I return, it is the nearest town to Vinalhaven Pop 6000 & a num-
ber have offered themselves for baptism there. Ps. I wish you to direct all of your letters to Vinalhaven Maine, for the 
present, as I shall make that my stand. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time. Tell me of any News you get from our frie-
nds and also inform me if you get the M & Advocate now, the kirtland paper. I shall be glad to call and see you when I go west
but there is a prospect now of it's being some time first. I shall however calculate to see my wife settled in [[Missouri|Missouri]] before I leave
this Continent, which may be sooner than I have calculated, we have now seven Elders in [[England|England]] apart of the twelve, and as
soon as doors are open in [[Europe|Europe]] so that they need help the first Seventy will follow the twelve into that country, and as I am 
a member of that quorum I shall not hesitate to go when duty calls. That the blessings of heaven may attend you in every lawful
calling. & that all things may work together for your good both temporal & spiritual is the prayer of your Brother
Willford Woodruff.
[[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel H. Woodruff]]       Perhaps you would like to know what I have been about since I
I left [[New Rowley, Essex County, Massachusetts|New Rowley]] &c. At least I will venture to give you a brief acc-
ount of matters & things with me. On the 8th of Aug, in company with
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] I arived at Mr [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Ezra Carter's]] My father in law in the State of [[Maine|Maine]],
and you may rest assured we met a most welcome reception amid tears of
joy, and was entertained with every mark of Kindness, respect, & friendship, that
Brethren, Sisters, or Parents were capable of affording. Also refreshed with every
luxury of a Fathers house. I spent about ten days with these my new relatives
& friends;: I spent the time plesantly with my companion in this new circle of friends
composed of five Sisters, three Brothers, & a Father & [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother in Law]] with other
appendages of relationship. I found them to be universally respectable, intelligent,
influential, & possessing some wealth if I could judge from outward appear-
ances of white houses & chaise's &c. four of the Sisters have been ingaged in teaching
School, two of the Brothers in the Mercantile line in the city of [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]] 10 miles
from Father Carters house. Father Carter is a tanner [ink spot] & carrier by trade
& continues the business untill this day. Phebe {shorthand} is 7 days younger than
myself I was born March 1st 1807 & she the 8th of March same month. My wife has
spent the early part of of her life teaching School, & for the last 7 years she has closely
confined herself with her nedle to the Tailoress trade, at which business she was
ingaged in at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] when I became acquainted with her. After an intimate
correspondence with her, I became convinced it was the will of God for us to become
{shorthand} freiiends I offered her my heart, it was accepted. We were joined in matrimony &
we live happy. {shorthand} Phebe is small in stature, possesses
an amiable disposition, is good enough for me; & sends her kindest respects to you
accompanied with her unfeigned thanks for the interest you have manifested in her
welfare; we both much desire to see you &c. &c.
On the 19th Aug; in company
with Elder [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Jonathan H. Hale]], I took the Steamer Bangor at Portland ^PoP. 16,000^ with
the intention of visiting [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|fox Islands]]. We left the Steam Boat at
[[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owls Head]] & went aboard of a sloop which landed us up on the Islands at 2 oclock
Sunday morning the 20th. It gave me rather singular feelings to be landed
upon an Island of the Sea in the darkness of the night, being an intire stranger to
all men in the region; however after wandering awhile over the rocks, we found a house we
called & went to bed. We arose in the morning, made ourselves known as servants of God & asked
if thaere was any religion or priests on the Island, we were informed there was a Baptist
church, & Priest, & meetinghouse in the centre of the Island. I will give a brief note of the town
[[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinalhaven]] is North Lat 44 East Long 69 10. Pop 1800. St. of Maine. The town of Vinalhaven incldes both [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|north]] & [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|south fox Islands]]. The inhabitants
are generally wealthy, healthy, intelligent, industrious, generous & hospitable. The people get most of their living & wealth by fishing. the town fits out 10.7
licensed sail besides small crafts. North fox Island is 9 miles londg & 2 miles wide. Pop, 800. They have a post Office, one store, a baptist church and
meeting house & a Priest. & four schoolhouses, & a grist mill. The land is a rather rocky & rough, yet there are many good farms which produces
fine wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, & grass which ais the staple productions. The timber is fir, spruice, hemlock, & birch. Sheep are the principal stock
upon the Island. Rasp & Gooseburies grow in great abundance.
South fox Island is one mile south of the North Island, & it comes as
near being without any form or void as any land I ever saw. It would puzzle the best historian to give an exact description of it. It is about
10 miles long & 5 broad, and it is one universal mass of rocks, formed into shelves, hills, & dales. Cut up into necks, and points, to make room for
the cooves & harbours that run through & through the Island. one may form some little Idea of it, on learning that it is rising of 100 miles round
the Island to follow the beach in all its wingdings. The Pop is 1000 they get their wealth entirely by fishing. They have some sheep, & some parts
of the Island is under cultivation, but it is at the expens of great labour and toil. Many of the inhabitants fish at [[Newfoundland|New foundland]] & bring the fish home
to this Island, & dry them upon their own flakes, and prepare them for market.: they supply the market annually with great quantities of dried
fish, Mackerel, & boxed herren. They have two stores, three tide saw mills, six school houses, & a small branch of the Methodist Church
& a priest. The timber the same as on North Island with the addition of Pine. There is great quantities of fish inhabit the waters, cooves,
& harbours, of these Islands, such as Whale, Blackfish, Shark, ground Shark, PILOT fish, Hors Mackerel, Sturgeon, Salmon, Holloboat
Cod, Pollock, Tom Cod, Hake, Haddock Mackerel, Shad, Bass, Alewives, Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin, Whiting, Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt,
Skate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Mutton fish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers, Munk fish, Nurs fish, Sun fish, Sword fish, Thrasher, 
Cat, Scuppos, Tootog, Eye fish, Cunner, Ling, Eels, Also Lobsters, Clams, Scollop, Mussles, Pincles, {shorthand} And Porposes, Seal, &c
&c & many others not named.
I have seen two or three Whale in sight at once. I have caught Cod, Haddock, & Hake, as fast as I could
throw out out one line & haul in another. I have stood on the wharf & caught Mackarael out of a large school as fast as I could throw in my
hook into the water & pull it out, they would bite the bare hook. or take bate out of my fingers like chickens if I would hold it in the water
I have been bathing in the salt water & seen numbers of Seal swiming around some of them near me with their heads out of water look like dogs.

Brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]]
As I am called to stand upon the Islands of the sea, in defence
of the word of God & for the testimony of Jesus Christ, I am still under the necessity of
making use of my pen to communicate to you all the information you get
from me, as I am not permited at present to speak with you face to face. There
is many things resting upon my mind, that I wish to communicate to you, even
more than this sheet will contain: however I must be content by giving you
a synopsis of some few of them. Firstly, I have two letters lying before me
which are the productions of your pen, under date of July 22nd, & Sept 27th, 1837. And
dear Brother you may rest assured it is with no small degree of satisfaction, that I am
permitted to peruse & reperuse such letters from a Brother to whom I am bound
by the ties of consanguinity; & in whose best & fina^a^l welfare I feel more deeply
interested than any but mysefl ^12^ is aware of. It is truly a treat to ones soul to 
receive a letter from a friend with whom he he has been long seperated: and been
called to travel among strangers for years, and not permitted to behold with his
eyes the change that time has brought upon the image & face of his friend & Brother. I
never was more forcibly struck with the change of a friend produced in five years, than
in Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]]: and if the change is as great in Brother Asahel I should not know him were
I to meet him in [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]]. Had I room, I should like to be more lengthy in this in
speaking of both of your letters than my limits will now permit; suffice it to say
they are both interesting to mye; And I have not a relative on earth with whom I more 
desire an interview than with yourself, But when I shall have the privilege God ownly
knows. I also receieved a letter from [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother]] dated Aug 23 which was interesting to me;
they were all well &c. As concerning myself, I still enjoying my usual good
health, peace, & contentment. {shorthand} I have thought of late
in my private walks and mediatations, that there was not a happier man on earth than
myself; except such as possess more of the spirit, knowledge, & wisdom of God, than I do; & I
hope that class are many. I am honest in saying, that I feel my peace to be like a river. (do
not understand me to intimate that my righteousness is great) I have every thing of a temporal
nature that reason can demand, to eat, to drink. to wear, my friends are numerous. I am 
not as yet much injured by my enemies. I have a [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] that I love with all my heart
& I have cause to do so. I am blessed in my spiritual calling in preaching the gospel
whareever I go, the word is attended with spirit and power, souls are converted to God, {shorthand}
{shorthand} & even the captains that trade in ships at sea are demanding baptism at my hands;
the priests of the different religions & gospels of the day, are bitterly complaining that I 
am [hole burned in paper] sap[in]g the verry foundation of their churches, & Holy religion &c. {shorthand}
{shorthand} Ah say you Willford boasts pretty well. No dear Brother I have not made the above
remarks in order to boast, for who am I, a poor, ignorant, weak, illiterate Willford. it is not I
that have done these things alone. All these blessings of which I speak have been bestowed
upon me from the hand of God, and if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ.
I know it requires meekness, wisdom, & good sense in times of success & prosperity,
in order to keep humble, & know & feel our prrper place. I do think the Blessings
bestowed upon me of late have had a tendency to show me my own weakness, have
pointed out the source from whence they came, & enable'd me to see that self exhaltation
is not good or profitable. {shorthand}?

Jan 5th 1838 [end of upside-down text]know the days have been & still are in some degree that a man might as well look
for popularity in to-fet as among the gentiles with the appetation of mormon about
tims or toth advocate the principles of Latter Day Saints. & that to because, the world do
not believe the Bible. I have been surprised to see how fearful some of my relatives
and old neighbours were of me in [[Connecticut|connecticut]], they supposed I had turned into an Elep-
fant, Hotantat, or an Arab, & I dont know but this is the case with you if it is I hope
you will some day learn to the contrary, but I see I am of from my subject. I
soon [shared] Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] by an easy appearence & familiararity that I was still
Willford & I am happy to say that I had an uncommon agreeable visit with her
although it was short, I am pleased to have a sister as well qualified to adorn
and [illegible] the female sect, [character] or circle, & I consider Eunice to ^be^. I have seen
some of the world & it is verry seldom I have found a female making better
appearence in company than Eunice she is graceful modest & appears to understand
every crook & turn about right. I must confess ^xxx^ I admire her turn of
mind in mose cases, one in particular, she is not elated with ribbons, ruffles, rings
& ornamenting the body not that I think these is so much sin in these, but I am
proud (if I may be allowed the expression) that my sisters mind is more noble. I discover
some gems in her mind that most of females in riper years are destitute of. Do not
understand me by this remark, concerning dress that Eunice does not dress rich neet,
& tidy, or that her apperrel is not well aranged for she does. in speaking of her [page torn]-
ections I did not discover but one & that we are all of us more or less geâ¬¦ [page torn]
I mean lightness bordering upon what we call rudeness, but I was so chee[rfu]l [page torn]
& sociable with her myself that I had no fa^u^lt to find with her upon that subject
I think Brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] she will answer your expectations & desires concerning
her. I am in hopes with her outward accomplishments she will be a worshiper
of the true & living GOD. I hope your advise to her will always incline her
mind that way she is not insensible of the interest you are taking in her
welfare & I hope you will yet have your reward by seeing her arise
in life doing honour to her Brother, to virtue, to her parents, to all her relatives, to her
country & her God. But I must dissmiss this subject for the present by saying
that if your delight ins in the company of boys & girls in memory of your sister, I would
say that season is past with her & the refinement of riper years would more suit
case. I do not know that I have answered your expectations in replying
to your qustions if ^not^ make further inquiries & I will do according to my abilities.
I receeved your papers you sent me, I shall be pleased to still hear from
you from time to time. Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] thinks you for your notice of her
& wishes to be remembered to you with evey feelingof her soul & hopes yet to see you
Willford Woodruff
Asahel H Woodruff  are there I shall probably see [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|you]]. I am gratified to learn of your prosperity in
temporal business, & I hope you will prosper in spiritual things before you
die. You made one request in your letter concerning sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] which
I will answer with pleasure. In expressing myself to you upon that subject
I shall speak in confidence & unreservedly for, I consider your request
to be perfectly consistant with the interest you have taken in her well-
fare. Brother Asahel you spoke of being disturbed in your subject by a person
coming into the store I waited upon you in this will you give me the
same privilege. [[Thomas Arey Jr.|Thomas Arey]] has just come across the bay with a wherry (what we used
to call a skiff or boat) & wants [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] & I to go home with him & spend the night he says he will bring
us back in the morning & so I suppose I must go I will continue the subject in the morning. [FIGURE] Jan 6th I have 
got back we had a good sail & a plesasent time. the son shines as warm as summer the water most as still as if
nature had ceased to breathe the people say they never saw such weather here before in the winter [FIGURE] I am
glad I did not fill this sheet last night for just as I came into Capt [[Benjamin Coombs|Coombs's]] house this morning Mother Coombs handed
me two letters one of them was from Brother Asahel, Dated [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]] Dec 10th I have red it through & through,
& there is much I would like to say concerning it hiad I time & room. I was glad to learn that you receieve the
mormon papers. I sent word for the Elders Journal to be sent to you, I trust you will get it. You speak of not liking
the stile & spirit of the letter from [[England|England]] for my part I see no impropriety in a servent of God expressing his desires
for the wellfare of his family, if there is I have it yet to learn, however, I do not intend entering into any argument
upon the subject. from your remark I conclude you have receieved the first no of the Elders Journal. Tehere
now the captain has set a bowl of dried raisins before us to heinder me awhile. I hope Brother Asahel you will
excuse this long adjunct flung in the face of Sister eunice. I will haste to answer your reasonable request
I wish you to bear in mind that Sister is advancing in life as well as ourselves
& in giving you a description of her I can do no better than to state simple truth,
which is the best in all cases. Sister Eunice was a child of about 11 years when I first left
her in [[Colebrook, Litchfield County, Connecticut|Colebrook]] the day before I left I took her by the hand & led her out on a
walk of 15 or 20 minutes & gave her good advice the image of her childhood countenance
remained on my mind & I could not bring any other appearance of her to my mind
except the one she was clothed in when I shook her by the hand as a little girl to go to the
west with [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], & this was always the case with me untill I returned last sum-
mer to Colebrook & wraped at her school house door & I will will assume you Dear
sir that wrap was made amid enexpressible sensations, when In an instant our
ownly sister stood before me took me be the hand & saluted me with a kiss, then
at that instant all of her former appearence her childish countenance departed from
my mind & recollection like electricity, yea with the rapidity of lightning. & it is
as much impossible for me now to recall & imagine in my mind how she look'd &
appeared at 11 years of age as it would be for me to imagine how you will look &
appear at 40 should you live untill that time, for you will beare in mind that a
female receieves the greatest change from 11 to 17 or 18 of any period. On seeing Eunice
I found her midling size in stature not tall, rather stocky, but of a pleasing form
with the appearence of a young woman or Lady (not a child) I think she has the looks
of [[Philo Woodruff|Philo]] in her countenance. Wien I first had an interview with her she was vary
resereve bordering upon a distance. I suppose because I was a Mormon priest. you[[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South Fox Islands]] [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinalhaven]] Jan. 5th 1838
Dear [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Brother]]
I have been sitting with my pen in my hand
answering letters most of the time for three days. & as I have just taken it
off from a sheet directed to [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother]] & Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] I thought
I would next put it on a sheet for you. I have your letter dated Nov 24
now before me, & it is with pleasure I spend a few moments in complying
with its contents. In the first place I will give you a short sketch of thing[s]
with me & then answer your qusestions. I took the steamer Bangor at
[[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]] in a hard snow storm in company with [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] my wife to again
visit the Islands of the sea, we had not gone far before we saw the breakers
most high we had a putty [pretty] rough time, most on board were sea sick. we
landed at [[Owls Head, Knox County, Maine|Owles Head]] at night. I reached [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|fox Islands]] the day following
being the 2nd of Nov. I found the Saints strong in the faiâth. I have visited
three Islands since I returned, & also the Maine land. I am labouring
alone in the vineyard. But the work of God is manifesting itself at this time
with great interest in our midst. The spirit of God if like fire in dry stubble 
in our midst. The word of God is like a sharp two edged sword in the hearts of men.
our congregations are large & profoundly attentive. The sea store is
Throng'd when I baptize. Many are enquireing to know what they shall do to be
saved. I have Baptized 19 since I returned to the Islands 7 of the No are
sea captains. I baptized 2 sea captains & a Lady on New years Day,
there is many ^that^ will soon follow their example here. There is now a door
open for me to preach to all the neighbourning Islands, evenâ to the gut of
[[Caneen Island, Maine|Caneer]] & the [[Magdalen Islands, Province of Quebec, Canada|Magdalene Islands]] laying 800 or 1000 miles N.E. of
fox Islands I think of going there early in the spring, & spending a few weeks
I am now on [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|South fox Islands]] sitting & writing at the same table in com-
pany with Mrs Woodruff with the sea spending its waves against the rocks a
few rods from my feet. The ground is bare, the weather warm & pleasent. I
walked out last eve & this morning with Phebe & viewed the sea shore, & stood
for an hour upon a rocky turret viewing the sea foam beneath us. it speaks
the power of God. Will you inform me when you write again if you receieve the
Elders Journal. I should be pleased to have you perus that paper. I gave dire-
ctions for it to be sent to ^you.^  Elders [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith jr]] & [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]] spent a night
in [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]] a short time since perhaps you did not see them. I shall expect

NB 19th I gave out an appointment for preaching in the Methodist meeting house
on the public square in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] at early candle light the
people had but about two hour's notice & their was a thunder storm during
the time so that the congregation was not as large as it probable otherwise
would have been, besides the Prysbeterians had a prayer meeting at the same
time. but notwithstanding these things two hundred or rising of the citizens of
farmington came out to hear me. [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]], [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother]], [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]]. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]], Mary Ann
Hills, cousin [[Achsah Woodruff|Achzia]] were present. Also [[Camp Deming|Campâ¢ Deming]]. & many of the
Cowls'es (God not accepted) help make up the number. I gave them
our principles upon the gospel from Galatians 1st ch 8: 9:verses. I was happily
disappointed oin the manner they treated the subject they gave the best of attention
& herd me patiently while I addressed them about twoo two hours & not
an objection was raised. Doct Carrington arose & manifested much
satisfaction at the privilege of hearing the subject investigated & represented
that they were in conformity with the word of God & his own feeling & most
strongly urged another meeting. [[Samuel Deming|Samuel Deming]] & others requested another
meeting. I Camp appeared satisfyed with the principles held forth. [page torn]

There is a lying spirit abroad in the earth & it has had its influence in
prejudecing the minds of the community at large against us as a people

signs in the heavens & earth indicate facts of great interest to this generation the

I was made wellcome not withstanding my principles which may
appear to be dreadfull in the eyes of many of my friends 
untill they have a true understanding of the matter but as soon
as they have this privilege the direfull veil is rent from their eyes
& they no longer consider Willford such a fated, desperate, & 
dreadful monster or sunk in the lowest depths of vice darkness, error 
degradation & infamy. I would to God that every relative I have
were such as I am this day as touching spiritural things. Aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Cossetts]]
household receieved my teachings & the word & spirit bare record to the
truth I had but a short time with them I spent one night & took the
parting ^hand^ with them next day. 14th I again visited our [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] hous in
[[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] whare I had a happy privle interview not ownly with our
parents but also Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] who had come home to visit me & my
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] while at our fathers house. I ownly had time to take supper with
them & then returned to [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] & spent the night at Uncle Thadeus
Thompson's.  15thI preached again at the School house by Uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozems]]
16th Sunday I preached at Uncle's [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Harts]] to a congregation
composed of my relatives & former Neighbour ma^n^y from [[Cider Brook, Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Cider Brook]]
this was the last meeting I held in Avon. my stay among my friends
was of necessity much shortedr than I could have wished. after the meeting
closed I took the parting hand for the last time with many of our relatives
Uncle Ozem. Cousin [[John Woodruff|John]]. & Horatio. & many others I might name among them. I
employed [[Solomon Willcox|Solomon Willcox]] to convey my friends to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|farmington]] those that
had come out to attend the meeting such as [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother]], Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]], & Phebe
my wife this was the first meeting they had attended of mine & after I arived
at my fathers house. I concluded to spend the rest part of the time in visiting
the old folks, & a happy visit it was to considering the shortness of it being
three days ownly. I took several walks with Eunice & Phebe they seem
to enjoy themselves well together we walked upon the canall & looked about the
river whare we [hole burned in paper] u[se]d to fish when we were boys. it looked verry natural. I hear
many enquiries about [[Asahel Hart, b. 1784|Asahel]] wherever he is known. On the 17th Miss
[[Mary Ann Hill|Mary Ann Hills]] called to pay us a visit. she spent the afternoon & took tea with us
she made enquiries about Asahel & seemed to be anxious to learn of his wellfare.

ville & found the place had altered much since I lift [left] it, it was dull times
with them no business going on excepting pulling down their shops
& building greater they were making about $100,000 dollars of 
repairs. I spent the day in visiting the place Uncle Ozem was at work on
the stone dam across the river cousin [[Samuel Barber|Samuel Barber]] was treading & 
doing well. I preached in the city hall at 5 oclock PM. to the inhabitants of
Collinsville as I commenced speaking the drums commenced beating
at the door's which continued for half an hour, their was some tumult
in the house, however I preached them the word. Some few gave good
attention such as Samuel Barber, Uncle Ozem, & ([[Jerry Humiston|Jerry Humiston]]) ^xx^
who were present. I again preached on the 11th in the Lovly Street

prejudice was broaken down they gave good attention & found no fault
quite a number were quite believeing & three offered themselves
for Babtism I suppose I must tell you who they were viz

Brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]],
I suppose you have given up the idea by this time of ever hearing
directly from me again, but I can tell you brother, that nothing but a multiplicity
of business, would have caused this long delay, and in fact I have for a few weeks
past had no time comparatively speaking but what has been devoted to ^necessary^ household
affairs, have not retired to rest much of the time before midnight, and arise at
4 or 5 in the morning, and you must be aware I think, that after laboring quite
hard so many hours in the day. I must of course, become weary, and consequently
not in much of a writing mood, but the above apologies, bungling as they
are must for the present suffice.
I have, now, Asahel, a privilege which I have never before been favored
with, and may never be again viz. that of addressing a few lines to you upon
the same sheet with Brother Willford. you have learned of course by Willfords
communication that he is now at his [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|fathers]] house in Farmington, a few mornings
ago, after breakfast, says I to [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]], "I will get the front room in order, for
Willford will be here to day I guess."  I accordingly did, and paraded the [wax seal]
in the afterpart of the day, and about four oclock, I cast my eyes out of the [wax seal]
window, and to my astonishment shall I say, when I was expecting it, saw the
well known form of my Brother. I suppose it would be needless for me to express 
our happiness in seeing him. for you are well aware that your fathers sons would ever
recieve a hearty welcome from Father, Mother, Sister, &c. I have so much that I
want to say to you that I very much fear I shall not say any thing of any consequence
we have had uncomonly pleasant visit with Willford so far, and ^are^ especially pleased
with his christian character, which is in perfect accordance with the word of God, and ^as^ for
after striving with the assistance of the spirit of God to investig[at]e the subject, which is looked
upon by the worlds people, (and even those who consider themselves no more of the world) I very
[looked] with contempt, permit, me to say, (by being brief) that I [have] "viz that
of Mormonism 
to be brief permit me to say I have concluded, [this] [with], and that too I [think] ^know^ by the
spirit of God) to be from the Lord, and of coure according unto the word,
Willford has mentioned you I think, of the intended Baptism next sabbath. I really
most want to go forward with others to recieve the ordinance and ^would^ you Dear Brother
advise me not too supposing I felt it to be a duty incumbent upon me! I tell you
what Asahel, I feel satisfied in my own mind, that I shall never enjoy more
religion, if I am not willing to bear the cross and take up on me the name of
Christ. would you for the fleeting honor and pleasures of this transitory world wish
your only sister to barter, her souls salvation for the same, no. I am sure you
would not, and have confindence in you to believe, that in all the anxiety you have
for your sister, you endeavor to keep her best good in view.
[sideways text] [illegible]
You see how it is sheet filled over, and I but just begun, to express my feelings.
Aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Cossetts]] respects to Asahel, have 7 or 8 in our family about all of the time
have two regular boarders, young men that boarded with us last fall, work at
the Methodist meeting house. I must tell you that Uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozems]] Letter
will be amongst 
the number

[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] [end of sideways text]& quite a number manifested their faith in the work & several offered
themselves for Baptism but it was finally omitted for a season & 9 fondly left
without Baptism any in the places but I sowed the seed some of which will bring
forth fruit I next traveled by land to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] & was again
joyfully receeved at a [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] House I have often wished I could have had your
company while on this visit. I never have enjoyed a visit of my fathers house
more agreeable than this, every thing looks more natural at home at this time
than it did last season. Father works hard. Uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]] was sawing shingles
for father last week. I have spent most of my time at Fathers since my return.
I have preached several times since I returned to my fathers house. I have generally
had full attendance, some are believing the fulness of the gospel. Last friday I
went out to Uncle [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna's]]; I found a bea tree on the way, I showed Adna where it was.
I had an interview with Aunt [[Hannah Day Hart Woodruff|Hannah]], she is better in health, but does not yet have her
reason. I spent the night with Uncle [[Thaddeus Lathrop Thompson|Thadeus]], next Day I saw [[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|grandmother Thompson]]

Asahel H. Woodruff[[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] June 26th 1838
Dear [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Brother]]
I have passed through such a variety of scenes, time,
places, change, events, & experience since I last wrote, & my mind is now impressed
with so much I wish to communicate that I hardly know whare to begin, or what to 
say. As I sat down to write in company with [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother]], Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]], & Aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Cossett]]. by
the N.W. window of our kitchen a little putty [pretty] bird came & lit on the window case
by the side of my hand bearing a feather in his mouth & he tried to take hold of my pen
with his bill, what this omen is I know not, whether the bird had a message to you or what his
object could have been remains yet to be revealed I am not verry superstitious concerning
such matters & I leave the subject & haste to my business. I have had an interesting journey
through the eastern sea board towns since I last wrote you. after visiting a number of towns
& churches I arived at the city of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] it being the ^[my]^ first time visit to the city of cours
I spent some time in visiting the different parts of it I went to the top of the splendid
[[Massachusetts State House, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|State House]] & paid some attention to most of the objects that would be of interest
to common historians I walked about [[Bunker Hill Monument, Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Bunker Hill monument]] & in fine I
spent a busy day in visiting Boston, [[Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Charleston]], [[Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], &c. with the exception
of a few hours of the latter part of the day & part of the night following I was closly
confined with locks, bolts, & bars, in Cambridge goal, not for crime but I
went in voluntarily to comfort an Elder of Israel that was cast into prison ahwile
for dept [debt]. I spent several days in Boston and preached several times among the Saints in the
city & I found the church there firm in the faith after visiting [[Holliston, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Holliston]] I took steem
Boat at [[Provincetown, Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Providence]] & traveled by water to the city of [[New York City, New York County, New York|N.Y.]] of cours I saw many
things to interest me here The shipping, the city, the rich, the poor & the market made
me think of Babylon ^x^ more then any thing els. I had a glorious ^time^ here with the Saints
the work of God was progressing rapidly I spent several days in this great city & pre-
ached several [it] times to the people. Our Elders had just returned to NY. from [[England|England]]
they brought cheering intelligence they had Baptized about 2000 & ordained 100 Elders &
the work was progressing rapidly when they left. After spending a few days in the city I
took steam Boat for [[Newburgh, Orange County, New York|Newburg]] on North river from there I walked 40 miles west
to [[Westtown, Orange County, New York|Westtown]] & [[Greenville, Greene County, New York|Greenville]] the people here flung open their public houses, Academies, 
S^c^hoolhouses, private houses, &c. & I preached about 10 days to the wonâ¬¦dering multitudeWillford

May 2nd1838When [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|you]] write to me give me the inteligence you have from any of
our friends which would be greatfully recieved. I have recieved the papers
from your [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|City]] which you sent me from time to time I learned
from your last that Terre Haute was an incorporated City & that you
& Mr Smith had dissolved pardonship & that you was carrying on
your business alone I wish you much success in all lawful
& honorable undertakings & I have no reason to suppose that
you will be [FIGURE] engaged in any other. I would suppose that your
line ^[illegible]^ of business would increase & hold as good as any trade in that
country as the tide of emigration is constant & without doubt
will continue to increase. I am pleased with the Idea of your
locating yourself so far west & I wish more of our friends were
in the western country for the west must increase while the east
decreases in my view. I could not be contented to locate myself
& till the earth in [[New England, United States|New England]] but should delight in it in the west
I presume you are closely confined to your business as your
are now alone & perhaps you do not think of visiting the east [page torn]
at present. I should be happy to visit our Parents & [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Sister]] [once]. [page torn]
I often feel sorry for our [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] considering his age & how hard he has to 
work in old [[Connecticut|connecticut]] alone without any of his Children to visit
him or [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother]] I expect they have many gloomy hours thinking about
it But so it is time makes a great seperation & changes with a gener-
ation. I should be glad to hear from them & know how they get
along. I intend to write a letter to them as soon as I finish this Sheet
I want to hear from Eunice & know whare she is & what she is doing
I have not yet heard any thing from [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]], [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]], or the family.
if you get any word from any of them I should be glad to have you
send it to me when you write.

individuals that have been cut off from the Church in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] (by the voice

I have just arived at Father

I wish here to remark that 
as I may not be stationary at present that I wish you to direct your
communications to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] Maine those that you send to me
at present perhaps you may have sent one letter to [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinalhaven]] that I have
not yet recieved if so I expect it will be remailed to me & forwarded to Scarborough
Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] will remain here at her fathers house until we go west in the fall &
she will attend to all letters sent me she is enjoying comfortable health & wishes to
be remembered to you. I am still enjoying good health. I am expecting to
be gone about two months on my journey to N Y. & it is my present intention
to visit our friends in [[Connecticut|Connecticut]] before I return. I have not herd from
any of them for a length of time. I have not much temporal news to
communicate to you at this time business is exceding dull in this county
some of the Banks are resuming specie payment most of them I think will soon
except the rotten ones which are numerous. This state are waking up as to their
political matters they are determined to redeem themselves from their last
years negligence which I think they will do. Their is a company of Saints
expect to accompany me from fox Islands to the far west in Sept next
should you come east this spring I should be happy to meet you

Dear [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Brother]]
While the Sun is shedding its beams to gladden
earth I sit down beneath a fathers roof in company with my
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|companion]] to address a few lines to you. My last was dated
March [[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinalhaven]] Maine that sheet was principally occupied with the
feelings of my mind upon things future. I would here remark that
a person situated as I am in life & calling knows not whare the morrow
will find him at all times. I have of late held two conferences in
Vinalhaven one upon each [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Island]] & organized a Church in each place
both containing about fifty members & so they are now in a situation
to attend to their meetings without me I have concluded to leave
them for a season & in consequence of recieving some intelligence
of interest from the City of [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] from Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] & others
I have concluded to take a mission that way for two or three months I
shall probably visit [[Lynn, Essex County, Massachusetts|Lynn]], [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Holliston, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Holliston]], & N Y City as we have [Members]
in these places. The work of the Lord is progressing with great rapidity & power 
in the City of N Y. under the preaching of Elder Pratt he is now Baptizing
in the city by day & night he has the use of two meeting houses & also
Tammany's Hall the most noted Hall in the City which is freely furnished and
advertized at the expens of the Infidels as the Priests are disposed to call them
the work is spreading in the county as well as City some come 20 or 30 miles
to hear and obey the gospel & the calls are more numerous than they can possibly
attend to. As to opposition the City is in a general uproar in many parts[,] the
Priests many of them rage and foam & go to such lengths that every honest
man is under the necessity of coming out from them. The Saints are firm
in the City & are ready to suffer death for Christs sake & the truths. I do not
know the number Baptized in the City Elder Pratt writes in his last that 75 have been
added & that the work has but just begun & sayes we are crouded beyond conception
- two pamphlets & many papers are filled against us but all tends to give us
the attention of the people The Editor of the [[Zion's Watchman|Zions Watchman]] is vary busy against 
us & his paper is teeming with falshood & misrepresentation. I have answered himMr Willford Woodruff

[Wilford Woodruff] [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel H. Woodruff]]
Feb 8th 1838serious fault to find with even the objectionable passage
it was only an affair of bad taste and worse
judgment. which ought to have been more than ballanced
by the very good intention which manifestly dictated
the sentence. [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|I]] am ashamed to be caught in such
folly but brother I am prone to it. I do and say
a thousand foolish things which I regret a moment
after and if you could only witness my intercourse
with the world for one day only you would be
surprised to find half as much sense in my
letters as this contains!!
I do not pretend to note half the contents of your
letter. I cannot even reply to that part which relates
to "Sister" except to tell you that I have had sweet
dreams both waking and sleeping about her since
your items.
How much I should delight in visiting you and
your interesting [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Lady]] I cannot well express
I have even thot of going to [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Fox Island]] for
the purpose yet I fear I shall not - at all
events I shall calculate much on the[pleasure]
of seeing you here as you [intimate] next fall
I heard [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith Jr]] preach when he was
here last fall.
Please present my kindest respects to Mrs
Woodruff and all whom you love.
With much affection
Your brother
Asahel H woodruff
Wilford Woodruffour actions thus we are continually misunderstood
and consequently our motives are misappreciated (if [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|I]]
may manufacture a term). I am apt to imagain that
the world is not half so bad as it appears to be though
I must confess my conviction that many persons are
far worse than they seem. We do not know the motives
by which men are governed in their intercouse with us
and hence when their conduct is [opposed] to our wishes
and interest we set them down as bad men, while
perhaps at the same time they are only opposing to
our selfish views the purest principles of their integrity
In refference to your leaving [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]] and joining the "Mormons"
I received my first impression either directly or indirectly
from brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] [than] whom not even yourself could
have felt a deeper interest in a [pernniary] point of view
He was grieved and his friends sympathised with his
sorrow and I in the tenderness of my heart conâoled with
him. I reflected upon your conduct â and passed sentence
of unqualified condemnation uupon it. In letters both
to Azmon and to friends at home I took occasion to
allude to the matters and I spoke of you leaving in terms
of reproach! I would not conceal from you that
I thought you had done foolishly or even wickedly. I
would not recall those thoughts. I do not even wish
they had not occurred for they stand an [evidence]
of my honesty and sincerity. And what is my apology?
You will find it in the imperfection of human nature.
And in appealing to you for your charity â to your brother
for his confidence. I have no doubt I shall meet a
ready response. And formy folly I hesitate not to
believe you will both find an excuse in my apology.
It was silly in me to make the remarks I did about
the Letter from [[England|England]] for really I had no[[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terre Haute]] Feb 8 1838.
Dear brother
[[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|I]] received your truly interesting
letter of 5th January two days since and I am happy in improving
an early opportunity to reply. I perused your letter of Nov
20th to [[Don Carlos Smith, b. 1816|Don C Smith]] published in the "[[Elders' Journal|Elders Journal]]" with
much satisfaction. The account you gave of your ministry
upon the "[[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Island of the Sea]]" in that communication together
with other particulars in your last letter to me enables me to
form a pretty just estimate of the result of your labors. I am happy
my beloved brother to assure you that I rejoice in the success of
those ministers of the gospel of the Son of God who are not ashamed
to declare the truth in opposition to popular error. And although
I confess myself an incompetent judge of the merits of the "faith"
of the "Latter Day Saints" as a system of religion yet, I entertain
an erroneous impression if the struggle between popular secta-
-rianism ^(2)^ and "Mormonism" ^(1)^  is not a strife between liberty
of speech and toleration in religious opinion and [their]
antipodes â dumb [illegible] servility to the prejudices of
education and the trammels of an illiberal bigotry.
You make some allusion to the "reserve" and "distain" of some
of your friends on account (as you [suppose]) of your odd
religious profession. That the deportment of some of them should
be affected in some degree by this circumstance seems to me very
natural and indeed when we consider how very inconvenient
it is for most persons under the circumstances to appreciate
properly the character and motives of the "Saints" it is
reasonable to expect thaât many will turn up their noses and
make wry faces. I do not however [suppose] that in the
care of your early acquaintances you have just grounds for
doubting their respect and confidence for as far as I am
acquainted with their views they give you much credit
for your devotion to such a cause. There is perhaps
nothing cause from ^by^ which we are so much anoyed in
the world as the misconstructions that are put uponMr Wilford Woodruff

Wilford
July 7th 1837blankis progressing rapidly in the earth. I want to say a few words to [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|you]] about the cause
I am engaged in & the course I am persuing. I am sensible we ought to be care-
ful what we put on paper & send abroad & I have at times thought I was not sufficiently
careful upon this subject, lest even friends draw wrong views & conceptions from
my writings & to save any thing of this nature even from your mind & wish here to
make a remark. ie. since my first conncetion with the Latter Day Saints I have
been happy, contented, & satisfied. I know & bear testimony in the name of Jesus
Christ that the Book of mormon is the revealed will of God, & also that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith jr]]
is a prophet of God, & that the Church of Christ is travling out of the wilderness with her gifts &
graces. I know the same signs now follow the believers that did anciently & as I have
prooven this work & know it to be true for myself, I am entirely unshaken in its work
& in consquence of this, my soul being wrap'd in the work, when I have written to any
of my friends (yourself not excepted) I have principly written upon the subject
& this is why I say, perhaps I have been to tegious [tedious] in my letters to you. But I
do not wish to burthen any, of my friends in this or any other way. my ownly motive
for not writing to [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] more than I have since I have been travling, was because
I thought they might not be entertaining to him at this time. I have written vary plain
to Azmon in one Letter it is true, But I have nothing in my breast against him
or any relatives I have in the world. Again I receieved a letter from you last
winter wishing to correspond with me & you wished to know all about my temporal
matters I set down & write you one or two vary full letters, I told you,
about my entering some land in [[Missouri|Missouri]] this land I entered at congress prise piââ
pir acre I ownly entered 40 acres for an inheritance or home, this money was a
present from some friends in [[New York City, New York County, New York|N. Y.]] the Land now I suppose is worth $10 or $15
dollars per acre as it is near the county seat. I also speak of our safety fund that
I took some shares in that, now why I speak of this is, I did not know but you might
draw the idea that I had left the gospel & gone to speculating but this is not the case. I feel
that the spirit that rolls in my veins is steadfast upon the subject, & I shall go tho to the gulentine, faggot,
or death before I shall renounce it the reason of this remark is because I know it to be true. But
enough upon this subject at this time. Now Brother Asahel for heavens sake do not think
that I have drop'd a remark in this letter to cast any reflections upon you or any
body els I have none to cast. Shall it be said that we must be seperated in feelings & [other]
ties of consanguinity severed because we may not think alik[e] upon religious subjects
let God forbid, I love you. I respect you, I have never had cause to do otherwi[se]
& I trust I never shall. I thank kind heaven that I have a Brother whose interest
is manifest for the welfare of [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] & our Parents. Brother Asahel throw a cloak
of charity over my imperfections Letters from you will ever meet a well come recep-
tion from my hand. If I live I some expect to leave this Continent for [[Europe|Europe]]
another season should it or should it not be the case it will be a great pleasure
to me to receieve letters from you from time to time I feel interested in your wellfare
both temporal & spiritual watch the signs of the times remember you have such
a brother as Willford in the world if we do not see each other before we will soon stand
in the presence of God. your parents send their respects to you, [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]] says she will write to you again
soon. I shall also write to you before I leave [[Connecticut|this state]] for the last time if I have any thing of interest for you
should you feel disposed to write to me immediately direct to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|farmington]], con. Perhaps you will not find our all my scribling

[[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel H. Woodruff]]. Beloved & Affectionate Brother
It is under peculiar circumstances & amid peculiar feelings that I take up my pen to once more address you & perhaps trouble
you because of the length of it. But Brother Asahel bear with me this once come now lay aside your Books and convers awhile with
Willford I have much I wish to say to you perhaps you may be interested in some of it. I have thought that I have been burthen
some to you in some of my letters since we saw each other as I have not receieved much of any answer from you perhaps they
have contained to much what the world calls mormonism to have been of any interest to you. But as I have been visiting our
friends I thought it might be interesting to you in some degree to know sumthing about it whare I have been the whys & the wharefores
&c. & I wish to write to you jut as I would talk as easy & simple as truth itself whether it is grammatical or not in or out
of measure. I am not polished in what the world calls learning (anyhow) But I desire to convers considerable with you now & if
I am troublesome tell me of it & I will do better for the future I have had a happy visit with my friends Ill now tell you about it
I left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] the 31st of May & took water at [[Fairport, Monroe County, New York|fairport]] & arived at
[[Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York|Syracuse]] on the third of June the day following I arived at Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmons]]
in [[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richland]]. I had not time to tarry but a short time with them. I was truly glad

father had mooved his family the day before I arived I called at the rock school
house three or four times to visit Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] I do not know that I can
give you a description of my visit with her any better than to copy a page from
my journal which I wrote upon the subject which is as follows
[FIGURES]
June 21st 1837. In Colebrook I wrap'd at a school house door it
opened by a female hand, and lo it was a sister, yes sister Eunice
indeed. We saluted each other with a harty shake of the hand [shorthand]
I conversed with her a few moments with joy, and retired.
June 28 th at 11 oclock AM I entered the school tought by sister
Eunice, five hours I spent within its walls amid as great variety
of sensations as ever vibrated my bosom. I beheld my sister my
ownly sister, seventeen years of age adorned with youth, modesty,
and lovliness with her face veiled with the true picture of [[Philo Woodruff|PHILO]].
with a degree of admiration I gazed upon the change five years
had brought upon HER. HER sprightly step with energy was marked
while teaching the youth. To more perfectly call to mind the rec
ollection of youth and past scenes & to entertain my mind amid the
passing hours, this sister presented me (with a cheerful grace) a
bundle of Letters from an absent brothers I looked them through
and through they pressed my soul with feelings. Asahel yes thy letters
I read fifteen in number to Eunice directed. They brought to my
soul as great a variety of feeling as matter they contained.
They presented to my view, the display of a cultivated mind
& the refined talents of a brother presented to a sister with
the most untarnished friendship and deepest feeling for her wel-
lfare that can grace the human soul. Such teachings as these
to Eunice directed if followed by the female youth would
deliver them from a thousand snares. The name of Willford
was mentioned oft Asahel had not forgotten him. (O heaven pro
tect my Parents my Brethren & my sister) While at once I viewed
this three years convers of Asahel, I smiled, I wept.
Eunice preserve those in memory of a brothers love, regard
these teachings they will lead thee in the paths of safty. I left
the house and by my sisters side I viewed the Colebook land-
scapes as we walked. my soul was pressed. O I spake of
Asahel, I thought of him, I asked what he would say if he knew
whare we were. ah says Eunice he would wish to be here. We
visited our parents dwelling at sages mill, but they had gone
to Farmington we entered the, house and found all as emty,
vacant, silent & still as death. Not a parent or brother to salu
te, we entered the chamber & saw the work of Asahels hands
but nothing left but a stick balanced by a string in the closet
to hold his coat. it was to gloomy to tarry long I droped a tear
and retired believing it more pleasent on the banks of the
[[Wabash River, United States|Wabash]] or [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri]] I took a drink from the well while depart-
ing Eunice plucked each of us a, rose as we left we walked up
the hill while the stones, stumps, hills & dales, looked natural.
We was soon kindly received by Mr. [[Jonathan Stillman|Jonathan Stillmans]] hous
hold took a seat at his board and sup'd together which closed
the scene. HOW pleasing and how painful are the scenes of LIFE

visit a lonely sister thought I, so a steed I mounted at Canaan
to visit Eunice but when I arived she was ^x^ gone to a saleing ^x^ [sailing]

from me I hoisted a flag in token of friendship they discovered

Calling me as a Missionary to

Which call came very unexpected
to me not knowing it before hand.
I am pleased that my Name

that I cannot get my Buisness

provided fore In as short a Notice
that has been given me to get,
ready in and start on my mission
I have been in the Mexican
Mission every since 1885nanknowing what I could
work at, after my school
closed as all of my debts
would just be canci^e^led at 
that time. I will resume
teaching in Davis Co. Mar 31
for a period of five weeks
after which I will arrange
things so I can leave.
If means enough 
comes in my way by

enough money to take
us there.

Dear Brother
I received a call from you, dated the 6th Inst 
to go on a mission to Iceland. In reply would say,
I consider it my duty to respond, when I am called
to do eney thing in this Church, as far as it is ^in^ my
power, and will except the call providing I have
a good partner to go with me, as you want to kno-
w my feeling in regards to the call, I will try
to say a few words on the same. For me to ask for
a good partner is becaus I am very poor in the
language. I came to this country when I was only
6 year old, have not studied the language as
I should have done. I can speck partly but can
not read or write the same. I realise that it will
be hart for me to ^go^ into a strange country with
out an exsperenced missionary. I hope that you
will not exspect me to. I would like to get a man
that is pretty well posted in the Iceland language
and one that knew the country a little. If thair was
a missionary thair now. which I could go to work 
with as it is in other places I would not ask
what I do. My curcumstances is not as good
as I would like them to be I have a [[Svein Thordarsson|Father]] and
[[Helga Arnadottir|Mother]] about 70 years of age to take care of, and
a [[Matilda Christina Thorderson|baby]] 6 months old. its [[Emma Marie Jensen Thorderson|mother]] died 5 months
ago. I will need some help in from the ward in
a financial way. but will help my self allkind
I think this
will be sufficient

Dear Brotherâ. Your favor
of Aug. 15th received.
In reply I would say, that it
is almost impossible for me to 
get ready to go on a mission 
this fall.
My wife died in February;
my only son is in [[Canada, British North America|Canada]];
my things are in such a scatter-
ed condition, that if I were to 
leave now, I should have to
lock up the house and leave it 
to itself.
I have also made arrangements
to get married this fall; and 
would ask to be released, untillnanfor you to bind me as tight in writing as you
like, but one fifth must be paid down before 
I tell it. There will be no more expences
to pay for Lawyers, ect. to go to Washington
to fight for your cause, as it will be smooth
sailing into the Union. I am willing to give
you a bond to the effect, that if you do as
I tell you, and [[Utah Territory|Utah]] do not become a state
within five years, that I will refund you
the money paid me.
Please write and tell me if you will un-
dertake this matter, will you come to see
me? That would be best. Please remember
that often it is the obscure in this world
that is the best inventors.

[[Charles E. MalmstrÃ¶m|Ch. E. MalmstrÃ¶m]].people have unbounded confidence in yourself,
and it would bring tens of thousands of people
into your Church, because they would think you in-
spired indeed, and it would be worth untold milli-
ons of dollars into the Church treasury.
This is not overdrawn as you yourself knows that
if [[Utah Territory|Utah]] became a State, that such would be the
prestige you would have, that the above would
result; and if you but will carry out my scheme,
Utah is bound to be a state in a few years at
most. I have no possible interest in your
Church, as I look upon it as a fraud "from the 
word go." but if you will pay me handsomely,
say: $200,000 00/100 I will tell you said scheme,
if you do not act upon this you have better 
make up your mind to: that your Church will
go to destruction because of the failures of Smiths
Prophesies, but if Utah becomes a state those
failures will be forgotten.
But if you conclude to undertake this scheme
it must be kept absolutely secret, exept to
those initiated, if it becomes public it will
fail. If you aâ¬¦ accept my offier I am willingAdd: [[Springville, Utah County, Utah Territory|Springville]] Jan. 8th 90.

Dear Sir!
The situation your Church is in, and
as you are the head of that Church; your 
situation is at present extremly precarious,
I have a scheme to offer you, that would make
you and your Church triumph and gain a complete
Victory, and I garrantee that Utah would be-
come a state within five years if you manipu-
late this scheme as I will tell you. I am surpris-
ed you have not hit upon it long before now,
it is not against the principles of your faith; and
and is nothing worse than what your people voted
for in the late Constitution, yet the scheme is such
that the Gentiles can not possibly discover the trick
at all, if you but have from 25 to 50 thousand of 
your people you can depend upon; that would do
as you tell them, when you first get to hear it you
will be extremely glad as it will save you from de-
struction and disgrace, and would cause all of yournan[[Salina, Sevier County, Utah Territory|Salina]] Feb 1ts 1890

Dear Bro
Bp [[James S. Jensen|J S Jensen]] sent in my name with other Brethen a few
months ago recommending me to you as been willing to fill
a mission in [[England|England]] but as I was looking after the
tithing of this place would ask that I be excused untill
next spring. I would therefore say that I wish to do some
work in the Temple before leaving and I will be ready
and willing to go to England any time in April next
if you wish me to go. If it is your wish that I
should go will you please notify me now as I have
to sell my team and would like to make my
arrangements accordingly hoping this will meet with
your approval
I remain Yours &c
[[William H. Evans|Wm H Evans]]letter before, that I did not
have any money to start
the journey with, nothing
to make these winter months
and a large family. I stated
in my last that I have 2 sons
that would be a great help to the
family in my absense, if the
Lord would bless them with
health and profitable employ-
ment, but it would ^be^ unnat-
ural to expect that they could
take the whole burden and go
right along with it, and provide
for the family without mater-
ial assistance. I therefore
ask if the time could be ex-
tended a few months, which
would give me a chance to
straighten up some finan-
cially, and be better prepared
to help myself, but in case
that something should turn up in my favor
between now and April 9th
that would enable me to
go, then I will try and report
myself in time. I hate
to have to be so humble,
but it seems to be my lot.

Dear Brother!
Your letter, as a call for me to go
on a Mission to [[Switzerland|Switzerland]] and
[[Germany|Germaney]], has come to hand severall
weeks ago, and I beg your pardon for wayting
so long before I have answered.
My feelings, my wish and desire is, to
respond to the call, and I hope that no
evil Power can hinder me. I hope to
be ready and prepared to start at the
apointed date and from the apointed place.
I do not know what may happen untill
that time, it seems my Enemies has not
forgotten me; I have been absent from 
home since the 8th of March 1887, and
now I have received word that my
Family has to go to [[Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Ogden]] to appear
before the Grand Jury as Wittnesses againts
me. I do hope, that I will not benanfor the people at large before they can avail themselves of the
superior advantages for Education which it is in your minds to
introduce, for to many thousands of our brethren in their
present condition and circumstances the proffer of these oppor-
tunities for proper and advanced Education would be as
the tempting viands placed before, but just beyond the reach of,
the mythological Tantalus. Surely to retain symmetry in
the growth of the Tree of God's planting the temporal, as well
as the spiritual, should partake of the elements of suitable
and consistent nourishment.
For the sake of the principles involved, and that the
nation may not have to answer for the gross and unwarrant-
able robbery and persecution, vastly more than for the
property in question. I hope the U.S. Supreme Court will
render judgment in favor of the Church in the suits now
pending in [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]
Respectfully submitted
Your Brother in the Gospel
Arthur  Staynerand express my regret that the circumstances in which 
you are placed render it impossible for you to extend
financial aid (which however my understanding of the position
forbade me to expect at present), nevertheless I hope that
the portion of said committee's report indicating the advisability
of a postponement to another year will not prevent your
giving moral support to myself and other friends of the
Industry who are entering upon the inauguration of the enter-
prise the present season, and if it be not asking too much
I respectfully solicit that in acting upon the report of the
committee you specify that your sympathy for and moral
support of this movement shall be accorded.
Permit me to say for myself and the brethren who are associa-
ting for the inauguration of the Industry referred to, that we
see in it (and of its success we are substantially convinced)
and the saving of the immense amount of money now expended
and the large profits that will certainly result, the gratifying
possibility of strengthening and establishing other industries
which shall be made to afford or furnish appropriate labour
to large numbers of workmen of various trades & manufactures,
many of whom are now but partially employed and that
in labour to which they have not been accustomed.
We see that there must be an advanced state of prosperity[[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]], Utah, Jany 15th /1889.

On Saturday last the 12th inst, I received a copy of a con:

If the Brethren had seen fit, before they made their report, to
have accorded to me even one opportunity of laying before them

it as a courteous kindness to me, and a respectful apprecia-

the west ^containing a population of some 15 or 20,000 souls^ and is surrouded not ownly with the ^best^ intelligence
& wisdom of the Earth as his council but with thousands
of friends who would in a moment ^if necssary^ lay down their li^v^ves
in his defence against oppression & mobs, & as the time
has arived when we deem it no longer necessary to put
men in office to use our influence in promoting men
to the highest offices of this government who will not act for
the good of the people but for their own aggrandizement & 
party purposes. And we as a people have come to the ^conclusion^ conclusion
to run a candidate for president of the United States at the
next election And that candidate is General [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]].
And sirs the request I wish to make of you is to know 
if you are willing to permit us to use your name as a
candidate for vice president at the next elec^t^ion &
also to invite you to p^f^avor us with a visit at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]
I make this request of your honor according to the coucil
of the Authorities of the City of Nauvoo, and we should be Happy
to see you & you will meet with a welcome reception

God of heaven that it would strike a cord & vibrate your
soul as with the rapidity of light[n]ing yea the silent Language

of my heart. And whenever in my perigrinations I have
met with any master spirits of this kind I have marked
it in my mind & laid it up in my memory for
a future day, permit me Sir to say that inasmuch
as you are one of the most prominant ones with which
I have met in my travels I feel disposed to express my
mind freely to you upon the subject which I have
in view. Sir Those primary principle appertaining to the
Kingdom of God & the salvation of man which we taught
in our spiritual Infancy & in which you seemed to take
a deep interest are of no less consequence now than there
in fine evry day that rolls over our heads adds to its mag-
nitude & importance for whenever any great & Noble purpose
work or plan is put into operation its light & influence
is seen & felt more & more by the Nations of the Earth
Much Sir has been said concerning us as a people, our
motives & principles have all the day long been misrepresented
by wicked & designing men. We as a people are not known in

Dear Sir
I take this
method to break that silence which hath prevailed
for a length of time between us And also to
make a request of you of an important nature
The following reasons are some among the many that
promps me to this course. When I was a stranger in a
strange land Advocating principles of the fulness of theâ
everlasting Gospels of the Son of God Although as true as
any principle that ever emenated from the tr^h^rone of Jehovah
yet the most of all Doctrins unpopular with that
class whose minds are limited to the sectarial notions
& traditions of the present generation instead of expending
to receive the revelations of Jesus Christ which doctrine freequetly
subjected me with my friends to unfair opposstion persecution
warrents &c It was in the midst of this order of things that
I found Col Solomon Copeland among the first to step forth
as a Gentleman, friend & Republican to assist us in maint-
aning our rights & ^you^ not ownly treated me & my friends
with common civility & sociability But all of our
wants were bountifuly supplyed under your hospitable
roof. This Sir was not all I discovered that whenever any
principle was presented that was high, Noble, & glorious that
when carried out would have a tendency to ennoble
man & exhalt him to the highest grade ^degree^ of usefulness,nanover hur at times

Dear Sir:
Recognizing that the Gos-
pel was restored to the Earth
through [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]], and that through
him also Christ's Church was organized,
does that exclude every person, not be-
longing to that Church, from the ben-
efits, blessings, and direct influence of
God, and the h^H^oly Spirit? And prior to
the time of establishing that church,
could any one have communion
with God or the Holy Spirit? Can
people who pray to God and sincerely
believe that their prayers will be
answered. â can such people, not Latter Day
Saints, expect a blessing, or any
answer to their prayers? Can they ex-
pect the manifestation of God's power
in any miraculous way? Could they
work miracles? Can the reach the
throne of him who answers prayer,
and be saved? Are their payers of 
any avail? I have my opinions but
they do not harmoize with those of my 
neighbor. I may not understand the
matter, but I want to and therefore I
have taken this liberty. Will you please
explain it to me.
Begging your pardon for this intrusion
upon your time.
I remain, sincerely yours.

suddenly attacked with sickness a few days before I left [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]

Friends to be the small pox as I had been much exposed to 
it in all stages by visiting the sick, who had it but, it proved other-

Much Beloved Companion
It is with peculiar feelings 
that I seat myself to acknowledge the reception of your kind 
letter dated Jan. 13 & 18th. It afforded [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|me]] much satisfaction as I had 
long and anxiously been looking to hear from youâdid not get your 
letter written Nov. 22th. The last communication but one I received from
you was dated Oct. 31th. The last time before this I wrote you was in 
Dec. after I arrived in Scarborough. I should have immediately 
complyed with your request in answering your letter but it was so late
in the month when it arrived, as you thought of starting the first of April
I thought you would not be likely to get it. I though[t] I would send
you a few lines to [[New York|N.Y.]] hopeing you will get them.
I said I sit down with peculiar feelings because I hope to be permitted
to once more behold your face not many days after you receive this. I think
you will not tarry long in N.Y. (hope so at least). When I came home we left 
N.Y. one night and arrived at [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|fathers]] the next, we came from [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] in the cars and 
stage as the steam-boat did not run thenâit was more expensive. The Portland 
boat commences running tomorrow fare to Boston $2 if there is an opposition boat
it will be less. Our fare from [[Iowa Territory|Iowa]] here was some o over 40 dolls. You
spoke of your baggage box, do as you please about it. I should like to see the 
things you spoke of, if it would be expensive do not bring it but if you have 
any articles of clothing for me or [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willy]] you may take themâof course you will take 
what things you want yourself. [illegible] My health is not verry good this spring
Willy is well and smart. [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]] sends her respects to you and says she wants All things shall work together for good to the faithful. I feel 
thankful that the Lord has opened the way for you to spend the 
winter at your fathers House & once more enjoy the Society of 
your Kindred for a season, & that I can enjoy your company while 
on my visit in [[Maine|Maine]]. I never desired any thing more in my life 
than to once more be permitted to enjoy the embraces of My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] 
& Also to see & kiss the LAD. May God hasten the time I pray. I 
want to ask a question, shall I sail direct from [[New York|New York]] to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]]
& so you call with me in C[onnecti]cut [illegible due to stamp] to see our friends on 
our return. Or had I better [illegible due to stamp] a call both going & coming

April 6th Conference commences here to day and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|I]] am now sitting at sister
[[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylors]] table writting I rode down here yesterday to go to meeting but the weather
is dull and damp and I think it not wisdom to [illegible] go [illegible] to day. [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] is 2
weeks old to day and I feal quite smart. [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] is building up verry fast, there was
one thousand people came in yesterday some to attend the conference but the most of them to live
there. brothe [[Joseph Meakam|Joseph Meakam]] has just come in and wishes to be remembered to he has got better of his
lameness. yesterday I had the satisfaction of hearing from you by receiveing a letter from youâthe breth
ren and sisters many of them ask what are the news what are the news. I suppose that it will be read
to day in meeting as they have carried it acrost the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] to day. brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] says that he will have
4 houses built in Commerc one for sister Taylor [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] [[Thankful Halsey Pratt|Pratt]] & Woodruffâtheir families are well

[Wilford Woodruff] Phebe. W. Woodruff [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]]
April 1st 1840 family after haveing filled [hit] [misn] thy love and fear which may God grant for Chris[ts]
sake.
It seames to be my turn now to write to you mostly [illegible] as this is 
the third letter I have written you since [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|I]] received any from you. I feal verry
anxious to hear from you to know how you prosper in that [[England|country]]âhope you will
tell me all about it when you write. In my last letter to you I gave you an acc-
ount of my sickness likewise somethings concerning the church as correctly as I could get 
them, liveing at a distance from the body of the church but shall now leave it princip
ally for the bearer of this (brother [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]) as he as more of an opportunity to
know correctly about church business than myself. The pre sent present prospect is 
that Congress will do nothing for our Church now as a letter from [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] has
lately been received bearing that I inteligenceâbrother H. will probably give you
the particulars concerning it and all other church affairs I suppose. Brother
[[Pierce Hawley|Hawley]] has got back to his place againâbrother [[Albert Petty|Petty]] is expected back from Tenn
esse every day nowâbrother [[Emanuel Masters Murphy|Murphy]] has been here from that place and wishes to be rem
embered to you he said he used to be acquainted with you and had quite a curiosity
t to see your wilefe wife which I perceive is characterestic of all your southern
friends, I suppose they think that I am a curiosity. I must give way for your [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|son]]
to write some to you. (O papa come home and see me. W.) now [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] wants to writ[e]
some to pa to. (O pa pa come home and se me and baby S.) Thus you see your [page torn]
have written to you in their childlike state, Sarah cryed to write more.
I had like to have forgotten to tell you that brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] is married to Miss M.
Sloan and [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]] says she expects to loose [[Shuah Coffin Carter Moulton|Shuah]] soon. We have lately
heard that brother [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]] and [[Jennetta Richards Richards|wife]] was expected here soon. One of
[[Morris Phelps|Morris Phelpse's]] girls live with me now about 12 years old. Please give my 
respects to brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] and all of the quorum who are there, likewise all
of the saints there. I should like much to go and see them. The sick
ness has abated although many have the chills yet. I have had a num
ber since my confinement but am better of them nowâwant to kn-
ow how your health isâwant to see you verry much. Ah! my dear
Willford hasten your mission as much as you can by being faithful in
the dicharge of your duty and come home to usâtell me in your next
when you think of comeing home I hope next autumâthat looks most
like an age to me to look forward. I expect to write to morrow to sister
[[Mary Stinson Carver|Carver]] if I am well enough. I received a letter from her a month since
but have not b^e^en able to answer it yet. brother [[John Herrett|J Herrett]] called to see me
a while since and says he thinks I had better have stayed in his family and 
wishes to be remembered to you
I remaine as ever your true friend and companion
P. W. Woodruff
(Willford Woodruff)
[sideways text] I sppose that all of the wives of the 12 here will write by brother Hyde. I believe they are all wellanswer â dont know but that [[Eliza Grant|she]] was offended with [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|me]] for my plainness, but could
not well help it, for I felt interested in her wellfare as we have been so intimately
acquainted. I told you in my other letter that I had been liveing by the wayside
as it were since you left me, I have moved 4 times since you, left home; that is 
something for one whose health was as feeble as mine. I moved from [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]]
to brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoots]], thence to my new house then to father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clarke's]] then into a small
house of his in the same door yard, just before I was confinedâI chose to 
go there that I might be more retired. I had every thing at that time that
was necessary to make me comfortable and have been much blest of the Lord.
I missed you much more at that time than before Oh! thought I if I
could but have my Willford to call on instead of strangers what a comfort
it would be to me but that time is past and over now, thank the Lord for it.
Your prayer was answered in my haveing friends to stand by me when I needed
them â the brethren are verry kind about here likewise the family where I now
live. I shall probably stay where I am untill you return â father Clark says
that you need not be concerned about ^me^ untill you get back only pray for me,
he is verry kind.
Have you forgotten our hour for prayer, we have the third
one to join us â sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss]] in [[Maine|Maine]] â she tries to observe the time & although
far distant from each other we have the same God to call on, woh who hears
the prayer of his children. We know not how to appreciate blessings untill
we are deprived of them. We often see people who are permitted to live togather
men to stay at home with their families but me thinks they do not realize
their privileges. I often look on such families around me and think how happy
they must be but I suppose they do not realize it, I even look on black Jack and 
think if I could have my Willford live at home ^with^ me even if we had to work
verry hard I should not mind or value that for then we might enjoy our
humble pittance ^in^ each other's society which gives a relish to every blessing. You prob-
ably remember our last ride togather out to brother [[Pierce Hawley|Hawley's]] settlement to see our
little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]], the prairies were most delightfuly clothed with flowers and 
verdure and I thought it the most pleasent ride we ever had togather, the sabbath
following I rode out to the same place in company with a number of others
to a meeting and to see Sarah the flowers were there but they with every thing
else were dressed in gloom and looked lonely as I felt, nothing looked cheerful
but my little Sarah, I found her health much improved which was 
much satisfaction to me â these with many other reflections pass and repass
through my mind â but in the midst of them something whispers Phebe
do you want your companion to come home to you before he has filled his pres-
ent mission my heart answers no but Lord give me patience and a willingness to 
wait his return and hasten the time that he shall be returned to the bosom of his[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] Lee County April 1st 1840
Beloved Willford
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|I]] have just sent a letter to the office for you but
as another oppo[r]tunity offers itself I avail myselfe of the same in writing
to you, thinking you would like to know how I and my little ones get along,
today our little [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] is 10 days old and I have been out of doors, and sit up
the most of the time and feal to render praise and thanksgiving to my
heavenly father for all his loveing kindness to me through by life, but more
particularly of late through my late confinement. You (probably with 
many others woho have called to see me) would say be careful and not
take cold or sit up to long at first, I have tried to do so. Our little Will
ford is a verry bright looking child with dark eyes his hair almost exactly
the colour of yours. [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah E.]] is as bright as ever and highly delighted with
the babe. I often think how pleased you would be to see him and how
happy we might be with our little family if you could be at home with
usâmay the Lord grant that it may soon be the case. [illegible] I surroun
ded by thousands I should in one sense be like the lonely dove that mourns
her absent mate, who from hill, to hill, from vale, to vale, her sorrows doth
relate. As my babe lay seeping sweetly on my arm thes^e^ words came to my mind
I write them just as they come to my mind.
Sleep sweet babe and take thy rest,
For God looks down and will the[e] bless,
With all that's good, in earth, or heaven,             
If thou wilt keep the commandments eleven.
Sister [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Smoot]] desires the addition of Owen 
to our babe's name. I think that I
shall have quite a present for you when you return if we are spared
all of us to see each other. I have lately received a letter from [[Maine|Maine]], [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Father]]
[[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]] and sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss]] wrote in it, they they much desire a visit from you when
you return, could you not take a ship bound for [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]] instead of [[New York City, New York County, New York|N.Y.]] 
and pass two or three days there, they all much regretted my not comeing
home and passing the time of your absence with them. Father tells me if I 
am ever in want to come to his house where I shall find an asylum â sister 
Foss wants you to take [[Icabod C. Foss|Ichabod]] if you come that way â Mother says that she
expects to loose [[Shuah Coffin Carter Moulton|Shuah]] soon â brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] is married â sister [[Mary Fabyan Carter|Mary]] failes
more and more. I have not heard from father [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Woodruff's]] family since you left.
I heard that [[Sarah Milliken|Sarah Milliken]] was expecting to be married to a man out of the 
church and likewise intemperate the sisters about here, wished me to write to her
on the subject I did, mentioning sister [[Eliza Grant|Eliza Grants]] case to her but have received no
I forgot that I told you about Shuah and Ilus in the forepart of my letter as I have been
sometime writing it. Will. is laying looking at
me as I write in my lapMr's [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]]

[upside-down text] Willford Woodruff Jan 29 1840  
Burslem Staffordshire England [end of upside-down text]be reapted if the wheat is sowed. & God is a[s]sisting his servents in this country, & the work is begining to roll forth 
more & more whare it is faithfully proclaimed & signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I 
believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]], [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]], [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] & that all of the capitol 
places of [[England|England]] will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth 
to come forth from some quarter & they appear willing to hear, receive & imbrace it when it comes unto 
them & while we are preaching & baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to 
preach & baptize in [[Scotland|Scotland]] & thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedily
that truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week & several times on the 
Sabbath & baptize almost daily. Jan 27th I preached last night in [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] to a crowded congregation & a man 
came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon-
ism unveiled [[Warren Farr Parrish|W Parishâs]] letters [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratts]] letters, signed [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]], & [[John Farnham Boynton|John F Boyanton]] [Boynton]. &c &c I was informed 
the man was a Methodist preacher & brought the constables with him because he feared the people. We helped him 
to read it what we could by giving him lights, & water to quench his thirst. I think on the whole it did no injury
I answered him when he got through, & the people herd my answer with attention. All stories & reports that were 
afloat in America are now going the rounds in England, but they will ownly stir the people up to come 
out & hear &c. but I will leave this part of the subject. I have many things I wish to say to [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|you]], but 
you see that I have touched upon a variety of things appertaining to my journey, the country & the vine
yard of the Lord &c in this land. B[u]t I will now say that I feel exceding anxious to hear from you 
by some means or other, yes my desire to recceve a letter from you is vary great. for I have never recceved 
but one letter from you since I left [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] the 8th day of last August, I have written 7 or 
8 letters to you since I left you how many of them you have obtained I know not. I feel vary 
anxious to hear from you & [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] & also about the Church around you, perhaps you may
have written some letters that may be on the way that I may yet get I hope this is the case. I want 
you to write as soon as you get this, wont you & give me an account of all matters & things 
with you & Sarah, how your health is, & how you get along for help; food & rament, is their war between 
[[Missouri|Missouri]] & [[Iowa|Ioway]], tell all the news of a National character, I herd [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] was destroyed by 
the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississppi River]] is it so, how is the Saints getting along in Montrose, Lovely Street, & [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] 
tell me all about it. are they publishing the [[Times and Seasons|times & Seasons]]. give my respects to all the friend[s]
in Lovely Street, Mo[n]trose, & Commerce as far as you have an opportunity. Elder [[John Taylor, b. 1808|T[aylor] ]] [page torn]  
sent a letter home [to] [page torn] his family a few days since in Commerce. I expect Elder Taylor h[as] [page torn] 
written to his family by this time. Remember me to all of our friends unto who you [illegible] [page torn]
write. I shall not have time to send many as lengthy letters as this to America, but I shall endea
vour to give you an account of all important matters with me. & I hope you will write to 
[page torn] [m]e a[s] often as you can convene[i]ntly please drect your next letter [to] Mr Willford Woodruff 
in care of Alfred Cordon ^Club Buildings^ Navigation road at Mr Godwinâs works, Burslem, Staffordshire England. It is a long direc^t^ion
I know but it is my place of address at present, please pay the postage to [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] or it will not come
but if paid there it will come safe. I will also pay the postage on the letters that I write to you as far as N.Y. 
also. I will direct this letter to Commerce Illinois & diret the post Master to inform you of it 
I do this lest their should be some difficulty about the post Office at Montrose. I do not value the writing
of a lengthy letter letter like this if you ownly obtain it. & I do pray my heavenly Father that you may
obtain this letter. & that it may n[o]t [page torn] be written in vain. Phebe I hope I shall continue to share in 
your prayers, remember me consta[n]tly [page torn] at the Throne of grace that I may have Wisdom, grace, & fa[ith] [page torn] 
according to my day: & I do pray the Lord to Bless you, with health & strength & suppoort you in 
the midst of all troubles, trials, temptations, afflictions & distress untill the end come when we may
enter unto that rest together which remains for the people of God. Jan 29th I held a meeting last evening in [[Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, England|New Castle]] & preached to an attentive congregation one offered himself for Baptzm. I have this morning visited 
the large silk factory in New Castle & seen them make silks from the ball or raw article to the weavers loom
whare ribbons, sattins, & silks, are finished. I have since walked to Burslem 3 miles though Parks, lanes, fields, & while the sun 
shines beatiful & pleasant, the parks, walks, & fields, are as green as they would be in the month of May in America. I sit 
down this morning to finish this Letter as I cannot write as lengthy letter as this at once for I am broke 
of by many calls, so I have had several spells about it. & now Phebe wont you sit down & do so by me give 
me a kind of a journal or history of all things with you [&] Sarah. E. since I left you ie if you are able, git
a large sheet & fill it full. I want to know about the sickness & who is dead. & what [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] & [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]] done at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]
& what the prospect is concerning the Church & its progress in America. What news have you from our friends
in [[Maine|Maine]] remember me to all of Father [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carters]] family when you write. I do not know that you will be able to
read all of this letter but make it out as well as you can. please keep this letter & not lose it as I shall wish
to see it when I come home. I do not yet know how long my mission will be in England but I calculate to
labour faithfully while I do labour that I may the sooner get through & again meet with my family
But my Dear Friend & Companion let us try to be resigned to the will of God in all things relative to our seperation
for a season, for it is to do the work of God, to fill a responsible station in preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ
& warn the people of this generation, & prune the vineyard once more, that the children of God may be pre-  
[page torn] [-pai]red for the coming of the Son of Man. & if we are faithful in this great work, & do the will of Jesus Christ & are 
wise stewards over the things commtted to our charge, the war will soon be ended & the victory won, then how
sweet will be our rest, how great our glory, how rich our  reward & how Eternal our happiness. & May the Lord 
Jesus Christ intercede for us, & all Saints that we may overcome through the Blood of the Lamb that when he 
comes we may be like him & reign with him upon the Earth which may our Heavenly Father grant for Christs sake Amen
I remain forever your Companion & Friend
Willford Woodruff
Phebe W. Woodruff quite splendid with the pulpit or stand in or near the centre of the house which is the english custom. Another thing
has attracted my attention while visiting public places in [[England|England]] ie a great plainness of dress with both rich & poor
male & female, their cloth may be equâ¬¦ally as good if not better than that worn in America but they do not appear
as tasty & flashy. I think the Americans pattern more after the French than English in their dress. The Encllish deposit
their dead in vaults in the church yard & them lay the grave stons flat upon the ground over their dead which forms a
pavement to walk upon so you walk over the ded as you go in & out of church. Jan 13th Monday our trunks had to be
taken from the ship & go to the custom Houâ¬¦se & by examined by the Officer. & after much jaming, crouding and 
rocking about, we were permitted to depart with our trunks & baggage after paying 16 ^pence^ sterling on evry pound of Books &
papers that were American that we had with us. We then took the rail road at [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] for [[Preston, Lancashire, England|preston]]. & for the first mile the cars  
run under ground on a track that was cut out of a solid Rock, while buildings & inhabitants were over our heads. The cars
run rapid in England. we arived in Preston, Lancashire, England. at 8 oclok P.M on this 13th day of Jan 1840 in the midst of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & I soon had Elder [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] by the hand & it was truly a happy meeting. I felt to rejoice to once
more behold this Brother face to face & all the Saints who flocked around us with great rejoicings, after spending most of the night in con
versation I retired to rest. 14th Preston contains a population of 60,000 the streets are crouded with the poor going to & from the
the factories wearing wooden or clog shoes which makes a great ratling over the pavement. The poor here in England I should
think were under as great Bondage as the children of Egypt Israel in Egypt. We held a council at Elder Richards house in
Preston on Jan 17th & the following was one of the Resolutions post. Resolved that Elder's [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Tailor]] & [[Joseph Fielding|Joseph Fielding]] go to Liverpool &
Elders [[Hiram Clark, b. 1795|Hiram Clark]] & [[William Clayton|Wm Clayton]] labour in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] & Elder Willi^a^rd Richards tarry in Preston & its neighbourhood & Willford
Woodruff & [[Theodore Turley|Theadore Turley]] go to the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] & warn the People in that place & then inquire the mind of the Lord & if it is his will go
to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]. The potteries contain a population of 65,000 persons & Birmingham 300,000 & the place is larger than New york
& is in the centre of England 18th I took the parting hand with the Saints in Preston & in company with Elders Turley and
Clark took the rail car & rode to Manchester 36 miles whare we were soon greeted by Elder William Clayton & many Saints.
Manchester is a vary beatiful Town containing a Pop of 280,000 souls & is as large as New york on the ground. It already has a
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in it, with 164 members & the work still rolling on. It is the Metropolis of the cotton
manifactoring district in England. I had not been in the place but a few minutes before I was called upon with my Brother
to visit a sister possessed with the devil & a burning fever. When we arived at the house she was in great rage & required 3 or 4 men
to keep her from taring herself to peaces. We lade hands upon her & commanded the devil to come out of her in the name of
Jesus Christ & also rebuked the fever & after a mighty struggle the devil came out of her, & the fever left her, & she was come [calm]
& composed. The devel entered into her child next morning & made it stiff as a stake. we lade hands upon the child & rebu[k]ed
the devil in the name of Jesus Christ & he instantly came out & the child fell asleep, & the woman attended meeting during the day
I do not speak of these things boasting, but thank my Heavenly Father that he is rebuking the devourer for our sakes. 19th
Sunday I preached to day in Manchester to a crouded congregation, it is the first time that I have preached the gospel in England
the people gave good attention, many that were sick came forward to be healed, we lade hands upon 20 most of which were
healed. The ordinance of Baptism was also administered. Jan 21st I left Manchester & in company with Elder Turley took coach
& road (on the outside as the custom is) through [[Stockport, Cheshire, England|Stockport]], [[Macclesfield, Cheshire, England|Mackelsfield]], [[Congleton, Cheshire, England|Congleton]], [[Tunstall, Staffordshire, England|Tunstell]], & to [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] at the Potteries & spent the night with Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Corden]]
This is our place of labour for a few days or weeks. I am now in the midst if the Potteries which are so noted in England whare most
of the English china, crockery & stone were ware is made Pop. 65,000. Their ^x^ is an Elder lives in this town by the name of Alfred Cordon
he went 40 miles to recieve the work & be baptzed & was ordained an Elder. he works in the potter^i^es in Burslem 6 days in a
week for his daily bread & preaches evry evening in a week & 3 times on Sunday & he has alredy a little flock of Saints of
66 in number around him. When We arived in England we found the churches under excellent order & dissipline; the Saints
have the utmost confidence in their Elders, knowing they are the servants of God. consequently they give strict heed to their
teachings. We soon expect most of the Twee^l^ve in this country. We shall then hold a general conference, & my prayer to God is
that all of the Quorum of the Twelve that come^c^ome from America will have means to come soon & labour while the day last
for I believe that what we do in Old England must be done quickly. Elders [[Samuel Mulliner|Mullenner]] & [[Alexander Wright|Wright]] are in [[Scotland|Scotland]] have began
to preach & to Baptize. Elder Wright has had the small pox since he went to Scotland, & the doctors told him to take medicine
& keep warm or die, but he took no medicine continued to go about his business was but little sick & soon got well. persecution
does not rage much yet in England, sometimes the Elders get the candlesticks & candles flung at their heads while preaching &
occasionally stoned in the streets but in general good attention is paid. Jan 24 I preached  in the town of [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] Elder Turley followed
me two were Baptzed. 25th Sunday I preached in Burslem & Elder Turley in [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanley]]. We Baptzed 3 persons. We have crouded & att[en]ti[ve]
congregations. We have now sent out appointments in a number of new places in the adjoining towns. We have found
it to be the will of God to open a door immediately in Birmingham which is about 50 miles from these potteries, one of us will
go there day after tomorrow probably Elder Turley, we are determined to immediately erect the standard in evry town from the
potteries to Birmingham which is a number of large towns & vary populous & whare they have not as yet herd the
word at all, But it will give at least one million of souls the privili^e^ge of hearing the word. I think some of making
Birmingham my stand for labour for a seasons as it is mear the centre of  England & contains a large number of inha
bitants & will open a vast field of labour beteen the potteries & Birmingham. & we have already given out appointments part
of the way. My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Wife]] As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey & of the country
&c. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times & the vineyard of the Lord in this Eastern
country. Signs, wonders, & fearful sights are appearing, & the words of the Ancient & modern Prophets are fulfillings in this land
Eearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] 
so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be in
the heavens. At [[Kanturk, County Cork, Ireland|Kanturk]] Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonfordâs bog land rose up from its mighty bed & travled with the rapidity 
of a steam Engine for the distance of a steam 4 miles through the country carrying destruction in its progress rising in 
angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over 
& in addition to these & many other signs awful awful is the state of things thoroughout England, hundreds of thousands
of people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in the
government they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen & parliment depend upon the Ma^i^litia to
to protect them, & they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel 
war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going th[r]ough the streets begging
Bread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories & out of 
Employ & bread in one day, & I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting 
what to do, & in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity & sin as well as trouble & distress
& it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may go
through. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question &c.
for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhort

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]
While seated in a foreign land I once more take up my pen to fill a sheet for your perusal
May grace, mercy, faith, peace, health, strength, & patience & resignation, rest upon you from GOD our Father & our LORD
JESUS CHRIST. I have chosen a large sheet because I have much I wish to say unto you. I sent you a letter
when I first arived in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] but had not time to write but few words but merly designed you to know of my arival
But knowing that you feel interested in my mission. I will coppy from my journal in this letter an account of my
voyage & travels since I left [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] to the present time, & then make such other remarks as I may have room. Dec 18th, 1839
in New York. I laboured hard all day to prepare for sailing. Three of us went on board (with our Baggage) of the Oxford a regular
packet ship of the New York & Liverpool line. viz Elders [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]], [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] & myself, we slept on board. 19th The Oxford left the dock &
moved out into the stream. 20th At 12 oclock she spread her canvass & set sail, was assisted a few miles by a steam Boat.
She had on board 15 cabin & 64 steerage passengers & Capt [[John Rathbone|John Rathbone]], 1st Mate Yates, 2nd mate Jones, one carpenter & 26 sailors, making
109 souls in all. Cabin fare $1.40 dollars steerage $15. Fair wind & sail well. 21st stift breeze & fair wind most all
on board sea sick. 22nd Most are still sick Taylor, Turley, & myself some sick, a high wind through the day & a high gale at
night, Boat rocked & pitched Badly. 23rd Sea vary rough & winds high, some still sick 24th Sea mountains high & as
rough as the Hills & valies of [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. when we were in the trough of the sea, the waters would appear to be an hundred feet
above us in the air, the waters broke over the ship, & I got vary wet, & as their was no fire to go to except to cook by, I sat on
deck in the wind untill late in the evening to get dry, & though it was winter it was not vary cold. 25th A calm in the mo
rning, the ship rocked bad upon the dead swells, wind soon rose & we sailed well 26th A rough sea & strong Breeze. 27th fair
winds, but some short squals. got over sea sickness, have a sharp appetite 28th Rough sea saw a large school of Black
fish & porposes. 29th pleasant morning & high breeze though the day. 30th A rough sea severe gale at night. it was with diffi-
culty we could keep our births, while at the same time, Boxes, Barrels, & trunks were tumbling about the cabins. This
with the noise of the Officers, & sailors reefing & taking in sail, together with the sound of the roaring winds & rushing waves
made much confusion. 31st Sea rough, sails under class reef, cloudy weather. This is the Last Day of 1839. Their is
not much to interest the mind while taking a voyage at sea. (excepting the roo^ll^ing [P]illows which are magestic) for one
is frecquently for many days without the sight of land or ever seeing a sail at sea, & must be crouded thick
together in a cabin or stay upon dek in the spray, wind, or storm &c. JAN. 1st 1840. So time rolls along
rough sea, blustering, cloudy, & high winds 2nd The sun rose clear, it being the first time we have seen it for 5 days
we have a calm, a sail is in sight, the first one we have seen since we left New York it is stern of us. 3rd Fair & good breeze
sail 12 miles an hour. We spoke a British Brigg from [[Halifax, County of Halifax, Nova Scotia, British North America|Halifax]] 20 days at sea bound for Liverpool in Long. 34.40. We past her
with great speed. 4th Fair weather & wind, stiff Breeze & fast sailing. They had a time of butchering hogs & sheep on board.
5th rough sea, high winds, & rain. We saw a large school of porposes. A calm & pleasant evening which we spent on deck
viewing the stars & Ocean. 6th A calm we have 12 sails spread. 7th A dead calm to day in Lon. 17.40 The passengers shot a number
of fowls which fell dead into the water. We spoke a Scottish Bark from [[Leith, Midlothian, Scotland|Leith]] Scotland bound for Granada a west Indies Island 7 days at
sea. We saw a large school of Black fish some of them were 20 feet in length. 8th a good wind. a lighted bar Barrel was sat afloat
from the ship at night which appeared Brilliant at sea. Jan 9th cloudy & cold. smooth sea & fair breeze. We are about enter-
ing the [[North Channel, Europe|St Georgeâs channel]]. !!! Ho !!! Ho the cry of land land is herd from mast head. We went on to the forecastle & after straining our
eyes for a few moments we got sight of it. It was the [[Ireland|Irish Coast]] lying 3 points to our lee bow. this is the first land we have seen for 20
days. At 8 oclock PM the revolving lamp at the lighthouse a cape clear came in full view. 10th The mountains of the Irish
coast, & also 6 or 7 sail is in ful view weather cloudy, & rather cold. We walked the deck untill 9 oclock viewing the light
houses &c. 11th We had a heavy gale commenced at one oclok in the morning. We were in danger having the Irish coast on one side
^the^ coast &^of^ [[Wales|wales]] on the other. their was a great bustle & noise on board from the captain, Mates, sailors, winds & waves &c. We
reached the pilote ground at daylight & raised colours for a pilot... a pilot Boat soon appea[r]ed & came along side & sent a pilot
on board of us, who arived in the midst of the gale. The pilot informed the captain that the steam ship Liverpool had not
yet arived & she left New York 5 days befor[e] we did. & that the packet ship Independance had not reached Liverpool & she left
New York 10 days before us. This intelligence created a great shout of rejoicings on board the ship, for it was the first time
that they had known a steam ship, beaten by a packet ship. but the intelligence was no sooner commun[ic]ated
before the steam ship Liverpool [here] in sight behind us & was gaining upon us. The pilot ordered the sails to be
unreefed notwithstanding it was blowing or gale & we were soon out of sight of the Liverpool again. We had not
sailed but a short time with this speed before the town of Liverpool in England was in sight & an English steam
Boat soon came & took us in tow & soon brought us along side of the quay in Liverpool upon which stood
thousands of human beings looking to see us land. the steam ship Liverpool came up just as we landed
& fired two salutes of cannon at us as she past by. & Also the packet ship Independance came in in a few
minutes after. It was truly a singular circumstance that the Oxford, steam ship Liverpool, & Independance should
all reach the quay at Liverpool within 20 minutes of each other, when one left N.Y. 5 days & the other 10 before the Oxford
but so it wasâ¦ Thus you see after 22 days sail we arived safe in Liverpool in good health & spirits & for the first time
I began to tread the soil in Old [[England|England]]. We took a walk into the streets of Liverpool. & visited some of the 
most Noted places of the Town, such as New Market, Custom House, Lord Nelsons Monument, &c. all of which
were splendid. The Market contained a vast variety of evry kind of meats, fish, fowls, & vegitables that I ever saw
The Custom House was built of hewn stone in the form of an H and covered four acres of grouned. Lord Nelsonâs
Monument is all of Brass about 14 feet high & 3 rods around it their is 4 large personages as large as life with a chain
around their necks ^hands^ with one end of it in the mouth of a Lion, these are 4 Kings that Lord Nelson subdued in his day.
Lord Nelson stands above those 4 Kings holding 4 crowns [FIGURES] in his hand, & death stands by his side partly covered
with a shroud with one hand upon his Body. these are some of the prominent features of Lord Nelsons monument though
there are others of miner consequence. He was killed in batle while commanding his fleet, his monument is much
Noted in England. Their is not as much taste in general in pollishing, painting, & garnishing the out side of the buil-
-ldings in the cities & towns in England as in America, but they build more for duribility, their buildings are
far more expensive than in America, for they are composed of vast masses of huge stone or brick, though some of their
buildings are far more spe^l^ended than those of America. Their is one thing vary disagreeable throughout England, the whole
hemisphere or air is filled with smoke, smut, & gases, that rise from the dens population & burning of coal &c., the air
is vary heavy & bad for the lungs, but the weather is not cold as in America, it is quite mild weather notwithstanding
England is in 51 to 55 degrees North Lat I have not seen a flake of snow since I left New York is^t^ is 3,500 miles from  New York to
Liverpool. Jan 12 Sunday I attended meeting at [[The Church of St. Paul, Liverpool, Lancashire, England|St Pauls Church]], [[The Church of St. Thomas, Liverpool, Lancashire, England|St Thomases Church]] which is the church of England I thought it vary
singular to hear the Rector's, & Curitâs preach against a form of Godliness without the power theirof & professing religion without
having the fruits of it. while perhaps their is no people more formal than themselves. In the evening I attended meeting at
Pitt street methodist chapel, the speaker appeared quite co[z]y & simple in his manners. All of the above named churches were[[New Egypt, Ocean County, New Jersey|New Egypt]] NJ

Willford Woodruff (To Phebe)
New Egypt New Jersey Nov 29 1839^The following Page is for your Private perusal^
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] I know you have made sacrafices, & great ones to, you have made
them for Jesus Christ & his cause, & you have made them for me: some of
them have been of such a nature that it hath required all the powers of the
soul to pass through them, & those sacrifces still continue, even our seperation
is required for a season in order to do the will of God, but I think you are
sensible that no worldly honour or Earthly gain would cause this our seperation
No nothing but the commandment of God. Notwithstanding the gate is strait
& the way is narrow O! do not shun it, walk in it, yes walk in it for my sake, & seek
not death, but livie, yes live for me. Our sorrows, our trials, our sacrafices soon
will end, & in that rest that remains for the people of God thou shalt be comforted.
Stand by me & maintain thine integrity untill we enter those glories that are
to be revealed at the comeing of Christ & thy joy shall be full. O! the glories of
a celestial Kingdom I long for thee, for thee I pay my sacrafice. O! kind hearer
seal my prayer, grant my request, give me an enterence with my rib my child
within thy gates, & glorify our souls with Eternal light & truth & united pow-
ers inseperable. Ah Phebe I have had to much of a taste of those Eternal &
Almighty truths appertaining to the Celestial Kingdom of God, to let go my grasp
I have put my hand to the plough I cannot look back, I must
finish my work that My father hath given me to do, & I have confidence
to believe that I shall have your assistance unto the End. I know I have
my imperfections, & it is with a degree of sorrow that I reflect upon some
past hours of my life that I might have spent to better advantage & more to
the happiness of myself & others, but my determination is to spend the future
according to the best light the Lord giveth me, [loft] me up by your prayers and
confidence you have mine. I will try to prevail with the hear [page damaged]
your behalf that the Lord may comfort & heal you & support yo[u] [page damaged] On
the deepest wounds of affliction & sorrow & enable you to be res [page damaged]
to the will of God in all things, & wait patiently for my return. Should it
be our lot to enjoy a long Eternity together in that society whare tears are
wiped from all faces & sorrow & sighing are known no more, we should
not regret having passed through trials here in the flesh. All the ancient
Saints & Jesus Christ not excepted had their trials to pass through but they
are now glorified, & as it is now our turn & we are living in this last dispensat
ion & have a great work to do, then should we not act nobly, walk by faith &
do our work in patience untill we can say it is finished. We are not alone
in this great cause, the Heavens are deeply interested in our welfare, our
cause, & our work. It is true we have a great warfare to accomplish in order to over-
come, the power of the enemy is greater than some suppose. It has already required
God with the armies of heaven to wage war with him that Satan might be cast
down with his influence. If so then we have strong powers [to] contend with
but with the assistance of God we likewise will overcome. I feel not at
all discouraged my way is onward. I am detemined to run the race (by the help of God)
that I may win the prize for myself & family. When I meditate upon the dealings
of providence with us both since our connexion, the manner in which
he has delivered us from the power of the Enemy, & saved us from the jaws of
Death, & supported us in the midst of trials of the keenest nature, I still feel
disposed to trust in his name, rely upon his word & [seorve] serve him unto
the end. O! may the Lord bless thee, comfort & support thy soul untill thou art
perfected in Christ Jesus; (do not fail to write me as soon as you get this, tell me all the news. are
you in your new house & comfortable. has Sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] herd from Brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] if so whare is he, give my respets to her
But while all nature is wraped in midnight darkness I lay down my pen & retire to rest & think of thee. Good night Phebe

I left you I was able in body to take a regular course of preaching I preached

that I was not privileged with a few words in [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|your]] letter upon the subject as I
was so long on the way myself I expected to have found then all in [[New York City, New York County, New York|New york]]

it is begining to be cold weather & as I am some out of health I feel it my

deel I want to say to you in this lietter. As far as my health is concerned it has
been vary unsettled I had but one chill after I left home which was [illegible]
day for about 4 weeks I took however some of Sapingtons pills which
stoped my chills & fever & I had no more untill I arived at [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]] with the
exception of a light chill in [[East Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana|Germontown]] Wane County Ia which was brought
upon me by preaching & sitting down by a window & the wind blew upon me &
I was chilled Br [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] followed me though he was v[er]y feeble in the first stag[e]
of the Billious fever I have not roon to tell you much about it for I suppose
he hath written to Sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] before this time & informed her of it. I was oblieged
to leave him in Germontown but It was with a family of the kindest people. but
as I was feble Brother Taylor wished me to continued my journess & he would tary
untill he got well he was vary Sick 2 weaks & the fever left him low & it took two
weeks more to recover his health I have not seen him since but am expeting him
in this [[New York City, New York County, New York|City]] every day. My chills returned as I took the canal Boat in [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albay]] in
consequence of being in a storm on [[Lake Erie, United States|lake Erie]] & taking cold I had a chill Evey day
for 8 days but they were light, & soon as I arived at [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|fathers]] my chills stoped for

Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]
Notwithstanding we are at times flung into the deepest suspens in
consequence of not hearing from our dearest friends for a season yet I rejo-
ice that the day comes when we understand the cause of all & our minds are
unloded of its burthen. As it has been with you so it has bean with me
in one respect: I have looked with feelings of the deepest interest for a letter
from my Dear Wife (in whose bosom my heart has a resting place) but I had looked
in vain untill I began to think that I should no more hear from my Phebe &
[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] untill I left the Shores of [[North America|America]] But thank the Lord my great suspens
& fears (for great they were) are now removed. yesterday after spending several hours with
Brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] in his Store (who is well & in good spirits) I went to the post Office
as I have done almost every Day or sent. I again called for a letter & to my great
joy I recieved one from you with a few lines from Elder [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] under
Date of Sept 19th 1839. I wrote you a letter at [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] Ill 20 of Aug paid
the postage on it & requested you to write to [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]] Ny. [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Ct &
City of New york. I am sorry you did not obtain that letter for I gave a [sheet]
account of my travels the way the Lord put means in our hands. my preaching &
visit among the Island Saints I visited the grave of Brother [[Charles Brown|Brown]]. the resignation of Sister [[Mary Arey Brown|Brown]]
was great the whole church sent their respects to you. I also wrote a letter to you on
the 30th of Sept at Farmington ct [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] also wrote I also gave you a brief account
of my travels in that letter & paid the postage on the same I am in hop^e^s you will get
that letter I perceieve that those letters that are post paid are more liable to miscary
than those that are not so I will not pay the postage on this letter & I pray the Lord
that it may fall into your hands. As regards your Situation in Sickness I truly
feel to sympathize with you & Sarah, your situation has been shone me I have had
several interviews with you since I left home & I have been aware that you
was in affliction. but your patience & resignation in your trials as great conso
lation to me & I can still have confidence my Dear companion to invite
you even in your Deepest trials to leam upon the arm of that God who has
upheld you untill the present day we can do no better than to trust in him
whether in life or Death. the Saints all seem to be much afflicted this season
But may the Lord have mercey upon us all I pray & not take our lives from
the Earth but that we may be humble & finally have a victory over the destroyer
but even should we die some of us it would be in one of the best of causes
& we should sleep but a short time before we should be awoke & meet together
in a glory Celestial to part no more whare sickness & sorrow is known no
more But yet I expect to enjoy Blessings with you & Sarah in the family

Sir; a fiew days since, Prest.
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith Jr.]] and somone others ware
assembled togeather to attend to some church
business, when it was thaught proper to select
those who ware designed of the Lord to
fill the places of those of the twelve who
had fallen; mainely [[William Earl McLellin|Wm. E McLellin]], Lyman E.
Johnson, [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]], and [[John Farnham Boynton|John F. Bointon]].
The persons selected were [[John Edward Page|John E. Page]], John
Taylor, Wilford Woodruff and Willard Richar-
ds. On the following day five of the twelve
with President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] and some others met
and resolved that President Rigdon
write to Br. Richards, Who is now in
[[England|England]], and inform him of his appoint-
ment, and that [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] write to
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and inform him that
the Lord had commanded that the 12
assemble in this place as soon as possible.
and that I should write to yourself.
Know then, by this br Woodruff that you
are appointed to fill the place of one
of the twelve apostles; and that it is
agreable to the word of the Lord, given
very lately that you should come
spedily to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Farwest]].
And on the 26 of April next to take
your leave of the saints here and
depart for other climes acrost the
mighty deep!
Yours in the Love of God,

[Wilford Woodruff] [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W Woodruff]]
Aug 5th 1837reception of your of your letter dated at [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] and makes many friendly remarks
upon the subjects of friendship connections mormonisn &c&c. We have received a paper of
late from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]âthere was not particular news in it accepting that the inhabitants of the
Citty [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|far West]] had chosen 2 Judges 14 Justices of peace and established a post Office.
Therefore I fear that your letter will get lost by the Office being in another place. I
finished that letter which you commenced to [[Sarah Woodman|Sarah]] and [[Aphia S. Woodman|Aphia]] the next sabbath and
sent it. Tell brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] that there was a letter came to the Office for him a day or two
after he left here. I will now forward it to him[e] with this. The health of our family is
good with the acception of [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Motherâs]] and I think her much better than when you left, she
wishes to be remembered to you. I have been quite unwell one day and night of late
but have far recovered. sister [[Shuah Carter Woodruff|Shuahâs]] school closes this week and sister [[Rhoda Farnham Carter Scammans|Rhoda]] expe-
cts to be change her situat^i^on in life next month. brother Fabyan and wife send their
best respects to you likewise allof the family. You said that you felt easey about me
well I am receiving every kindness that my fathers house can afford. I have been spend
ing some time with sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss]] she wants to see you much. Brother [[Brother Toronsen|Toronsen]] works just
above thereâhe called on us Sabbath afternoon and spent the eve with usâwe had a little prayer
meeting which seamed quite encourageing. I feal that I am almost alone spiritually therefore
I hope that you and brother Hale will continue to pray for me for I feal that I nead the
prayes of all who have access to the t^h^rone of graceâYou shall have mine. When the eve twilight
comes [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] wishes that she could see and converse with you for a few moments at least, but
she cannot at presentâshe can retire in private and ask the Father to keep and presere you
and give you wisdom knowledge understanding and strength equal to your day. I hope that
you will be faithful and that all the people on the Island will be wise in time to secure
their salvation. Was I near you I should like much to go to meeting with you occasionally.
You requested me not to send any letters to brother ^H.^ if they come to this oOffice after the 15th. of this
month and that you should come in about 2 months are you expecting to stay longer
than he does. I recollect those pebblesâchildren are pleased with something new. I have not
learned styrography yetâbut am waiting for you to come and learn me. Write often for I [illegible] [like]
to receive a line from you any time. I am expecting to go to [[Portland, Cumberland County, Maine|Portland]] tomorrow to spend a
few days. Give my best respects to brother Hale and accept a large share of them
yourself. I haste to close as the clock has just struck 11 and retire to rest.
May the peace of God ever rest upon you is the sincere desire of your Phebe
Phebe W. Woodruff â
Excuse mistakes for I perceive
them verry frequent while reviewin
this[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|I]] shall get through. It is a verry darke time here nowâit appeares as though
every ones heart is closely shut against the truth in this place and [[H. Harmond|H. Harmond]]
is as bus^i^y as a bee in the summer in putting down mormonism as he calls it
he says he is determined to put it downâYet I rejoice that the hearts of some are
open to receive the truth even on the Islands of the sea and pray the Father of Heaven
that you may have many souls as seales of your ministry. Believe me Willford I
have not forgotten you or brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] once ^since you left^ when alone before God but asked him
to open the hearts of the people to administer to your temporal wants and give you
access to their hearts that you ^might^ speak the words of life to them and receive it. I am
pleased with brother Hales prosperity as it is some ^thing^ more new to him to travel and
pr^e^ach than for you. [[Jeremiah Willey|brother Willy]] said before I left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] that he would not
hold one meeting alone this summer, thus we see that he was mistaken and I rejoice
in it. I think that he will make a mighty man for God if faithful.
You mentioned something about letters comeing to the Office for you I have taken out two
one from Mother [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Woodruff]] bearing date of Aug. 22 â and one from [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel H. Woodruff]]
from [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terrahaut]] bearing date of July 23rd. directed to you in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], it was taken
out there and then remailed and then remailed and sent to [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]]. Mother Woodruff
mentions the reception of your letterâthe bank note and the bowl of bread and milk
w^i^ths with which you was favoured on a day of your journeyâthinks the promis not
made void that as thy day thy strength shall be says that the health of her family is
good or that hers is not quite as good as when we was there. she says that she was about
to write to Aunt [[Anna Hart Cossett|Coyssett]] when verry unexpectedly [[Betsey Cossett Alvord|Betsey]] came into the house and
her mother soon followed her. says they came away in haste hopeing to see you
againâsays it was her intention to have been baptized had you been there. Mother
told her she was in hopes to see you again this fall. she has written to [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmondsâ]]
family and to Asahel and sayâs her sheet was well filled she gave the particulars of
your visit with them and the reception you met with among your relat^i^ves. she says
that she wrote something to Azmond and [[Elizabeth Woodruff Frisbie|Elisabeth]] by request of sister Coysett
the substa purport was this, that from an interview with you she believed you
to be right and engaged in a glorious work. and Uncle [[Ezra Day Hart|Ezra]] was much di^s^appoint
ed in not seeing you and hearing your discourse at uncle [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adnerâs]] as he did not hear
of it before it was to late. [[Ahira Alling|Mrs. Alling]] called on her (Mother) recently she said that
her mind and heart was open in view of this subject. Uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]] has lost a child
of late. As her letter was lengthy I have just given you a few items and preserve
the original for your perusal when you return. also of Asahelâs he mentions the[[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]]  Aug. 5th. 1837
Dear Willford
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|I]] have sent to the Office a number of times since you left here
hopeing and almost fearing that I should receive a line from you. I say fearing
lest it would say that you was not about returning as I have been pleaseing
myselfe with the I idea that I should soon see you again although I have felt
anxious even to hear from. If you reco^l^lect you mentioned not writing if your
stay was shortâbut let me say that your epistle came to hand last eve and
met with a pleasing reception. I perused its contents and was truly rejoiced
to hear of your good health and spirits likewise of your prosperity in the cause
of Christ and that the Spirit of God attended you and brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] and opened
the way before you booth temporally and spiritually as I felt verry anxious about
you knowing your circumstances and that your temporal meanes were verry
limited. Well we will acknowedge this to be another proof that the Lord is
not unmindful of his servants and all that put their trust in him. He is
able and will give us that which is best for us, although the way seames verry dark
before us sometimes, yet he sees fa^r^ther than we do.
After reading your letter I
[fe]lt encouraged and satisfied to have you about your masters business although
I have felt some lonely and would like much to see you and enjoy your company,
yet I think that it will be much better for us both to be in the place appointed to
us by God, if it is to be separated a while than to be elsewhere.
Willford I per-
cieve that the day is at hand when the salvation of souls and a seat in the celestial
kingdom of God will be of more value than the shining ore which many spend their
whole time and talents in persuite of in this lifeâ therefore I hope that you will
ever be diligent in keeping the commands of God and in dischargeing your duty fai-
thfully to this gene[r]ation that you may be the sooner discharged from your warfare
and be permited to dwell (with one in whose affections you share largely) in peace
and with the approbation of heaven saying âI have fought the good fight I have finised
my course I have kept the faithâ &c&. If we seek first the kingdon of heaven we have the
promis of all things being added to usâyet my heart will sometime distrust providence
I then take a review of the dealings of God towards me and the promises left on reco-
rd for those who keep the commands of God. this stimulates me to diligence and
persevereance and to try to endure to the end and then obtain a crown which
I trust is laid up for me if faithful. I find it to be rather hard liveing here spir-
itually as there is much darkness and opposition in these regions but my faith is as
strong in the gospel of Christ as ever and I think if I keep close to the rod of ironMr. Willford Woodruff

Dear Willford
Haveing just returned from meeting with
brother Smith and wife where I was expecting to see you as brother
Smith was expecting you and brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] to be there I learned that
you was gone to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] and wished to know when I arrived
in the this place I would just say that I got here (to brother Smithâs)
yesterday about noon. had a good passage was out ten days. was detained
on the way 2 days. came alone from [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]]. brother [Wed] and wife
came as far as there with me. I received your kind letters the Sabbath
after they were written by the hand of brother [[John Gribble|Gribble]] and the contents
[page torn]isted me much without it I should not have been able to have come
[page torn] as I was dis-appointed in selling those skins all but 3 which
brother [[David Harvey Redfield|Redfield]] to and paid me six dolls. I should have answered
your letter immediately but was expecting to come immediately and
therefore thought it unecessary as I though I should get here nearly
as soon as a letter but I was detained many days longer than I expected
to be. There was something ^said^ by some of the brethren about your returning
to this place again before we went to [[Maine|Maine]] but they could not realy
tell what therefore I am calculateing to start next saturday for
Farmington if you think of comeing come before that time if you
can. The brethren ^are^ anxious to have me stop and make a visit
which I [havecluded] have concluded to do so as to rest myself
as I was much fatigued when I arrived here. br Give my respects
to brother Hale and tell him that his family are well but his [[Olive Boynton Hale|wife]]
did not write by me for want of time but sends a message by
me to him which I will deliver when I see him. I do notI made mention to you respecting the Church in [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]]
I have since learned that that Church principly had [mo[ved]]

would read the Messenger & Advocate the paper published at

ownly a form of godliness and deny the power thereof. In fact the faith of the Church
of Christ of latter day saints has not ben sufficient amid such a world of unbelief
to perform many great miracles The sick have been healed & speaking and interpeting
other tongues are common but thanks be to God if the Church continues to go from
grace to grace and from faith to faith it will soon lack no good gift and as the
Lord is the same in time and in eternity yesterday to day & forever if we as saints
are pure before him what Enoch saw we can see what Moses did we can do what 
Peter had we can have what the saints endured, we can endure and what

want to exchange & most all have sumthing

proclaimed war against Mexico. It is a heathy
time in Nauvoo. The [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] & [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo Home]]

Lord is begining to Bless us here in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. We
have Baptized 36 & many othrs at the water
[[William Copeland|Doctor Copeland]] & an Independant Minister
are among the number Baptized. Our little
Room is almost getting full of Saints without
the World & as the place is begining to be to
strait for us we are trying to get a chapel or
larger house so that we may dwell. Eldr
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] has also organized a small Branch
of 6 members in [[Woolwich, Kent, England|Woolwich]], he Baptized 4
the first time he preached there, & the seed
sown is Bringing forth fruit & they are trying
to open a door in that place also, & Eldr
[[William Hill Pitt|Wm Pitt]] is Baptizing some at [[Ipswich, Suffolk, England|Ipswich]]
& so if the Lord will enable us to build
up a kind of a Zion in London & have
some stakes around about it we shall be glad
there is begining to be much inquiring[[Ellen Balfour Redman|she]] says she can get a Book of Mormon for us to

Been a great traveller through the East Indies & othr
parts of the world, ship wrecked several times taken once by
the Indians & once by Pirates, & last of all she thinks she
thinks she has not come to [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] for nothing but does
not yet know what the Lord will do with her We truly
had a good time together. She calls upon us tomorrow
& attends our meeting. Pray for us in this City, &
give my respects to all the Saints, 400 Saints in [[New York|N. Y.]]

Yours of this

pleased with the news with the exception
of the loss which Elder Woodruff has sustained
with him I feel to mourn for it brought forcibly
to my mind the death of my little daughter [[Lydia Pratt|Lydia]]
Sister [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] must feel disconsolate I cannot but
sympathise with her as she is now left entirely
alone. It is cheering to hear of the prosperity of 
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. It forcibly reminds me of the vision of
Esdras in which he suddenly saw a woman in great
trouble weeping with great lamentation but sud-
denly there appe^a^red in her stead a great city. It will
not take the Jews long to build Jerusalem at that
rate. I think that the sin of laziness & indolence
will not be imputed to the saints much longer
for they seem to build cities with almost as much dex-
terity as children build cob houses & I presume they are[sideways text] and resume his Labors in that place I think those fealings will

few itims that escaped my notice, Capt [[Samuel Bogart|Bogart]] (Bogart) of
mob memory, has killed a manâran away & 500$ is offered for him - 
[Oho] - it is reported in the papers, says, 'Bro [[John Greenleaf Holman|Holman]], that the Indians are
ma[ke]ing sod house among the corn&horses of upper [[Missouri|Missourie]]
& the inhabitants are much afraid & that the Indians are
making preparations for war to go against them &
"O, their end their dreadful end."
Gen 10 chap 9th verse
well among other things I was thinking of a bit of
an out & asked Bro [[Thomas Kington|Kington]] for 50 Stars to
take along with meâhe examined and found he 
could not spare one more than 40 Nos. Now if
Bro [[Orson Pratt|Pratt]] has any Millenial Stars on hand, I wish he
would send us 250 as quick as possible and if he
has not any ^that^ he would print some without delayâ& I would
recommend, with the approbati[o]n of Bro Woodruff, that 100 copies
of each No be carefuly laid aside for the benefit of the Quorum [at]
the end of the release. There are regular carriers passing
Bro Kingtons weeklyâfrom [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|manchester]], if you could find their office
I think you might send the papers cheaper - by them. please [d]o let
us know when the next paper is going to press.
I do hope some means will be devised to offod these paper for 6 pence [Yours] &. [[Willard Richards|Willa[r]d Richa[r]ds]]

Elder [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]]
Dear Brother
I supposed you noticed that I did not answer
any of your qustion in my last letter which you asked in March 27th the truth is I
did not have time ownly to glance it over hastily & hurry since looked it over care
fully I thought I would sit down & write a few lines more to you. I remarked
to you in the last that I wished. you to come soon & labour with me awhile I did not
as fully give my reason for the remark as I ought & should have done if I had room. But I
would here remark that I did not make the request thinking that I had any power, desire, or
wish to controll you. But Becaus it was the desire of my heart, & feeling that I need
council & assistance for much depends upon the manner the field is governed here
I want to hold several councils or conferences in this region & ordain officers in
the different Branches Besides their will be many to confirm. I have confirmed about
100 & their will soon be another hundred to confirmed & I have just as much
as I can do to preach & to Baptze daily without confirming. theirfore I stand much
in need of some assistance & council in such a field. I have Baptzed about 40 preachers
of the Unted Brethren primitive Methidist. [&] it has flung into my hands about 50 esstablished
places of preaching which are licensed including one or two chapels. & you can see at once
Elder Richards that it am overwhelming labour to be upon one man. & he needs his spirit
sanctified & his Body Immortal to stand such a labour & it has put me at times to my
wits ends to know what to do with so many places of preachings & preachers, But according to the Best
wisdom I could get I could have pursued the following course I have finally told the preahers
to continue to fill their appointments & teach righteousness & try to prepare the minds
of the people for the fulness of the gospel, but not to administer in any of the ordinances of the
gospel untill I can have some help & set in order the churches & ordain such persons
as God shall call. the reason I have done this is the as soon as the preachers disappoint the 
meeting & congregation those houses of worship will be shut up & sants might be shut out
of the Kingdom that otherwise might come [in] tell me what your feelings are about such
a course. I am well aware Brother Richards their is much to do in many places But
it does appear to me that their is no field at present in [[England|England]], whare your labour &
council is more needed or would be of more benefit than to join me in this field a
season. I have no controll at oll over you in this matter. But should consider it a great
privilege & favor to labour together awhile you with you. If you can set in order
your house & leave Sister [[Jennetta Richards Richards|Richards]] a season with some friends or friend, I think you
would enjoy Bettr health here as it is entirey a farming country. Should you come will
you please remember to Bring me the first No of [[Times and Seasons|times & Seasons]] & the Book of written Rev
that I left with you & if you come by the way of the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] will you call upon Brother Wm
Hulme in [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] & ask him to send to me that Little china Box a present from Brother [[William Rowley|Rowley]]. I have written
to Brothr [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] but had no answer as yet. if either [[Preston, Lancashire, England|preston]], [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]], or the potteries churches
felt to do any thing for him as you come along you could conveigh it to tim in [[Stafford, Staffordshire, England|Stafford]] as
you pass though. If you can any way come soon I should be glad to see you I wonder
why the Twelve do not come from America. I feel as though word ought to be soon sent
for 20 or 30 or a whole quorum of the Seventies for I dont see when their will be a Better
opportunity to prune England than the present. I Baptzed 13 the day that I wrote your letter 9 yesterday &
many tomorrow & Sunday (Write after [1] pence a letter) If the Moon family gets ready would it not be well
to give them a Recommendation & let them go. did the three families go from preston. should you
be in [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]] alone their is a lane neary opposite the Market house walk down that street by a tan yard 100
yards & enquire for [[Francis Pullen|Francis Pullen]] his [[Hannah Thomas Pullen|wife]] is a Member. I am sorry about Brothr [[Samuel Mulliner|Mullener]] I wondr
what is the Matter of him whether he is under any transgressing or whether it is the devil desireing to destroy
his usefullness I am inclined to believe the Latter let us pray for him that he may be supported untill
some Elders come [that] one go to his assistance I think of writing him a letter to day as I have not yet
I am now leaving all confirming for another time & shall appont meetings for [that] purpose &
I pray God that you may be with me to assist me in it. It is strange that none of us hear from 
America I have not herd from my family for about 6 months. It seems that Abisah & Abiram in
Preston begins to think that Moses takes to much upon himself but they must be careful that they dont
burn their fingers give my Best Respects to Sistr Richards let not her courage fail, [Rememebrre]

I am ever yours in the Love of God

Dr Brothr [[Willard Richards|Richards]]
I received your letters last evening also one from Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]]
I have but about 10 minutes to write to you at this time, & while writing to 
you at this time I have several conversing to me so I have to write & answer
questions at the same time, so if I make a blunder excuse it. Dear Brothr
I have much I want to say to you. I have just written to Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] &
enquired all about his circumstances & expet he will answer me immediately
& we must do what we can for him both by faith & works. It is 
begining to become the day of Gods power here in some degree. & I 
hardly know what make of it all. for some cause no man dare meet
me in publick or come nijh [nigh] me at all to oppose me I have not had the
first word of opposition in publick, but yet the whole world is stired up here
all the Church Ministers are holding conventions here & they find they cannot
stop me or the work by law & they are afraid of looseing their member &
they have come to the conclusion to sink pools & baptized their churches by
immersion as the ownly way to save them. they sent to one of their constables
to take me up but they sent to the wrong man for before the message came
to him I had Baptized him. one of the clerks of the church is intending to be
Baptized but I have not yet given him an opportunity. my labours have 
mostly been at [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|Frooms Hill]] 5 miles from Ledbury I never preached in 
Ledbury untill last evening, & notwithstanding I did not know a soul that
lived in town, yet a large number flocked around me in the streets as 
soon as it was known that I was in town & gave me a hearty shake of 
the hand & the Baptist minister came to me rejoiced at an [interview] flung open his 
large chapel for me to preach in went with me into the pulpit & prayed mighlyly for
God to bless me & I preached to the largest congraâgation ever met in the house 
the Minister & rest m[e]mbers in town are Belveing. I have about a dozen to
Baptize to day on Sunday I Baptized 13 confirmed 35 & B & C 9 yesterday I Broke Bred on Sunday
to 100 saints. Elder Richards one word more to you & I must close this sheet. I want you 
to come immediatey & be a coworker with me in the vineyard here I cannot do 
the work alone I am called to Baptize 4 or 5 times a day I want no better man than 
yourself to council & labour with me here & help me reep this mighty harvest if you 
have nothing on but rags come I want your person come & God shall bless you with 
health & strength come by way of [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] & get what you can for Br Turley
& call & see him at [[Stafford Jail, Stafford, Staffordshire, England|Stofford goal]]. from [[Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England|Wolverhampton]] come to [[Worcester, Worcestershire, England|Worcester]] then enquire
fromr  Froome's Hill. & [[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill farm]]. I want an interview with you as soon as you come
before you meet much with the churches. If you can leave Sister [[Jennetta Richards Richards|R]] with any frie[n]ds
a little while so do, dont fail of comeing Dear Brother if possible
whether you come or not write immedtialy

Answerd March 27. âbut being gone longer than I expected [[Willard Richards|your]] letter arived & was opened by Brother [[Theodore Turley|Turley]]. But I
have sent orders for no more letters to be opened that are sent to me. And with regard to the
question you asked me on the scrap of paper. (I say yes let them eat or drink what they will in such cases)
I should be pleased Brother Richards to hear from you often & give me all the news you have
from any quarter I was pleased to hear of doors being opened in [[Scotland|Scotland]] tell me whare
I can direct a letter to Elder [[Samuel Mulliner|Mullenner]] in Scotland. also inform me of any information
you get from any of the Twelve I wonder why they tarry so long in Americ[a] may the Lord
hasten them to his country. Also inform me concerning sister [[Jennetta Richards Richards|Richards]] health from time
to time give my love to her & tell her I should be exceding glad to see her but when I shall
get out of this part of the vineyard I cannot tell. pray for me Brother Richards that I may be meek
& humble that I may fully overcome evry speces of pride & self wrighteousness [that] I may feel
my dependence on God in all things, & that I may know the mind of God concerning me in all
things. A word concerning you & Sister Richards. But what am I that I should teach or instruct
thee or inquire the will of the Lord concerning thee. O that I was more worthy that I might greant
thee the desire of thy heart in this this thing & that I might more fully know the mind of 
God concerning myself & all things that are required at my hand that I might be more fully
prepared to greant thee thy request. But if you can receive it at my hands I say unto you thus 
saith the Lord let not my servant Willard Richards litely essteem his calling or station for I have
called him & he is a chosen vessel unto me & no man shall ever do his work or take his
crown. for he is humble & seeks my will, his afflictions shall work together for his good in
the end, let him be not weary in commtting his case unto the Lord or trusting in my n[a]me
& I will bring it to pass & the darkness shall pass away & the light shall come. & I [page torn]
break the bands that bind him & lib[er]ate him from those under his charge for they [page torn]
not worthy & some are under condemnation for litely essteeming the priesthoo[d] [illegible]
whome God has set over them. Let him still call upon me in Mighty prayer & be not weary
committing his companions & all his ways into my hands & I will work out his deliverance
in a way that I have prepared, & he shall yet have many souls as seals of his ministry, & be
mighty in council, & much beloved by his brethren the Twelve. Thus Dear Brother is
the voice of the spirit concerning you & I would say to Sister Richards by way of council to try
not to be discouraged nor desire to die but to live. though your afflictions may be
great for a time yet consider what Jesus has bourn, commit all your ^ways^ unto the Lord
you will ere long enter that rest that remains for the people of God then your
morning will be turned into joy & you will be satisfyed with the goodness of 
the Lord I feel as though the Lord will open a door whareby you will be liberated
before many days I will pray for you before God that your faith fail not & that
you may have grace & strength according to your day. whatever is manife[s]ted
unto me I will endeavour to communicate it unto you from tine to
time. Write me soon Brother Richards & dont be discouraged God will be your
friend. I should be glad to see the second No of the [[Times and Seasons|Tines & Seasons]] should you
get one please send ^it^ to me at [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]]. Any thing you may have upon your
mind pleas communicate freely It will meet a welcome reception
W Woodruff
Excuse my scribling I dont have time to write plain [w]aybounded into the water to me stark naked excecpting a loose cloth around their legs but I put a
stop to all disorder as fast as possible. & again I am Having a mighty struggle against this [illegible]
power of falling down like a dead man stiff as a stake which is in some of the preachers as well
as the people. I have to handle all these things in wisdom. among the number that I have &
are Baptzing are some large farmers having 3 or 400 acres of land I have Baptzed sone constables
as well as preachers. there is a Merchent in [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] that we Baptzed that trade is so bad that he is wind
ing up business & wants to go to Zion with the Saints. I have Baptzed most of his relatives
here several Brothers & Sisters here he has come down to visit them he has said sumthing to
them about it. & they all want to [trans] up business here & move with the Saints in
the U.S.A. & in fact most all the Saints are getting the same spirit here without my
preaching it. I do wish the Twelve would spedily come to [[England|England]] that we might hold a council
somewhare about these & many other things. when [[Willard Richards|you]] next write to me say a word to me
what your mind is about this. the farmers here feel like this that bad times are coming & the
sooner they can turn their property in to gold the better & in fact with the view I have of the 
times I cannot advise them as yet to the contrarary. you begin to see Brother Richards that I must
have much to occupy my mind at preasent considering what I have to do. & in addition to
this I have just recceved a Litter from Elder [[Alfred Cordon|cCordon]] at [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]]. Stating that Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] is 
taken with a States warrent & put into [[Stafford Jail, Stafford, Staffordshire, England|Stofford Gail]], it was done by a man in [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]
for an old Debt that Brother Turley contracted 15 years ago before he left England, or in other words
Turley was in partnership with a man & when they dissolved Turley gave up the stock into his
hands to seell & he supposed it was all settled but now the man claims that he did not
sell the stock for as much as he expeted & that he has still claims On Turley. [[John Jones|John Jones]]
in Burslem was connected in taking him It is merely a trick of the Devil to stop his
preaching but I believe the Lord will overturn it for Gdod how long he will be confined
in prison I do not know. The whole Labour at the Potteries is now flung upon Elder Cordon
& when he wrote me he was some out of health & should their be any faithful labourer at
liberty would they not do well to go into that part of the vineyard & assist. And again in addition
to this case I have a certain Brother Richards whome I love of a truth for the truths sake that dwelleth
in him & I pray God that it may be with him forever & he asks an interest in my prayerrs in 
his behalf & his companions that the Lord may manifest his will concerning them. I will now
say Dear Brother I will gladly comply with your request the first leasure moments I can
get, in fact I have attempted two or three times since I recceved your two Letters upon the subjet
to lay the case before the Lord but no sooner than I would begin to pray some one would bye
wraping at my door for me to go & baptzed them or for sumething els. in fact since I recceved
your letters I have had no spare time hardly to pray for any thing, for you see how things are 
with me & of course can judge how my time is taken up. I scarcely pass a pool of water but
what sumbody is waiting there for me to baptze them. & in fact if John had more Baptizing to
do when all Judea & Jerrusalem went unto him to be Baptzed, then I have had for a few days past he
certainly had his hands full. But do not think dear Brother that I shall close this letter with out
answering the questions you have asked me & expressing my feelings unto you No God forbid 
not with standing I have not had time to lay your case before the Lord as I could wish, yet I have a word
to express upon the subject. In the first place I wish to say I recceved your twoo letters & have read them over
several times. & you speak my mind perfectly with regard to any other persons opening any of our letters
excepting our own Qurorum. & when I gave permision for a letter to be opened should one come before
my returned, I did not then expet to be gone but vary few days before my return & it was 
under the impression that if I had a letter at all during my absence it would be from Brother
[[William Clayton|Clayton]] in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]], & as they wanted to hear from him I gave them that priv^i^lege with a charge
to say nothing concerning the contents if their was any thing that the church should not know[[Hill Farm, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Hill farm]], Frooms Hill Ledbury. Herefordshire, March 25th 1840
Elder [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]]
Dear Brother. May grace, preace, strength, faith & victory, rest upon you & Sister [[Jennetta Richards Richards|Richards]]
from God our father & our Lord Jesus Christ. Dear Brother ^it^ is amid peculiar feelings that I take up
my pen to address you this morning. I have so many things in my mind at this time that
I wish to communicat & so little time & room to do it in that I hardly know whare to
begin or how to End. I feel that there never was a store House ten story high filled from top
to bottom with Merchantdize that cant have more of a variety in it than I have in my mind
at this time. & I hardly know how to go to work to give you a description of my situation
but I will try to do it by parible. figure, similee or sumthing or other. I am far from
feeling vain vane or like trifling lent I take the Liberty of making expressions to you that I
would not to the world, that you may ketch my view of the situation of things here. In the first
place permit me to say that I never before witnessed such a scenery as I am Experiencing here
neither did I every expect to in my generatoion. The Lord of Hosts is with me in power & sone
some of the time the Devil to. I have had some mighty Battles with the devil sword in hand since
I have been here & God has enabled me to give him a deadly wound & routed him out 
of his camp & he has fled from me wounded & roaring like a Lion [&] I can hear
the sound of his roar about 10 miles off & I expect him to return for an other Battle
by & by for you are aware thant an Enemies camp cannot be brock up without some
noise & so you can form sumthing of an Idea of it from the following description.
I have been here 21 days preached 20 times & Baptized Mr [[Thomas Kington|Thomas Kington]] the superintendant of the
preachers of the United Brethren, a branch of or broke off from the Methodist Church & with Mr Kington I Baptzed
23 preachers of the same Order that was under his superintendance & also I Baptzed 46 of the members
of the same church making 70 in all, this scenery has committed into my hands & charge
& my controll mostly 45 esstablished places of preaching most of which are licensed according to
Law, & also 48 Preachers 24 of which I have already Baptzed & most of the rest are ready as soon
as they can have an opportunity. as I said before I say a gain their will be a mighty harvest
here for all the churches which these preachers are over are ready to receve the word. should I judge
from outward appearances I should think their would spedily be 500 Baptzed in this region &
probably more still I dont wish to count chickens before they are hatched. I am now Baptzing
about 10 daiy daily day before yesterday 12 & yesterday 9 sone days I have to go in the water 3
time a day. I Baptzed 6 preachers yesterday & I have a number to Baptze to day. yesterday 3
preachers came in a charriot or Gig to visit me they never had herd me preach at all. I had on wet
cloths & going to the pool to Baptze. I testified of Jesus Christ unto them the power of God rested upon
us & they kneeled down & wept & prayed, & their Gig stood still & they all went down into the pool
the same hour & I Baptzed them & they went their way rejoiceing & praising God. Mr Kington is an
humble man I have Ordained him an Elder & I ordained two priest their will be many worth[y]
labourers raised up in this country. you see by this time Brother Richards I am not Idle but
have much to do & need much wisdom from God to do it well, for it is the strongest
fishing ever I have done & I domt expect any thing els but while gathering the Salmon I shall get
among them some ells & snakes for their has already been sone after they would were Baptzed that would
pitch & Bound like a porpose or jump & roll like a hen with their head cut off manifesting ev[er]y kind of
spirit but that of order & if ever an Elder had any triming to do I expect to have my share of it
by & by for in doing such a rapid work as this I have to become all things to all men for I
cannot get time to do much triming as yet. in fact some have before I was aware of itMr [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]

Elder [[Willard Richards|W Richards]]
Having a moment of leasure time I spend it in saying
a word to you. their is quite a change of the place of labour with me since
I last wrote, Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] returned to the potteries from [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] writing
me to go there to erect the Standard as it was his native place & though I should
do better there than himself he had preached a few times in publick this side of 
Birmingham & not in Birmingham & as I was getting ready to go the Lord
manifested to me it was his will for me to go another way, which was beyond
Birmingham or about 40 miles South West of it, & I was obedient to the 
word of the Lord, & travled 80 miles & stoped at the house of a large farmer
by the name of [[John Benbow|John Benbow]] it is called the Hill farm as the first time of this
letter I arrived at his house on the 6th day of March & preached at his house in
the evening & Baptized 6 persons four of which were Methodist preachers. On Sunday
the 8th I preached at Benbows & Baptized 7 four of which were Methodist preachrs
On the 9th I preached at Sandy Hill & Baptzed 7 two of which were Methodist
preachers. On the 10 I preached at John Benbows & Baptzed 12 persons 3 of which
were Methodist preachers. I have Been here 5 days preached 6 times & Baptzed
32 persons 13 of which are Methodist preachers. The noise has gone ahead
through all this count[ry], & their is to be a Mighty harvest here, the work is
but just begun, & I marvel what God is doing here, I have not as 
yet had a word of opposition for evry priest as yet that has come to me has been
molted down & cast his plow as it were at my feet, & reci[ev]ed Baptism at my
hands, & in fine they are opening their appointments for me to fill & I never
have beheld such a scenery since I have been in the church. I marvel
at the work of God here the Lord of Hosts is with me, & I expect the Devil soon
there fore pray for me their is to be a great gathering here. write to me soon
& tell me all the news you have Direct your next letters to (Willford

GG[sideways text] P. S. Since Br [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] Came to [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|this place]], we have been favored with a lengthy
revelation, in which many important items are shown forth! First. that the 
Church, shall hereafter be Called "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
day Saints" Seceond it saith ^says^ "Let the City Farwest be a holy and a
consecrated land unto me, and it shall be called most holy, for the ground
upon which thou standest is holy: Tharefore, I com[mand] you to build an house
unto me, for the geathering togeather of my Saints, that they may worship me". [&c]
It also teaches, that the foundation or corner stone must be laid on the 4th
of July nex[t], and that a commencement must be made in this following season,
and in one year from the 26th of April last, the foundation must be
again commenced, and from that time, to continue the worke untile
it is finished. Thus we see that the Lord is more wise than men, for
[[William Wines Phelps|Phelps]] & [[John Whitmer|Whitmer]] thought to commence it long before this, but it was
not the Lords time, tharefore, he overthrew it. and has appointed his
own time. The plan is yet to be shown to the first presidency, and all the
saints, in all the world, are commanded to assist in building the house

April 30, 18385th, and after lbouring dilegently three days in succession, it was unanim-
ously agreed upon, that the town pPlatt, with 4 ^four^ eighties adjacent
to the platt, should be at the disposal of the Bishop and his council
the High Council, the two presidents, and the two apostles.
During this labour the two presidents acknoledged they were wrong, and they
to all appearance willingly suffered themselves to be corrected by the Council.
In the begining of May following, the Council again met, and resolved
to to have the above m^n^amed property transfered into the hands of
the bishop, as an equivalent to the Poor bleeding Zion money, and 
that the avails, of said land, should be thareafter applied to the benefit
of the poor, and other public purposes. The business of the transfer
of said property, was transacted by the two presidents, the Bishop and his coun-
cil, and by some meanes they managed to bind the bishop in a heavy
mortgage ^of three thousand four hundred and fifty dollars^ to apply two thousand dollars of the avails of the town plat ^Which they had subscribed^ to
the building of the House of worship, which they intended to build ^have^ erect[e]d;
Since that time, the affair of building the house has falen through.
Consequntly, many people have withdrawn ther subscr[i]ption to
it, and these two men, claining this two thousand dollars as their
subscription, chuse to withdraw it, and put it into their own pockets.
aA small part of which has been already paid to [[William Wines Phelps|Wm W. Phelps]].
The Council, not feeling ^willing^ that the Church should be defrauded
of two thousand dollars of her public funds, and also know^ing^ that
the Church in general as well as themselves, had become dissattisfied
with their conduct as Christians, in many things, appointed a
committee to labour with them: after which, they called the whole
church in Zion togeather, who almost unanimously voted them
out of their presidenceal office.
Not long after this, the Council
saw cause to appoint a seecond committee, to wait on these men
who still presisted in their opposition to the interests a [page torn]
the Church. aAfter which, charges were prefered against them
before the Council, which were substantiated, and they were
excommunicated. Also, the Church has had much sorrow durring

Their opposition to our beloved Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith Jr]], and
the best interests of the Church of Jesus Christ, ^[On]^ for presisting in
the same, a number of Charges have been substantiated against
them, before the Councils & bishop of the Church, and they have 
also been excluded from fellowship. "How has the gold become dim
the most fine gold changed"!!! But [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|I]] mus[t] drop this subject for want of
room. Suffice ^it^ to say Brethern, J. Smith Jr & [[Sidney Rigdon|S. Rigdon]] are now
with us, the Church now flourishes, and the Saints rejoice,
and the ^internal^ enemies of the Church are down. You will see by the above
prospectes, that your anxious desires for the [[Elders' Journal|Journal]] are about to be granted.
May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, bless you, and keep you unto
his coming and Kingdom, Amen! My love to all the Saints in those
regeons.
Yours in the Love of God.

Wilford Woo[d]ruff  How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned from
Rigteousness to wickedness? They did not understand, that by taking
upon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of the
Church of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church,
was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again,
it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, which
saith; ^says^ "The saints shall take the Kingom" &c "Again, "the Kingdom, and
the greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given to
the people, (the Saints) of the most High" &c And the Saints
here alluded to, were certainly Latterday Saints; was much, as the
above prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yet
future, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.
We have of late learned, that [[Warren Farr Parrish|pParish]], and the mostâ [rest] of this [2 illegible words], ^combination^
have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and becme deists.
[[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|I]] will now Leave [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and give you some acount of the move-
ment of things [[Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|here]], as they are and have been.
You, undoubtedly, will remember the visit, which I, in company with
Elder [[Elisha Hurd Groves|Groves]], made to the Churches in [[Kentucky|Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]], in
the summer of 1836. You also may reecollect, the nature and
result, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poor
bleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of the
Children of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundred
and fifty dollars, which we delivered unto [[William Wines Phelps|Wm Phelps]] & John
Whitmer, on our arrival to this place. But these men, instead
of laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleeding
Zion, purchased Land for their own emolument. They g^e^nerally
did their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^either^ the bishop
or High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author-
ities of Zion: not only because they purchased land With
Church funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement,
but because they selected the place of the City Far West
and appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to be
built on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed and
ordained a committee to build the same, without
asking or seeking council at the hand of either Bishop,
High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under-
stood that these authorities wer ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun-
ciling on all important matters pertaining to the saints of
God.
These two presidents also managed to get the town plott
into their own hands, that they that they might reap the avails
ariseing from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, with
many other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3rd day of
April 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishop
and his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W.
Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th inst. to which time they
adjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on theBrother W. Woo^d^ruff.
Sir, your Letter of the 9th of March, dire-
cted to Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]], Presidents Joseph Smith Jr, Sidney
Rigdon, ^and^ [[Hyrum Smith|Hyram Smith]], and the Saints in Zion, came safely to
them, some day's since. aAnd on account of the press of business
now on their hands, ^and the request of J Smiâth Jr,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it.
You say, that you have heard of the deplorable state of things in
Kirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, that
you viewed those things in their true light. Great has been the
afflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our beloved
Brotheren Joseph Smith Jr, and S. Rigdon.
In the past
summer; I Journeyed from this place in company with Wm
Smith, and [[David Wyman Patten|D. W. Patten]], to Kirtland, for the purpose of
meeting in conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival,
we soon learned the difeculties that then existed than: these
however wase all appearantly settled, preveious by to my leaving
Kirtland: And [[Warren Farr Parrish|^W^ Parish]], who has since become  so [3 illegible words] ^an unbeliever in the book^
^of Mormon, reveiled religion, [illegible],^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Joseph
and the Church. oOthers also did the same: But this settlement
was not of long duration. Soon after this, President Hyram
Smith and I, left Kirtland for the upper [[Missouri|Missouri]]: and
President Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ Wm
Smith, soon followed us to Far West: and during their
absence, it seemes that ^Wr^ Parish, [[John Farnham Boynton|J. F Bointon]], Luke
Johnson, [[Joseph Coe|Joseph Coe]], and some others, [illegible] ^united^ togeather in
for the [2 illegible words] ^repecting the procedings^ of the Church. President Smith and
his company returned on or about the 10th of December;
soon after which this [2 illegible words] ^decenting^ band, openly, and publickly,
renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed,
themselves to be the old standard, called themslves the Church
of Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught Br
Joseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks[[John Whitmer|John Whitmore]]

Dear Brother
Yours came to hand 8 or 10 days
since. I hope you will pordon me for not
writing sooner, for I feel that I have a just cause
to be excused. And this because of a multiplicity of
business.
The Hebrew School commenced this day, and I
hope that I shall be able to attend it some, but
out of necesity I will be excluded part of the
time because of the press of business.
You have no doubt an idea in regard to
the endowment and if you should suppose that
God intends to endow a man to destroy another
because he repents not, I would inform you that
your idea is incorrect, but I presume that you
have no such an idea. God will indow no
man except he has obtained wisdom and under-
standing enough to use power with discretion
and according to the will of God. I presume
the solemn assembly will take place in Febru-
ary if there will be no hinderance in the comple-
tion of the house.
I have written a letter to br [[Seth Willey|Seth [Willey]]], and
no doubt you have seen it ere this, had I
time I would write a long letter to you. But
I have not. And Elder [[Warren Farr Parrish|Parish]] wrote you and
you have the Bible Book of Mormon & Book of
Covenants these together with the Sipirit of God, will
will make you wise unto salvation, and give you
inteligence to lead others into the mansions of 
bliss. I am sensible that you feel your weekness
in the midst of a gainsaying and idolotrous generation
while in the days of your youth, and so for pain
your brethren ^the [prophets] &c^ But be not dismayed trust in God
and you shall not be confounded, for remember
what our Savior saith of the the Ravens, and of the
Lillies of the field, they toil not neither do they spin butconvincing & overwhelming.
II If we should exercise strong faith in GOD, and
live at the fountain head of holy influence
that isâshould we watch unto prayer, and 
pray without ceasingâshould we daily fear
to sin & daily deny ourselves & take up our
cross & follow christâshould all professors
of religion persue this courseâdoubtless a
wonderfull change would be effected at
once in the state of the church. but even
in that case I do not see that the church
would have any authority to attempt
to perform such miracles, as were performed
in the Apostolic age.
They doubtless would shed their holy
influence all around & be instrumen-
tal in the conversion of thousands of soulsâ
& the glorious Gospel would be spedily
be preached to all who dwell upon the
earth. For christians would feel that
all they possessed is christ's & they would 
most cheerfully devote themselves their
time, talents, property, privileges,
spirits, souls & bodyiesâ with their present
all & all they ever expectedâto the
service of their dear LORD & Master.
Let us pray fervently my dear brother, that
the LORD would hasten this glorious state of
the church.
Then will the deciples of Jesus be instrumen-
tal in performing as great or greater miracles
than did the Apostles.
As it respects your
III. Question. I would observe that it
is in my view, always desirable that those
who are baptized should join a churchâ an
evangelical Church. But I am ready to
baptize all persons who apply to me to 
administer that ordinanceâprovided they
give evidence of evangelical piety.
That the blessed saviour would direct
you alway & into all truth & finally bring
you to glory is the prayer of your
friend & brother.

George Phippin's answer to
Willford Woodruff
Jan 7th 1831III This is called the LORDs day.
The Psalmist in refference to the day on which Christ
arose & to the whole day of the Gospel dispensation 
saysâThis is the day which the LORD hath made
let us rejoice & be glad therein.
John the Revelator calls the first day the LORDs
day - Rev - 1 - 10.
IV The primitive christians met for public wor-
ship & made their collections for the poor on
the first day of the week. Acts 20. 7. Cor - 16.
They also met on the evening of the first day
of the ^week^ & their devine LORD repeatedly met
with them.
I close these remarks by observingâThat there
is an alarming laxness among christian pro-
fessors in keeping the christian Sabbath. & that
we might all awake to righteousness, on this
subject.
In answer to your second question ofn the 
subject of miraclesâI answer in general,
I. Miracles were wrought for a definite
purpose in the Apostolic ageâsummari
ly to establish the devine authenticity 
of the holy religion of the blessed Jesus.
That object has been accomplished. The evi
dence arising from miracles a lone, is clearThus it appears that the Sabbath was most sacredly re-
garded, before the moral law was given from Sinai.
But to mark the perpetual & universal obligation
of the observance of the Sabbath, GOD proclaimed the
law of it from Sinai [&] wrote it in a table of stone,
along with the rest which are allowed to be moral;
Exodus XX 8-11. Injunctions to keep it & threatenings for
the breach of it, are every where found in the law &
the prophets.
The Sabbath is therefore of universal obligation.
How is it changed from the seventh to the first day
of the week?
In answering this question I would observe
I. Man's moral obligation respects the seventh part
of his time, rather than any particular day.
It is not certain that the Godly before the flood, kept
the same day which they kept after that event.
Nor is it certain that the same cronology was obser-
ved at the giving of the law at Siniaâwhich had
been observed before & after the flood.
But however Cronology might alterâA seventh
part of the time would be the same in all ages.
II To honour his own ressurrection, Jesus the LORD
of the Sabbath, changed the Sabbath from the
seventh to the First day of the week.
To mark the devine authority of this change,
he on that day, made repeated visits to his de-
ciples - John XX. 19. 26. On that day he bestowed the mirac
ulous gifts & graces of the Holy Ghost - Acts II - 1.My dear Brother.
I have but little spare time,
But I will exppropriate these first few moments
which I have been able ^to^ catch from my num
erous callsâto answer your very interesting
questions! Let me say to you I am [please] you
took the liberty to propose them. I shall al-
ways be ready to listen to any similar re-
quests. But I hasten to my bussiness.
Your first question respects the Sabbath
& its change.
GOD having finished his work of Creation in six
days, ceased [and] rested therefrom on the seventh,
& set it apart for the more solemn worship of him
self by men. & as an emblem & pledge of their eternal
blessedness. Gen II 1. 2.
The ancient Patriarchs observed the Sabbath. though
we have no particular account of it.
The "End of days," when Cain & Abel offered their
oblations & The day when the sons of GOD met together
in Jobs time, doubtless were Sabbath days. Gen -IV. Job I - 6
& II. 1.
When GODs ancient people were fed with Manna from
Heaven, in the wilderness, they were told that a double
portion would fall on the day previous to the Sabbath
which should be gathered & that none should be gathered
on the sabbath for the Sabbath was the LORDs. Exodus. 16. 23[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|I]] have taken this method of speaking my mind because it seems
easier than verbal conversation. I have written already much more
than I expected, so I must bid you good bye [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Father]] & [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]] for the present

to her parents on leaving homeBeloved Parents â [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|I]] am now about to leave my parental
paternal roof for a while but I know not how long â but 
not without grateful feelings for the kindness which I
have received from my infancy untill the present time, â
but Providence seames to order it otherwise now than it has 
been. Let us commit all these things into the hands of 
Providence and be thankful that we have been permitted
to live togather so long under so favourable circumstances
as we have, believeing that all things will work for our good
if we love God supremely. Let us realize that we can
pray to one God which who will hear the sincere prayers of
all his creatures and give us that which is best for us.
May we strive to have that spirit in us that raised Christ 
from the dead that our mortal bodies may be quickened and
come forth in the morn of the first resurrection to reign with
Christ a thousand years where parting will be no more. 
Glorious thought may it ever stimulate us to be diligent in keeping
all the commands of God and not count our trials here too much to
gaine such a prize. [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]], I believe it is the will of God
for me to go to the the west and I have been convinced that it has been
for a long time. now the way has opened and you seem to be
reconciled to it which is the greatest conslattion to me of any
thing earthly; I believe that it is the spirit of the Lord that
has done it which is sufficient for all thing. O be not anx-
ious for your child the Lord will comfort me, I b^e^lieve that the Lord
will take care of me and give me that which is for the best. If it
is for the best for me to go there and lay down this body I think
I feel willing and what matter is it where this body lays untill
the resurrection when I hope and trust ^that^ we shall all rise Above
all the trials of this life. Let it not be to you as though I h^a^d done
some crime and was obliged to leave my home which would be far worse
if I know my hart I can say I go because my Master calls â he has 
made my duty plain; Believe not that all these things [a]re against you

Phippin by Willford Woodruff
Jan 1831& if I may be allowed to use the expression it has been a mysterey
to me how so many great divines that have been so long holding 
up the light of the gospel & still continue in so gross an error with
respect to babtism. for if I am not greatly mistaken I find no account
of John or any of the apostles administering the ordinance  of babtism
untill they become believers in Christ or at least untill they considered
them true believers & that appeared to be all that was required of them
in order to be babtized was to believe that Jesus Christ was the son
of God & if they spiritually believed this they must be penitent believers
& respecting the mode of babtism it appears plain to me that their is no
room for one a moment to doubt but that our saveiour was buried
in babtism in the river Jordan and that all that the Apostles babtized
ware buried with Christ in babtism & setting aside evry other example
but the one that Christ left us that alone ought to be sufficient
to convince mankind that emmersion was the rite & ownly mode
of babtism (to use the language of Dr Daddridge Jesus had no sin to
was[h] away & yet he was babtized and God owned this ordinance so far as to make
it a season of pouring forth the spirit uppon him & this ought to silence
evry objection to the practice)
many advance the argument
that those things are not escential but may we mot with the same
propriety say that when Abraham was called to offer his son Isaac
that it was not essential whether he offered his son or a lamb out
of his flock & who of [decided] virtue will admit that the Lord would
have received Abraham offering with a blessing & given a blessing in
return had he offered a lamb in stead of his son, & why should any believe
that infant sprinkling will be as acceptable in the sight of God for
babtism as to follow the example that our saveiour hath given
has not Christ plainly told us that he is the way ^the truth life^ & if mankind ever
enter in to the kingdom of heaven must it not be by him isf so
then ought we not to obey his commands and follow his precepts
& not climb up some other way.
Mr [[George Phippen|Phippen]] as I am
convinced of the mode of baptism, & believe it to be essential to
my prosperity & happiness the information that I wish you to communicate
to me respecting this subject is whether it is against your principle & discipline
to administer the ordinance of babtism to those that you consider to be
proper subjects without joining the Church for I at preasent am not
prepared to unite ^join^ with any church still I feel it a duty to be babtized
& would wish to take up the cross when I have a fair opportunity 
I have premeditated a conversation with you uppon this subject
but have delayed it as my brother is expecting to be babtized & I
have rather been waiting for him. sir I have ^not^ intended any harm
by asking those questions & I wish you to excuse all you see amiss in
my remarks & by answering me you will confer a great favour
uppon Willford Woodruffsecondly; with respect to the sabbath we allmost universally Regard
the first day of the week as the sabbath, but when God appeared
to Moses on the mount he commanded him to keep the seventh
day as the sabbath & not to labour on that day, so it appears that 
if their has mot been a change of the sabbath we as a body are not
keeping the day that we ware commanded to keep still it is held up
to view at this day that the sabbath has been changed, but is it mot
allowed that their has mot been no change in any of those commands
that were given to Moses at the time that the command of the bsabbath was
given & why has the sabbath been changed while the other commands
remain good & sacred & while we are under them & ought to obey them
it is maintained ^by some^ that Christ rose on the first day of the week & that
the work of Redempttion was greater than the work of creation & this they
appear to consider as the change of the sabbath, but when we carefully
peruse the writings of the four Evangelist respecting the resurrection of
Christ does it not appear as reasonable to suppose that Christ rose on
the seventh day as first, & even did Christ really rise on the first
day of the week does that prove that it was a change of the sabbath
& if the sabbath was changed by the resurrection of Christ would their
mot have been sumthing said respecting that change so that the
evidence would have been clear that the change of the sabbath was
then perfected. [[George Phippen|sir]] this is a subject that has some length of time
ocipied a seat in my mind & I lay it before you considering you
have far deeper understanding of the word of God than myself & would
wish to know your views uppon this subject as I have not understood
the scriptures to be verry plain respecting the change of the Sabbath
the third & last is the subject of
babtism & it is a subject to that has long lain with wait on
my mind I think it not ownly our duty but our highest privledge
to take the word of God & make it the man of our council & form
our principles theirby still we may benefit by the instruction of
those that are more experianced than ourselves I for one Consider
myself transacting business for Eternity & I believe that Jesus Christ
sat the example for the pilgrain to follow & I believe that the christian
ought to strive to imitate his example as near as possible (allthough
I for one come far short of it) I at times have been allmost
overwhelmed in as^s^tonishment while meditating uppon the difference
of opinion & principle that exist in our land uppon religious subjects
when we have all the sane bible to read the same spirit to direct
but more especially uppon the subject of babtism. my mind has
long been [seleled] with regard to this subject still I have remained
silent uppon the subject as I am of the opinion that evry person ought to
be fully established uppon ^in^ principles uppon which much depends
I had the ordanonce of infant babtism administered to me but it does
not answer my mind for I have not found any scripture to support
it from genesis to revelationMr. [[George Phippen|Phippen]]
Sir believing you to be familliar with the word
of God & considering you willing to instruct your inferiors uppon
spiritual subjects, & after forming such conections of your character
I take this method to ask ^you^ several questions for information &
instructions as I have no other motive in view, & should you
not consider it beneath your notice to answer my questions
by writing but give me your opinion as you have formed it
from the word of God it would be highly intresing to me
[illegible] 1[ts] is respecting the gifts that were in the ancient church the gift of
healing the sick raising the dead casting out devils &c.
2th the Sabbath & its changes.
3th & last is the subject of babtism. Firstly, while perusing
the sacred volumen of inspiration I find many wonderful works
were performed by our Saveiour and likewise by the apostles though not
by their own power but by faith in & through Jesus Christ
& if I mistake mot when Christ first sent his disciples to preach
the gospel which was to the lost sheep of the house of israel he commanded
them to heal the sick cleanse the lepers rase the dead cast out devils &c
S. Mathew. chap. X again in the last chapter of S. Mark Christ appeared to
the eleven as they sat at meat & gave them a varry forcible command
to go into all the world & preach the gospel to ev^e^ry creature he that
believeth & is baptized shall be saved & he that believeth not shall
be damned & these signs shall follow them that believe in my name
shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues
they shall lay hands on the sick & they shall recover &c this apparently
was the last command given by our saveiour before he assended to
heaven. now the question that arises in my mind is when & whare
were those gifts done away as some maintain that they are. I find
no scripture satisfactory to prove that they ever were done away
theirfore I am led to believe that God is the same to day as in ancient
days & likewise should people at this day live as did the apostles & exercise
the faith that did Abraham in offering up his son Isacc that those gifts
might again be on the earth and in case of sickness we might
loock to the Lord for deliverance in prefference of trusting to an arm of
flesh. we read of a woman that was ill that had suffered many things
of many Physicians & had spent all that she had & was nothing better but
rather grew worse which was finally healed by her faith in Christ.
should light be held up to the world uppon this subject at the preasent
day undouptedly their would be as little heed given to it as the Lord
told Ezekiel their would be to his prophecy when he sent him to the house
of israel, yet I ask your opinion uppon the subject for information
(the Lord sent Ezekiel to prophecy mowithstanding they would not hear
& ought not light uppon this subject be held up even if it is not received)would not suffer materially if they did not get
a Territorial Government immediately or something to
that Effect. I am of his opinion I think so to [&]
think it would be a good plan to take his adv[i]se
& withdraw the petition! If we want a Territorial
Gove[rnmen]t we can call for it another session
If we want a State Govern[men]t we will be in
also be in a situation to apply for it if we are
not confined under a Territorial.
Thus you have my views & I pray God to sustain
& uphold you & lead you right.
Mr [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Babbitt]] informed me in his last that if
th[e]y gave us a Territorial Govern[men]t at all
they would send Pharaohs to rule over us. I have

to [[John Milton Bernhisel|J. M. Bernhisel]]
March 26th 1850
[[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgepot]] Mass
Mach 26th 1850
Brother Bernhisel
Dear Sir
I receved your interesting Letter
of the 22nd intat and nothing but a croud of businss has
prevented me from you upon the subjet of which
you speak even befoe I receved yours. I was privileged
with the company of professor [[Orson Pratt|O. pratt]] [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] & J B.
Wallace on the Sabbath & I convrsed freely with those
Brethn upon the Subject & I find but one spirit & opinion
prevailing amog us & that is, it is far better to withdraw
the petition for the present untill you can consult
your constituents than to receive a Territorial Gove[rnmen]t
with Military polititions sent unto our midst to tyronize
[ovr] us who has no interest in our welfare it is my
firm conviction that the Citizens of [[Utah Territory|Deserett]] will sustain
you in withdrawing your petition for the time being
rather ^than^ to receive a Terratorial Gov[ernmen]t with the spirit
of restrictions that the present Congress manifest
in disposition to lay upon us. Yes Brothe Bernhisel
watch well the signs of the times in this matter do
not let a n[e]t be flung [ovr] the people of Deserett
to their inquiry they should have the rights of Citizenship
as well as other people. The president has recomede[n]d
in his speach a thought that the people of the [[Utah Territory|Basin]]from Him of any kind, and that mostly cncing [concerning] a [poer] of Attorny
to collet some mo[ne]y for some powers in [[Iowa|Iowey]]. Yet notwâhstâdâ
all this I have not for a momet suffered the spirit of prejudice
or Jealousy to take root in my heart agaist him as though 
He was neglecting me or was not interestaed in my welfare 
or prosperity, or equally ingaged in the same Common 
cause with myself, and I have not felt in the least [to]
[imparte] it to any other cause ownly that He was overwhelmed
in busness & cares.  I am aware there from conversation
with yourself & public papers, that [there] had been a ^former^ differenc 
betwng you & Mr. [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] But since that He has pub[lis]hed
throgh the [[Frontier Guardian|Guadian]] that it was all made up & [settletled] & 
I had no idea but that you were on the best of terms
But to sum up the whole matter ^of this subjet^ my views are those
That the cause ^in which^ you are ingaged in is of Equal interest to 
yourself, Dr [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]], Mr Hyde, myself,  and evy good man
who expets to become a Citizen of the State of Deseret, and I 
consider that any man who has any different veiws of this subjet 
has a wrong one. Men may differn in politics, I nevr cast
any other vote at the poles in my life, even my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] before me 
that I werehve any knowledge of, except a Democrat vote, still & 
consider our petition to Congress for a Goverment for Deseret
a vary differet thing from party politics, I consider it are
common cause for all the inhabitants of that Stat whether
[thy] [they] be wDemocrats Whigs or Free soil and I consider any
lawful or legarl influenc extented to eventually give Deseret a 
State Gvement to be of interest & worth to her inhabitats let it 
eminate from what party it may. This I have given you 
my views concering thesee points in your letter that needed explanatin
as feel as I am enabled to do in a communcatin of this ki[n]d a[n]d
I hope it will be satisfactory as far as I am conceed [concerned]. have writtenthe Dr ^[[John Milton Bernhisel|Berhisel]]^ Since my return Home.  I Haven got
recieved a letter from him to day by the same mail that
Brought yours. As to ^the^ accusations against me in the phrasologey 
of wanton Neglect in not writing you is an accusation that I shall 
not recieve for I am not guilty, in in that sense of the word
and I think friends ought to study each othrs Circumstnces
sufficiently at least to lay a fondatiun for reasonable excuses
whae their is any seeming neglect towards us before we acâee
them to strongly. I wrote you a letter to lay the fondation for 
a Correspondane you answered it and the following is your closing
remak "I will keep you informed of all matters & things transpiring here
as touching our common Interest," that letter it is true I did
not answer." In this it may hve appeared to you a [seemg]
neglect, still I do not think from that circustanc you 
are warranted in taking the strong grounds in which you accuse 
me, for in reality I did not intend any neglect whatevâe
for as I hve already explaned I thoght one Com[mun]icati[o]n 
every Western officers ^upon the subjet which I wrote^ would answer for both this in 
Connexion with my being overwhelmed is business was the
ownly reasn why I did not write to both, and agn 
frm your last sentanc I judged that I should hve reced [received]
anoth letter from you before long. So much I hve [said]
for myself, As conceing Mr [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] I have ownly to say 
that I have no knowledge concing am [any] instructions He may 
have recieved from the presidency concing your mission 
or any othe Subject any further than what is made public 
through the prress. For although I hve been travelling in this 
Easten Contry a[mon]g the Chches, for near two years & sent
him many ^a dozen or more^ letters, containg some 60 or 70 subscribers for the [[Frontier Guardian|Guadan]]
yet I have [never] as I recollet recved but two commdâtesinstead of finding rest I fo[u]nd a vary large nuber of 
lying before me some 25 ^[many]^ letters from vari[ou]s parts of the world
among them was one from Dr [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] & one from yourself. I 
also had rec[eiv]ed among othr thgs an Epistle from the valley
& Letters from the presidency ^in [[Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|the valley]]^ requiring certain things [of] ^me^ my hads 
which required me to correspod with the Ch[ur]ches which 
I have to do by lettr writing as I have No other way of Communi 
cation with them, and Hence I need to write some 50 Letters & mail
last Week and am[on]g [thous] I sent one ^one of that [nuber] I sent^ to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] which I 
happened to write and address to Dr. Bernhisel instead of yourself 
as I had Nothing to communicate except what was from the 
valley & that I expeted you would both receve before mine
woud arive in the form of a visit from Messers [[Joseph Leland Heywood|Haywood]] & [[Edwin Dilworth Woolley|Wooley]]
or by the Epistle, still lest you should not receve it I [send]
it in [my] letter to Dr. Bernhisel, and if ^my^ I had had time 
^had permtted^ I should have ansued both letters, or if I had known that 
or even th[ou]ght that it would have made any difference in 
your feelings, or that you ^[consdered] you^ was slighted I certainly should 
have add[r]essed you instead of him, But such a thought 
neer entered my mind. In addressing him or if I had addessed
you upon that subject it would have been the came with me for I 
should have Had no othr thought but that one comunicatin to 
either of you Concning any News from the valley would have been 
Communictated to equally to both, for I had the not the most
distant idea but what you were haveing a free exchange of views & 
sentim[en]ts, in a sotcial manner, almost daily, for the Dr Berhisel had
neer hinted any idea contrary to it in any communcation to me. I 
wrote to the Dr as We had spent Considerable time in social con-
versation upon a variety of subjects, ^just previous to his going to Washington^ & I should liked to have enjoyed
the came privilege with your self, that is the ownly lettr I[sideways text]

Dear Sir
Yours of Jan 16th has just come to hand and I
must Confess that I am much surprised at its contents and 
do not understand it. and I feel think it needs some wisdom
to answer such letters in a right & proper manner lest misun-
derstanding arise of an unpleasant nature between men who are 
endeavoring to bring to pass the same object. It it's is also often more 
difficult to explain many matters and things by Letter writing than it
is in personal Conversation, However I will venture to come to the subjet 
you say you have not recieved a letter from "any one haveing influenc
in the Ch[ur]ch" "Or from any leading men in the Chuch" Now I may
not be a proper judge what amount of influence I may have in the Ch[ur]ch
Still I believe I have some and have endeoved [endeavored] to use that influenc for 
the general good of the whole to the best of my ability" I write you
a letter by Dr [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] who was going Direct to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] to cooperate
(as I supposed) with you) for the vary purpose of laying a foudations to Correspond
with you. The following was the closing remarks "I should essteem it 
a great favor to meet in council with you & Dr. Bernhisel at Washington 
but do not now expet to have the oppertunity" I should take it as a 
faver if you would write to me occasinally and infore me of your 
progress & prospets" This letter you recieved. On my I also 
addressed a short note to you while at [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] as a Letter of
introduction of Mr [[George Copway|Copway]] who was expeting to go [Soon] to Washington

Dear Sir
I have just ar[ri]ved in this
City & obtained your Letters, you will of course 
follow the instructions you have recved from Head
quarters if you fail in a State & go in for a Territory 
as the last resort I think that every exhertion in any 
power should be made to get our own officers elected
say [[Brigham Young|Brigham Youg]] [illegible] Governor & go down according to theirs 
appointment as far as possible a I recved a Note from Col [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]]
this evening who are from Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] who informed me 
that the Letters from Mr [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter]] to the [[Maine|Maine]] members was
sent to me at [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] and was immediately forwaded 
on to you at [[Washington, D.C., United States|washington]] which I trust you have got 
Mr Carter informs me that the Maine Members have 
promissed to do all they can for us connstantly &c which I 
think will be a help to you. My family are all well 
I am also. I had a meeting n[i]ght before last in [[Hornerstown, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Horne[rs]town]]

Dear Sir

the evening I ^last^ saw you also sent him another the next 
day requsting him to take the word Territory out of the 
petition before it was presented at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]
also remarked that I would rather the bill would 
be withdrawn than to recieve a Territory unless we 
had the fullest assureance given us by the presidet
that officers of our own choice wshould be appointed 
Dr Bernhisel informs me that they are instructed
to ask for a Territory if they cannot get a State 
then as a last resort if the State fails we must use 
every possible exhertion to get our own officers appoited 
and trust the event in the hands of God. I shall write Dr 
Bernhisel immediately. I will say I have been enabled to 
procure letters of recommendation for Dr Bernhisel to 
the Senators and Representatives from the State of [[Maine|Maine]] 
who have promised to [go] for our cause
That peace Health, Strength and prosperity may attend 
you is the cincere prayer of yours Truly

prayer day by day and prayed for your success & prosperity in the glorious
cause ^in which^ your are engaged in, also for Dr. [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] believing that you both
[was] doing your best to exhert an influence if not with the same
individuals that it was all lending to the same cause & to produce
the same effects and I will furthermore say that I will ^not ownly^ continue to
pray for your success, But I feel to sustan you with evry feeling
& sentimnt of my heart evy way in my power in accomplishing the
object of your mission ^at^to Washington, and I will endeavor to do
the same for evey agent who goes forth for the benefit of [[Utah Territory|Deseret]]

Brother [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]]
Dear Sir
I sent you a few lines last night ^eveneg^
written in great Haste, as the boat was about to start but one item
which I intended to have mentioned was omitted which I con
sider quite essential and which I did not think to mention when I
saw you.  If I mistake not the petition to which the signers names
are attached calls for a Territorial Governmnet if that is the case it
appeares to me that that petition should not be presnted befoe
Congress by any means untill it is altered I think that wise
policy would dictate that the word Territory be not so much as
once named in any petition or address which you have to
lay before congress in the request which is now made at there
hands, but State and State alone the ownly thing we ask for
and with my present feelings I pray to God with all my heart
that sooner than to have a Territorial Govenment given us that
they may not be permitted to give us any ^a^ Govement at all unless
by all means we could have our own Govenor & other offcers
which is a vary uncertain matter, if we could not get a State
would it not be better to withdraw the bill or petitions as
we afterwards could again present a petition for a state while
if we were a Territory we could not do it perhaps for many
years besides all the trouble that would arise from Haveing
officers & polititions among us who would have no interest in our
wilfare I throw these things [out] as they rest upon my mind
for your consideratin this subject is increasing upon my mind
and rests with wait upon me more & more day & night & is uppermost
above all other considerations and I do not know but I feel as much
interested in it as though the whole concern rested upon my shouldiers

I called Satudy & Mondy
at your Office to see you a few mom[en]ts I leave
this afternoon for [[New York|New York]].  The subject I wished to
save a few words upon was this I have discovered of late
occasinally a threat made by the Editors of the various
Journals aganst the inhabitants of the State of Deserett
conveying an idea that they are vary Hostile to the Gov[e]r[nme]nt
& that th[e]y take up & try men for being engaged in
the Missoure war or but I wish it to be distictly
understood that all these things are composed & put forth
at this critical time for political effect in order to
preijudice the public mind & govnmet against us, d[u]ring this
session of congress supposing that the Citizens of Deseret are
at to great a distance to contradict Such any statemnt that
made may be made. and this is the ownly true light
in which such reports should be [considered] let them
eminate from whatever source they may for the Citizens
of Deseret have manifested their attachmet to the govmet &
Constitution of [illegible] Coutry by leaving their families

Dear Sir
In my reflections I have thought
there might be some dubiety resting upon your mind
in regard to the views of the inhabitants of the State
of Deseret upon the subject of Slavery in consequece 
of their not introducing a clause in there State Constitu-
tion prohibiting Slavery. I think your interesting
visits in our midsts, your travels in our encampments,
your clame of observations in our families Assem-
blies & Councils whare the sentiments of our hearts have
been freely poured out before you must all combine
to convince you that the inhabitants of the State of
Deseret will never sustain in any [wise] the institution
of Slavery in their midst. We are a peaceful and
industrious people have removed to the sequestered vally
of the Great Salt Lake. we do not wish to have anythg
to do with the "vexed question of Slavery" or any of the
other exciting political questions and therefore we deemed
it expedient not to introduce a clause into our
Constitution prohibiting the introduction of Slaves into
the State of Deseret but Slavery can never be
Tolerated there

The deep interest I feel at 
heart for the general good interest & welfare of the inhabitants 
of the State of Deserett at this critical & important crises

this time to address you by Letter. as I may not have a 
per[s]onal interview with you which I should be vary glad
to have befoe your arival at Congress [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] 
or our petition is presented before Congress, I wish to 
suggess present a few items for your consideration. In the 
first place I will ^wish to^ say I have not been Idle since I learned
that the inhabitants of the vally had organized a State Governtment 
& that you was their delegate to Washington but I 
have endeavored to do all in my power to assist the cause
in any way that I could, and I am fully convinced
from what I have learned from various sources & classes
that a most judicious, wise, discreet & prudent cource must 
be carried out in this affair in order to secure success
I also firmly believe that you ought not to commit
yourself in the least by taking sides with the democrats
whigs, Free Soil, or any ^othr^ party for by so doing at the comm[encem]ent
of the service I belive it would be certain death, to your 
success but take a Neutral groud at first & watch the signs
of the times & then act according to circustances you will

I wonder If I could not have a few words from

the letter from [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|my wife]]. It was truly a trial to her to loose
her little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|girl]] so sudden & that to in my absence but she
bears it vary well, & feels quite resigned it gave me a sudde[n]
shock when I first saw it in Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]] letter but it was but
for a moment. I felt much resigned to it. I have written my
wife a long letter which I sent her yesterday. I was glad to
hear that you & [[Heber John Richards|Heber John]] was comfortable I hope the
Lord will spare your life & the lad to see good days. Sister

little girl, & Brother [[Albert Petty|Petty]] seems to think that the Missourians
are much troubled about the 50 men going up to make a
new Settlement. He sayes Gov[r] [[Thomas Carlin|Carlin]] has made a demand
of Gov [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]] of our Brother that was kidnaped & says he will cary
it to the fullest extent of the Law. Brother Petty thinks it will
make some disturbance between [[Illinois|Illinois]] & [[Missouri|Missouri]] But
I say go ahead. I dreamed my child was dead on the
night of the 18th of July the day after it was buried. I dreamed
a few nights ago of ketching a great mess of large fish & I
thought Brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel Woodruff]] who has Been dead 2 years
came & helped me, the next night I dreamed of ketching
& rosting clams out of the sea the next night I dreamed snakes came

Beloved Brother
Your kind Letter & Â£1 post order
came to hand in good Season & in a time of need without
which we could not have paid our Bills last night
As we have had to pay for our board, lodgings, room, fire,
candles, Washing, preaching room, printing Bills, letter postage,
&c. &c. it has taken away our money & as the Saints have
not been able to help us at all here it has fallen upon our
sholdiers alone, there is beginning to be some inquiry into
our doctrin in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] at least the people are begining to call
for the Stars & Books &c. & there is a peace in the yesterday
London Times against us taken from the Leeds Paper so I hope that
will set the people to inquiring about us, there are some persons
in the Streets that pull down our hand Bills so that people
will not see them, for some cause or other the devil is
dreadful fraid the work will get set up in London. I wish
we had a few copies of the voice of Warning which I think would
do good to be put into the hands of s[o]me inquiring minds
I know not what will be done here in London, it seems
to be rather slow making a Start, it is sumthing as it was 
in [[Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland|Edinburgh]] We cannot get many of the people out to hear
But yet we do not feel all at all discouraged about the
matter the work is in the hands of God, & we leave it with him
We mean to do the Best we can. I dont know what the
day will bring forth we have a meeting this afternoon &
Evening. It seems Brother [[Orson Pratt|Orson pratt]] is begining to do well
in Edinburgh & I am glad to hear it he thinks of Spending
the winter there unless the Lord Orders otherwisewhich will prove a savior of life unto life or of Death unto Death not ownly unto 
them, but unto all they unto whom the sound thereof shall come, even of the whole 
gentile world & the judgment of the great day shall manifest the truth of it unto all 
nations. And it will ever sweeten the memory of that eventful period of my life 
to know that our labours on that occasion were not in vain. But that we were 
enabled through the great mercy & goodness of God & toil, labour, dilligent search, & 
perseverance, to find some of the Blood of Ephraim, a few honest souls that were 
willing to recieve & obey the gospel & that we were enabled to lay the foundation 
of a work in that [[London, Middlesex, England|City]] which will not be removed untill the City is warned so that 
they will be left without excuse, & the saints gathered out to stand in Holy places 
while judgment works. Untill that time the seed which we have sown in that 
city & that which you are now sowing shall bring forth fruit & the fruit 
shall remain to the honour & glory of God & I say it in the name of 
Jesus Christ & the Spirit Beareth record & the record is true. Therefore 
Brethren let your souls rejoice, & your hearts be made glad, that we are permitted 
to bear some humble part in the sacrafices, sufferings, & reproach of Christ & of 
warning this generation & of gathering together the honest in heart & the meek
of the Earth that they with us may stand together in Holy places while judgement 
works ^works^, & be prepared to enter into that rest which remaineth for the People of 
God. And Dear Brethren my prayer to God is that we may ever be meek & humble 
that the Power of the Priesthood & the spirit of our ministry & mission may rest upon 
us that we may be carried through evry strait Place wherein we are called to walk that
we may keep the faith & overcome the world. I pray my heavenly Father in the name of 
Jesus Christ that this may be our happy lot & that we, with all the Elders of Israel, & Saints
of God may be prepared to joyfully meet our Lord & Master when he appeareth again the second 
time without sin unto salvation.
Thus Testifieth your Brother in the Everlasting Covenant

ball & [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] 
Sept 12th 1840occupied by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, & his Highness Prince Albert, except while they
are at [[Windsor Castle, Windsor, Berkshire, England|Winser Castle]]. [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]] Covers a number of acres of ground & is surro
unded by a high wall of hewn stone except the front which is a high fence of cast Iron
railing, & evry door, enterence, & gate was strongly guarded by armed soldiers. I walked 
nearly around this castle Palace, & while there I for the first time had a view of his 
Royal Highness Prince Albert while he was riding from his palace across [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St James Park]]
mounted upon a gray horse accompanied ownly by his groom who was riding a sorrel horse.
I also spent a few moments in the [[National Gallery, Westminster, Middlesex, England|National gallery]] which was ^is^ not unprofitable to a traveller
desiring to form a knowledge of countries & the art of man. This gallery contains a vary 
great & extensive variety of the most Perfect Paintings that could be gathered together 
by the Nation, these with other things we have had the privilege of forming a 
knowledge of for ourselves. ^But^ Brethren while you discover that I hav written rather 
largely concerning these temporal & perishable objects which are in the same state, & doomed to 
share the same fate in the revolutions of the last days & the fall of Babylon, as Jerrusalem
did when they rejected their king & put to death the Messiah, think not that I for a moment
harbour the idea that the ownly benefit we have derived in the enjoyment of our late 
mission together in the City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] has been a knowledge of these things, far from this.
for while I have spoken of these things while they were in memory more for the purpose
of preserving a historical sketch of the same than other wise, still the remaining part of 
the subject rest upon my mind with greater weaight. Yes Brethren our late mission together 
has not ownly put us in possession of a knowledge of those things spoken of but it hath 
given us a more intimate acquaintance with each other & that to in some degree in the midst
of trials, which acquaintance has had a tendancy if possible to unite our hearts
more closer together in the love of God & the New & Everlasting Covenant. this is 
not all. we have stood together in this first mission to the city of London in which 
we have had the privilege of uniting our labours in lifting up the standard of truth, of 
light, & the fulness of the everlasting gospel, & When on dilligent search we found the whole 
city given to Idolitry, Priescraft, tradition, superstition, & all manner of abominations wick-
edness, & uncleanness & all doors closed against us we did not hesitate to stand in 
the midst of the streets & Jonah like cry repentance unto the Inhabitants of that mighty 
city, The Metropolis of [[England|England]], the Pride & glory of [[Great Britain|Britain]], the Boast of the Gentiles & the
largest city in the world, containing one million five hundred thousand souls who were 
ripened in iniquity, &prepared for the wrath of God, & like the ox going to the slaughter 
know not the day of their visitation. Yes Brethren I shall long remember standing in 
the midst of that people & assisting you in bearing a message unto them, a messageâ Viz 1. St. Benedict. 2. St. Edmund. 3. St. Nicholas. 4. Henry the Seventh. 5. St. Paul.

deposited in vaults in this [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Abbey]] & Monuments erected to their memory. Here we had the privilege
of viewing the full stature & perfect likeness of Queen Elizabeth, Mary, & Anne 
Lord Nelson, & Pitt & others. We saw the full Coronation Dress of Queen Anne. We 
also saw the chair & sat in it, in which Queen Victoria was crowned & all the Kings 
& Queens in [[England|England]] for the last 800 years this chair is covered with gold tissue. It 
contains a stone under the seat upon which all the Scottish Chiefs, & Kings were crowned 
since they were a people it is reported to be Jacobs Pillar which chair has been in use 800
years. In walking through this Abbey we see frequent marks of violence from Oliver Cromwell
in defacing some of the tombs, monuments, & brass work with which some of the Abbey was 
adorned. Here we behold the art of man with all its combined force & power spun to the 
finest thread, & expanded to the fullest extent in the building & finishing of this Abbey as 
a general whole, But more esspecially that part called Henry Sephenth Seventh's Chapel
& a visit to this Abbey is not ownly worthy of the Attention of all travellers but to occupy 
a place in the Journal of any Historian.
While speaking upon this subject I would 
not pass over our visit to the [[Palace of Westminster, Westminster, Middlesex, England|house of Parliment]], on the 8th of Sept. As we entered the 
house of Lords (now occupied as the house of Commons) ^we did not behold^ so much to interest the sight of the eye as 
the meditation of the mind, however we had the privilege of resting ourselves by siting in the chair in 
which the speaker of the house of Lords had sat for many years. In this room all the speeches were 
made by Mr William Pitt while advocating the American cause, before the Revolution. In this room
all the laws were made that now governs ^from^ 175 to 200 000 000 of human beings. As the house of 
commons was burned down about six years since this room at the present time is occupied by ^for^ the 
house of commons & there is another house now built which the house of Lords at the 
present time occupies. One would naturly suppose that a house of Parliament fitted up to 
contained Kings, Lords, & Commons would be sumthing extra, grand, & expensive but we found 
it quite the reverse. It is excedingly plain & undecorated. On entering the room one would 
sooner think he was in an American school house rather than in a house of Lords or of Commons.
While retiring from this scenery we had a view of the order of British soldiery or foot guards
while on parade in [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St James' Park]], accompanied by a full band of music. Also of the Queens 
Horse guard 100 in number well mounted upon fat gay black mares, & the steel with which 
their bodies were covered glistening in the Sun. We might make mention of the monument
erected in honour to his grace the Duke of York which was 135 feet in highth & of the 
mansion of Queen Dowager widow of the Late King Williams IV which we had a 
view of as we past along. In fine St James Park is surrounded as it were with Dwellings
mansions, castles, monuments, & Palaces, of the first class as to size, splendour, & Note of any in 
Europe, of which [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]] is the Chief. this is for the Royal Family & is now [[Leigh, Gloucestershire, England|Leigh]], Gloucestershire, England. Sept 12th, 1840.
Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] & [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]].
Beloved Brethern,
I am in the midst 
of the saints at the Leigh enjoying good health & spirits. & while 
meditating upon the scenes which have transpired with me during the 
last 23 days which has been spent with you on a mission in the 
City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]], I feel disposed to pen a few of my thoughts on paper for your 
perusal. Brethren this is the first mission we have ever enjoyed together in the vineyard. Can 
we for a moment say that our time hath been spent in vain during this period? Nay we cannot 
the spirit within me forbids it. Have we not profited by this school of experianc? yea much 
evry way. While the Lord hath manifested by revelation that it is his will that we should obtain a 
knowledge of Kindgdoms & countries, this mission hath placed us in a situation to avail our- 
selves of the desired information upon many things that which we could not otherwise
have obtained. Time will clearly show that the late mission which we have enjoyed together
in the City of London (which is still continued by your labours) will ever be firmly engraved 
in our minds & occupy an important place, In the history of our travels among the 
Nations of the Earth. When London feels the chastning hand of the ALMIGHTY 
& in her turn amid the revolutions of the gentile world finds her doom is sealed with her
lofty spires, synagogues, mansion, & pallaces, laid in one common ruin, then with what feelings
shall we address our children or the thousands that may surround us, while our heads
are blossoming with age, as we point to the 21st day of September ^october Aug^ 1840, when we 
stood together upon the top of the most splended & highest modern pillar in the Univers &
with the naked eye surveyed the most populous & wealthy city upon the face of the 
earth, which we can then exclaim hath been the theater of much misry & wo, but now sleeps
in death. We ^having in my possessin a history of places visited I feel disposed to give the same {that [and may he] give} a correct {account of} the {same} to refer to^ shall not readily forget ^on the 24th oct we visited^ Oct [Aug] 24th while we walked to & fro through St
Pauls Cathedral which was 500 feet in length 285 in bredth 404 in highth which was 40 years
in building from 1675 to 1715 which cost Â£136000 or $3,680,000 ^Â£l,567,076,15. $ 5880,380^ which contains 
47 monuments of fine marble erected over the Tombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals 
Earls & other titles who had distinguished themselves in the military service of Great Brit-
ian & otherwise, Lord Nelsons being the most noted, & while historians have taken much 
interest in the origen of this cathedral dedicated St Paul which was first built by St
Augustine in the year 610, & now considered the largest cathedral in the world excepting 
the [[Vatian|Vatican, Rome, Lazio, Papal States]] at Rome dedicated to St Peter. We ^ourselves^ can clearly see the gentiles are zealous in 
a form of Godliness while they deny the power thereof, for while this church stands in 
honor to St Paul, those who whorship therein utterly reject & deny the principles which 
he tought. Again I think we shall not doubt the words of Soloman when he said man had 
sought ought many inventions esspecially when we reflect back to the 1st day of Sept, when 
We desended together about 40 feet into the Bowels of the earth & walked throught the Thames
Tunnel with the [[River Thames, England|River Thames]] & British shiping over our heads which was opening a thorough 
fare from one shore to the other which was finished 1110 ^feet^ & was lighted with gas, arched 
overhead & considered one of the greatest wonders of the last days. The time we spent 
together on the 5th of Sept Visiting [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]] was not unprofitable, had we 
travled the world oer we could not have found another spot that would have pre-
sented a wider field of knowledge & of contemplation as touching the history of the 
rise, progress, & fall of Kings, Princes Lords & mighty men of Gentile greatness pride 
& boast. This Abbey was composed of eleven Chapels (ownly seperated by walls or petitions)Mr [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]

Paid Answred March 3rdto shelter her sins behind. Again the principle of finding fault with a
Brother & or Sister & speaking evil of them behind their backs as a sin that
God hates & if it is not repented of it will bring the curse of God upon
the heads of those that are thus guilty. & I believe their is eviel of this
kind in [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], & their are those in preston that have wrongly accused &
had evil surmisings both towards you & Sister [[Jennetta Richards Richards|Richards]] & if they do
not scease from those things & spedaly repent their wickedness shall be
manifest & their eniquity brought to light & they will feel the chastning
hand of God, & I say it in the name of Jesus christ. I know
it is difficult to deal with such cases whare they are all pointed towa
rds ones own self, but I am more & more convinced & that to
by the spirit of God, that the church Will never prosper in preston untill
they treat you in a different manner from what they are doing at least
many of them, they ought to sympathize with you in your afflicti[on]
& assist you to the necessaries of life, & uphold you by love, confidence
pray[er] & faith, it is what God requires at their hand. [[Willard Richards|Brother]] & Sister
Richards dont be discouraged, the Lord will give you the victory, you
shall overcome & your Enemies shall not prevail against you, I 
will plead with God for you, you shall have my prayers if I can
do nothing more. I would say in all cases of Church dealing it
would be well to persue the gospel course & it appears that you have done
& leave the event in the hands of God. & let us ask God for wisdom &
he will give it unto us. My Love to Sister Richards & all who
inquire a letter from you will meet a welcome reception at
any time Dont trouble yourself about the postage it is but a trifle I
I will pay it. excuse the hasty scribling of this sheet. That health, strength,
faith, grace, & evry needful thing may rest upon you from God our
Father & our Lord Jesus christ is the prayer of your Brother in the Love of God
W. Richards W Woodruffsome excitement & things are working about right now in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|potteries]]
to have the people hear the word whether they embrace it or not, the priest
are quite mad because we are getting a hold in [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] we have
a good house to preach in & we have a worthy brother who has rece
ived the work & his doors are opened unto us constantly. he is a Merc-
hant in the place his wife & servent are also members of the Church
We shall have warm opposition in Hanly for it is the seat of
iniquity & pristcraft but the Lord is with us. I preach on the mor
row Sunday in [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] & [[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]] Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Corden]] in Hanly. I receved
a letter from Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] on Thursday he was in [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]
preaching to his relatives in the family circle. but was soon expecting
to preach in public. he foud hard work to preach to his parents who
had been professors of Godliness 40 years & had great confidence in
their ministers. Brother [[Henry Glover|H. Glover]] has just returned on a visit to
his friends about 50 miles & some rage & fight otherers want the word
& some wish to be Baptzed. But I will close about matters with
us
Now Dear [[Willard Richards|Brother]] with respect to your Difficulty that you spoke of
I will acknowledge I have not had time to meditate upon it & pray about it
as much as I could wish but yet the spirit of God knows all things I
am sensible you have many difficulty things to encounter. I do not
know what better you could have done than the course you have persued con
sidering all circumstances, but one thing is certain sumbody is much
out of the way. In the first place I ask in the name of reason & Revelation
that if Sister D is sick what business Sister C or any other person has to accuse
her of feigning herself sick, the principle is of the Devil & the spirit of God bears
record against it. If Sister C had charity & the Love of God in her soul & was

in answer to yours. perhaps you may think that I have not had
time to consider upon your request on your last page sufficient
to express my opinion upon it, but one cause I have for writing
without delay is to inform you of the contents of Brother [[Hiram Clark, b. 1795|Clarks]]
letter which you mailed to him, But perhaps you may have had
it before you will re[c]ieve my Letter He sayes Brothers [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] & [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]]

of Mormon the Lord showed it to me & I preached to them upon the Book
of Mormon & disarmed them of every weapon that they had chosen to fight
me with & it flung them into confusion & they did not wish to leave with

W. Woodruffhas injured him & given us friends. We have held regular meetings on the
Sabbath in [[Bath, Somerset, England|Bath]] [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]], & [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanely]]. We now have meetings in Burslem &
Hanly, [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]], [[Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, England|Newcastle]], [[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]], & a number of other places, round about
I have been informed that the [[Clement Leigh|Rector]] in New Castle is preaching against us
quite a number of Methodist teachers attend our meetings & freequently oppose
but they go away confounded while it begets us friends. We have quite a good
room in Hanly that we have lived for six months, which will be the sta[n]ding
place for the church to meet in on the Sabbath we have vary full & attentive
congregations how many will come out in this regeion I do not know
but the work seams to be prosperous here as yet, their has been a number
baptized since we came, the Church now Numbers between 70 & 870 &
others given in their names. I became convinced it was the will of God
for one of us to go to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] & taking all things into consideration
we thought it best for Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] to go. & consequently he left Burslem
for Birmingham on the 28th Jan & I suppose is now labouring in Birmingham
but I have not herd from him since he Left. We are determined by the
assistance of God to open a Door in Every town from the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] to Bir
mingham & erect a Standard in it. I feel as though it will be a day
of warning & not of many words to [[England|England]]. I think that what we do we
shall do quickly. I would here also remark their are a number of Doors
opening in the towns between the Potteries & [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] & preast Samuel
Heath & Elder [[Hiram Clark, b. 1795|Clark]] I believe are labouring there. I am enjoying go[o]d health &

[[Jennetta Richards Richards|wife]] Sister [[Elizabeth Ravenscroft|Elizabeth Revenscraft]] sends her respets to you & Sister Richards &
says tell Brother Richards that Mother will not have any more preaching at her
house. I wish you to Remember me to Sister Richards, & the family
where you reside & to Sister's [[Hannah Greenwood Fielding|Fielding]], & Dawson, & all who inquire. I suppose
I have not had any letters as yet come to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]]. I wish you to drop a
few lines to me after recieving this & inform me of your health & Sister
Richards & about all the Saints & any information that you may have from our
friends in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] or elswhere. I saw a late account in the paper of the destruct-

Dear Brother
Though I have no extraordinary information
to communicate to you at this time upon any subject, yet I thought I would
drop a few lines to you this morning, & let you know that I am alive &
enjoying good health, & what I am about &c We arived in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] the day we
left you, & saw Elder [[William Clayton|Clayton]] & the Saints in good spirits. I was much
pleased with my acquaintance with Brother Clayton I consider him a worthy
Brother a man of wisdom & of God. I was called upon in the evening with Brother Clayton
to go & visit that Sister that has been so much afflicted possessed with the Devil &c. I
do not recollect the name. her husband that was considered under Transgression came
to us & confessed his Sins, & next day made acknowledgments before the church.
When we arived at his house his wife was in a great rage required 3 men to hold her
We lade hands upon her & after a mighty struggle cast the devil out & rebuked
the fever & she was made whole & was at meeting comfortable next day, but
the devil entered into her child next, day & flung it into a dredful agony &
made it as stiff as a stake, we lade hands upon it, & the devil instantly came
out & the child fell asleep. I have herd nothing from them of late. We preached with
them on Sunday & had a pleasant time with them. We left Manchester on 
the 21st & rode to Burslem, & found Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] & the Saints well. I found
them meeting with some opposition in Burslem such as getting the candles
& candlesticks flung at their heads while preaching. The rabble generally was lead
by [[John James, Staffordshire|John James]]. We immediately commenced preaching & opening new doors
as we had an oppertunity. One evening while I was preaching in Burslem John James
came with two constables (to keep the peace for he feared the people) while he could read a 
pamphlet exposing Mormonism taking taken from Mormonism unveiled & [[Warren Farr Parrish|W. Parrish]]
letters & [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. pratts]] &c. I helped him to read then what I could, by giving him lights, &
water to quench his thirst, & calling for order while the house was hissing at him

their familyis there for they think it harder times than it is in the west to get

to pay our fare to [[England|England]] we have had much to struggle with. We
left home without purs or scrip, & sick & feble but through the great
mercy of God we have all been able to reach [[New York|New York]] but we all

precious to me, for I dreamed a few nights before that Sarah was dead but I thought
the dream might not be true, but come through multitude of business
& though. I returned & took supper with Elder Pratt, he has got a good [[Mary Ann Frost Pratt|wife]] she
often speaks of you, the whole family has had the fever & ague in [[New York City, New York County, New York|the City]] but

in public speaking & printing. he has already out of the press 2,500

expect will soon go to press & also he has other works in the press the
work is not ownly progressing in this City. but a great work is opening

the laboursers of [[Benjamin Winchester|B. Winchester]] & hunders [hundreds] are believing Brother Winchester

so If I had not been suddenly called to this City to have attended this con

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]].
Notwithstanding I sent you a long letter about
twenty days since; I feel disposed to address you at this time; & could I
but read a letter from you half as often as I write to you I should feel
exceding thankful: but I make allowances for Sickness & miscarriage
of letters &c. I have recieved one letter from you & that was great consola-
tion to my feelings. This is the fifth letter I have written to you & I
do hope that you have obtained them, the last letter I wrote Nov 24th which
I truly hope you will get. When you write to me please be particular to
tell me how many of my letters you have received & the Dates of them. I
am in great hopes that I shall have a letter from you before I leave the
City for the City [[England|England]]. I never more highly prised the worth of letter writ
ing than since I left home. I suppose of course that you wish to know how
matters & times are with me & have been since I last wrote &c. I contin[ue]d
preaching in [[New Jersey|New Jersey]], had full congregations, many were believing, some 
were embracing, & a warm & friendly feeling manifest by almost the whole
country whare I was. Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] called to see us, preached one, &
informed me that a conference was appointed in New York City on the
12th inst & wished me to attend I have done so & am now in the City.
âthe following I copy from my Journal. Dec 11th I took the parting hand with Elder [[Samuel James|James]]
& Brother [[James Ivins|Ivins]] & left them at 1 o'clock at night & rode 16 miles to [[Freehold Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Freehold]]. I
there took Stage at daylight & rode 12 miles to [[Middletown Point, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Middletown point]], there took
Steem Boat Wane sailed 30 miles to N. Y. City arived at 12 oclok. I entered the city
â& found it full of armed Soldiers spedily preparing for war thee Steem Boats
were chartered to conveyed them to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]] to fight several thousand Du-
Dutchman that ware Citizens near Albany that had strongly fortified themselves
with canon & small arms, it is said they will not pay their tokens or depts or
sumthing or other of that kind, & so they are going to fight about it, how much
âBlood will be shed I dont know. at any rate it is beginning to be war & rum
âour through America & [[Europe|Europe]] & all things are in commotion. After dining
in King stret, I called upon Elder P. P. Pratt in Mott street No 58 found him & fam-
ily well. Elders P. P. Pratt & [[Joseph T. Ball|J. Ball]] accompayed me to the post office. I rece[ived]d
two letters one from [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] all well in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]. one from [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]
he had been quite sick, lost $70 dollars, was very poor, had no decent
clothes, could not go to England, hardest times he ever saw, could not get
a dollar in money, but was gaining in health, was strong, in faith, urged me
to remember him to Phebe &c. &c. I did not get a letter from Phebe but took
one out for [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] from his [[Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt|wife]] in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] I gave the letter to[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] Mills

hope the day may come when you may have the privelege
of fully investigating the cause in which I am engaged for
I believe your honesty & dissermment would lead you
to imbrace it I have found one thing to be true that
when we seek first the Kingdom of God all things els mecessary
will be added. I should consider it one of the greatest blessings
on earth to have you & the rest of my Kinsman become
members of the Church of Latter day Saints & why I 
desire it is because I know it to be the true Church
of Christ & my friends would be exhalted before
God & receieve blessings that fadeth not away I certanly
could have no motive to desire my friends to receieve
darkness or error But I certainly have a chance [&]
know the reality of these things as well at least as those
who are out of the Church & not been privileged
with as closan close an inspection as myself yea & even
our enemies in this county are beginning to acknowl[edge]
of a truth it is in vain to raise their hands against [page torn]
great ene[mies] await us I would to God my friends were [page torn]
for them this world is passing the things of time are transitory
the things of the Celestial Kingdom [a]re eternal & worth possessing
I desire to meet you there. My hart hath also been much
penetrated for Brother [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azmon]] I have loved that Brother I love 
him yet I shall still plead before God for him I have
no other than the best of feelings towards him Although I am
ignorant of his feelings towards me the Lord knows I wish
all of my relatives well & if they knew what I know ^not wishing to boast^ they would
be up & doing but as it was in the days of Lot & Noah so will it
be when Christ apperars. Is it possible that I cannot have a 
natural Brother [to] partake with me the glory of God in these 
last Days I have thought the former Dealings of God with you
was preparing you for theis great work I trust time will yet
proove it to be so I shall pray for it at least write to me when

that had run against a snag store her hull & sunk at Wellsville I took
the stage to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] 90 miles & whene I arived at Kirtland I was almost
asstonished I at the alteration in the place since I was there in May

but now on my returen I fou^n^d a city as it were arising from the hills
& dales & a [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|temple]] standing in its midsts with its steeple pointing
towards heaven in honor of that God who commanded it be built
& framed the materials of which it was made. It was truly a happy
season to my soul to again meet the inhabitants of Kirtland those with
whom I had endured perils & tribulations I visited the house of the lord &
its contents & I saw that which I did not expect to behold in my generation
& among these things I say the Egyptian mummies & also the Book of 
Abram written by his own hand in ancient form. On last sabbath
I had the privelege of going up to the house of the Lord in Kirtland to 
worship with my Beloved Brethren I kno not ownly had the privilege of
hereing the word of God in company with about 1,000 Saints from the
sacred desk but also of declaring the word of God unto them. my happiness
hath been great to behold the work of God in these last days & Allthough
the gentiles rages & the priest imagin vain things yet the work of God will roll on

Dear Sir
As I have 
just taken my pen from a sheet directed to our Distant
parents I thought pirhaps it would not be amiss to
address a few lines to you as I have never had any reason to
believe that you had lost that friendship or attachment towards
me that I formerly have been made the partaker of an opportunity
afforded. Notwithstanding years have rolled away between us since
we saw each other face to face yet my attachment towards you
or my desire for your wellfare either in temporal or spiritual things
hath not either lessoned or abated. It certainly is gratifying to 
me to hear of the prosperity of my Brethren in evey lawful
pursuit Brother Asahel I have long felt anxious to again
hear from you I am sensible that it is not alltogether profitable to 
be always pouring upon any ones mind any subject however good
it may be lest be be weary in consequence of which I have remained
more silent upon those subjects in which I have been ingaged than I
otherwise should have done. But thinking perhaps you would like to
Know whare I was how & what I was doing I concluded to call your
mind to the perusal of this sheet. I would here rema^r^k that after
our last conference in the south I spent a few days in visting the 
Churches which God had rased up by my instrumentality in that country
I had a good season amo[n]g them I added 9 to their numbers &
took the parting hand I took water at [[Paducah, McCracken County, Kentucky|Paducah]] K.Y. on the 25 th of 
Oct after passing one boat that had sunk & run aground ourselv[es]
traveled 400 miles we reached [[Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky|Luisville]] I then went by land to [[Owenton, Owen County, Kentucky|Owenton]],
& spent two weeks preaching & visiting some Kinsman of Elder 
[[Abraham Owen Smoot|Snoots]] a travling Brother from [[Tennessee|Tenne]] who is with me we then went
to [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]] visited the big bone lick on the road the place whare
those large bones are taken that have been exhibited in [[Europe|Europe]] &
America. When I arived at Cincinnati My first business was 
to inquire at the store of Webster & Conway for you they told
me you had located at [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terrehaute]] Indianna & I was glad to learn
from them that the prospects for your prosperity was flattering[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] is much pleased with him. I
am as comfortable as I can expect and thin
gs appear favourable for my recoyery.
The people are verry friendly about here. Tell
me how you like his name and whether
you wish it to be different. I feel to give
thanks to my heavenly fater for his kindness

March 1st 1838but they told him that is was between ministers and they did not wish to meddle
with it, but brother [[Isaac Crockett|Crocket]] has come over to this district and says that he is more
calme than he was. I really hope that he will not procede with his suit for it will
only make trouble. I have almost forgotten to tell you that [[Milton Holmes|Milton]] has given up going
to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirt.]] next spring and wants to come down here in the spring. wants to meet you in
[[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] thinking that you will accompany me there in the spring he wants you
to write to him, says that he wishes he was with you here now. [[Justus Ames|Brother]] and sister
Ames [[Valentine Ames|Valentine]] and [[Melana Ames|Melana]] send there best respects to you and say they are trying to
do as well as they can, I think they are. Sister [[Mary Arey Brown|Brown]] and sister [[Sabra A. Young|Subra]] are here on
a visit and send there love to you and say that the church is doing well there.
They have just come in from meeting and say they have had a verry good
meeting, that brother Crocket was wide awake. You did not say any thing about
the time that you expected to return here, your three weeks have almost expired
and they have been long enough I think. I realy feal lonely here without my [paper torn]
but I trust that the Lord will take care of him and return him to me in
his time. I dont forget to ask him to daily and trust that I am not forgotten
by him. My health is good at present but I have been quite sick with a cold
I was much pleased to hear that brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] had joined your company
Give my best respects to him and tell him that I want to see him.
Miltonâs letter was sealed with black and there was greate enquiery concerning
the contents, but I did not let them know of the Kirtland affairs, some of them
here surmise that a mob has arisen and demolished the press in Kirtland
y but I shall keep the letter private untill you come and then you may
do as you think best with it. I think that these times will try the faith
of the saints but I think that I feal as strong as ever. b There will be
great persecution for thes things but there is a God in Israel yet thanks be
to God for it. I have not commenced your coat yet but shall soon. I recollect
that this is your birthday would be glad to congratulate you upon the same could I have
the privilege. This is from your [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] who is waiting as patiently as she can for your return.

[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]] took their families Saturday night and it is supposed they
have gone to [[Missouri|Missourie]] and the word is for all to follow that possibly can to
escape the destruction that is comeing upon [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|K.]] There is a great division there and
a number have left the church and raised what they call a standard of truth
and liberty and drew up a remonstration against wickedness and the pro
cedings that have been illegally, takeing for their guide the [[Book of Mormon|book of Mormon]] the
bible the and covenants for their guide. I will mention some of their names
[[Nathaniel Milliken|N. Milliken]] and [[Mary Fairfield Hayes Milliken|wife]], [[John C. Gaylord|John Gayland]] and [[Elizabeth Terry Gaylord|wife]], [[Warren Farr Parrish|W. Parish]] and [[Martha H. Raymond Parrish|wife]], J. F.

Willford and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]. there was about thirty five that signed the remon
strance, but the letter stated that there was thousands of the same opinion.
The high counsil met and cut them all of[f] from the church. Doct Cowd
ry has withdrawn from the church, the printing office has been taken and sold
for Josephâs and Sidneyâs debts N. Millikens bid it off, therefore we shall not
have the papers at present. I am verry sorry for that for there is much eccitem
ent here already about the delay of the papers and I suppose that they have the same
account here in the papers that you saw, some of them have already written to
the Post Masters in [[Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cleaveland]] and Kirt. to learn the truth of these things although
it is kept private here now. O Willford what is this world comeing to. my heart almost
shrinks within me when I look around on the state of things. Brother [[Joseph T. Ball|Ball]]
has received a letter from his [[Mary Montgomery Drew Ball|Mothers]] family in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] requesting him to return
to them and he thinks of starting in 8 or 10 days. I rather expect that he will
baptize Mr. [[Ephraim Grant Luce|Ephraim Luce]] and [[Lucy Fry|Lucy Fry]] as they have been waiting for an oppo-
rtunity most ever since you lelft. Brother [[Justus Ames|Ames]] has had his case tried and the cost
was trown upon him. Mr [[William Douglass|Douglass]] has been in a great rage about you he says
that he will spend all his property in law with you but that he will have his
character cleared up, he has applied to two Justices for an execution against you but[[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinalhaven]] March 1st. 1838
Beloved Willford
According to your request, I seat myse
lf this eve to pen a few lines to you after haveing just, returned from father
Lucesâ (where I have been spending a few days) to brother [[Justus Ames|Ameseâs]]. I passed by
brother [[Stephen Grant Luce|Stephen Lucesâ]] where the brethren have met for meeting, thinking
I would spend the time in writing to you. Brother [[Joseph T. Ball|Ball]] arrived here
last eve, and brought me a billet from you to day which I was glad
to receive. The church here are strong and well engaged likewise the
opposers are engaged to. Mr. Carter has held two mock meetings here of late,
he has a written manuscript which he has been collecting through the
past winter from newspapers &c which he reads to the people with
hymns addapted to the occasion. brother Ames and [[Valentine Ames|Valentine]] attended the
first meetting and bore a noble testimony for the truth they said
they never had so much liberty in speaking before. many people saw
the contrast between the two spiritsâbut none of the brethren attended
the last meeting. I have received three letters for you but no papers; one letter
was from [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother Woodruff]] bearing date of Dec. 31st. wherein in she says
that she has been quite sick but has far recovered also that [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] and [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]
were well and that her faith was encreaseing in the faith of latter Day Saints
and that nothing short of it would satisfy her mind &c. &c. another from
brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] wherein he acknowledges the reception of your last
letter. his remarks are more favourable than than sometimes. says that
he heard brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] preach in [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terra Haut]] last fall &c. The third
was from brother [[Milton Holmes|Milton]] he mentions that your much esteamed letter
came to hand and was gladly received. he had concluded almost that you
had not received his. he likewise received one from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] the same day
dated Jan. 14th. wherein he received information concerning matters in K. heMr Willford Woodruff

Willford Woodruff
I suppose you have no objections to my 
comeing east I was advised to do so by manypay sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] the sum of money I borrowed of her if you sent 
any and left word to have your letters forwarded to me in [[Maine|Maine]] I feel 
verry anxious to hear from you more so since you went to [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. 
I feel verry thankful that the Lord has blessed you in your ministry in the 
maner that he has since you have been gone from home but Oh! how long 
you have been gone sometimes my heart almost sinks within me when I 
think how long you have been gone and the scenes that I have passed through 
since you left me and was I to dwell upon it I should sink beneath it
but hitherto the Lord has supported me. do tell me when you think 
you will be at home the next time when you write if you can I 
often get quite impatient weighting your return. Could I have taken 
our little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] east with me it seames as though I should have been 
happy but Ah! I had to leave her remains in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] while I went 
east with my little [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willy]] but not without first visiting her grave and strew
ing it with leaves, but I leave this subject. The church in Commerce 
and [[Iowa Territory|Iowa]] is increaseing verry fast som somethings are taking place in 
the church which are bad but bu I will tell you more about it when
you come home which I hope and trust will be in the spring and 
hope you will be prepared fo with meanes to take me back in the spring ^with you^ 
although I expect my friends will be opposed to my going back and 
that was the greatest and only objection that I had to going home perhapse 
they may change my mind upon the subject but I hope not. I want you to 
write often for I think you do not feel as lonely as I do. Father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clarkâs]] 
family have been verry kind to me ever since I have been there and they 
wish to be remembered to you. I have sent you as many as eight or nine 
letters since Iyou left [[New York|N.Y.]] and paid the postage on them to N.Y. I feel verry 
sorry that you do not get them. I have not received any papers from you 
in [[England|Eng.]] should be much pleased to read them hope you will bring a coppy 
of them home with you and some hymbooks. I have lately received a letter 
from sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] they were well. [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father Carterâs]] family are well. 
I should be glad to call on [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father Woodruffâs]] family as I go along but 
shall not have time as it is so late in the season I should be glad [[New York City, New York County, New York|N. Y. Citty]] Dec. 6th 1840
Dear Willford
I presume you will be somewhat surprised 
when you learn where this letter was written but perhapse not more 
than I was when I went to my door in [[Iowa Territory|Iowa]] and saw brother 
[[Joseph Fabyan Carter|J. F. Carter]] and [[Luther Scammans|L. Scammans]] ride up to the door I could hard think 
it possible that they could be there but truly strange things happen in 
these last days, they came on to see the country and stoped with me about 
6 days and insisted on my accompanying them home and spending the 
winter at home and then if I wished I could return with you in 
the spring so we left [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] on the 16 of Nov. and arrived here yester-
day we have had a good and safe passage thus far and tolerable good health 
our [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|dear little babe]] was some unwell two or three days with the chills and 
fever but I procured some of the tonic mixture and gave him and it helped 
him so he is quite smart now. My health is good accepting some cold occasioned 
by traveling I hope to be comfortably situated  in my [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|fatherâs]] house before you re-
ceive this as we expect to leave here tomorrow for [[Maine|Maine]]. We are now at 
brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Iluseâs]] he has got a verry pleasent [[Martha Sloan Carter|girl]] for a wife about 18 years old. 
You told me in your last communication that you was going to send me 
some money and wished me to spend it in some ^the^ way that would make me 
the most comfortable so I thought that way would be to go home and spend 
the winter with my relatives hope to see you in Maine in the spring 
I packed up my things and left them at father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clarks]] where I have been living 
and left them in their care with my heifer the cow I let a widow woman have 
for her milk she is to keep her for her milk untill my return. I have not heard 
from you since last july or your letter was dated th 6th of July where in you 
mentioned brother [[Theodore Turley|Turleyâs]] return home and mentioned writing and sending
me some things by him he had not arrived when when we left but was 
expected daily as we heard he had left [[New York|N. Y.]] with his company for Montrose
but it was getting so late in the season that we dared not wait any longer 
so I borrowed 15 dolls. of sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] and told I saw and engaged sister
[[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] to take charge of the things you sent until our return and to paynan5
are in our city.
I shall be pleased to hear from you as often as you 
have time to write.
The brethren of the Historical corps, and my family
wish a kind remembrance to you and all say, God bless and 
prosper bro. Gibson on his mission.
I remain

to the world: if they differ as widely upon other subjects as they
do upon Mormonism. I would have supposed that if an
Editor in any part of the states had made such a statement
at this advanced stage of Mormonism that he would have been 
considered a fit subject for an insane asylum, for that old Spaulding
story has been fully exploded [exploited] for the last twenty years, and al[l] consider
the author of that contribution either consummately ignorant or wilfully
wicked in presenting such a statement as authentic. Concerning 
utah affairs I will say all is peace and quietude, an abundant
harvest of wheat and a good prospect for all kinds of grain and 
vegetables.
There is some sickness of late. My daughter, Phebe, Mrs. 
Snow, lost an infant born on the 6th inst., all of your family in 
the valley are well. I see Lulah frequently she seems to enjoy good 
health and spirits.
Captn. Burton of the British army, a nobble harder
has been visiting us for some ten days. I accompanied him over
the President's dwellings, gardens, and premises and we also gave
him some Historical items of the Mormon war and other mat-
ters. Hee appears much pleased with his visit to and with 
President Young and friends and of the city in general; he 
takes sketches of the city from the observatory, of President Young's 
beehive mansion. He is much of a gentleman, he has traveled
enough to throw off that prejudice which many feel towards those 
^not^ of their political and religious faith.

or title [tittle] shall fall unfulfilled, and the spirit of the Lord will 
bear testimony unto you that they are true when you read
these lines. And I would exhort you, bro. Gibson to be 
true and faithful unto the Lord your God, call upon him 
in mighty prayer, follow the dictates of his holy spirit and
his blessings will increase upon you daily, and the spirit of 
the Lord will be like fire shut up in your bones and your 
testimony will be strong and powerful before your fellow men 
and you will be enabled to say of a truth that you would
rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God and associate with
the Lord's anointed than to partake of all the pleasures that
are found in the tents of wickedness.
It is your privilege to constantly enjoy the Holy 
Ghost â to know the mind and will of God concerning you
day by day â to be led by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit 
in every act of your life. This spirit will reveal to you 
every snare and trap, or evil of any kind that an enemy, 
whether it be men or devils shall lay for your feet, and will suggest 
a way for your escape.
What great blessings the Gospel of Jesus christ vouchsafes
to all who obey its simple precepts and keep the commandments 
of God; yet how few place themselves in a position to appreciate 
these things. But I will stop preaching with my pen and 
re[fer] to some items of news.
From the specimen you sent me of the contents of the
American Biographical dictionary, I judge there will be a wide difference
tween it and the new American Cyclopedia [Encyclopedia] in carrying inteligencenan2
for this is opening wide doors whereby much may be accom-
plished in a short time. Such things will help to ripen the
earth speedily and prepare it for the day of reaping and 
leave the nations without excuse in the day of God's visitations
which are nigh the dor.
I have felt from the commencement of my acquaint-
ance with you that you are one of the instruments the Lord
will make use of in presenting the principles of eternal 
truth before this generation in such a way that they will 
have no power to plead ignorance before the Lord whether they
receive or reject your testimony. And I pray the Lord to bless
you and to inspire your heart, nerve your spirit and fully 
prepare you to magnify that station which you are destined
to fill before this generation; yes, brother Gibson as the Lord
lives you have a great work to perform in your day and 
one too, that will not only cause your heart to rejoice in bearing
testimony of the word of God and the revelations of Jesus Christ and
the principles of life and salvation, but it will cause the hearts of tens
of thousands of the honest of your fellow men to rejoice and be made 
glad because of the testimony which you will have power to bear
with your words and pen, it will also cause the ears of the 
wicked to tingle and their hearts to be pierced with much sorrow 
because of rejecting your testimony and the testimony of others of 
the servants of God.
These things are true, they are the strong whisperings
of the holy spirit unto me, and if you are faithful not one

Brother Gibson:â
Dear Sir:
I received your two letters of 
June 15th, and Aug. 7th, respectively, both of which were highly
interesting and edyfying. I read them to Prisident Young and
council, your daughter, Captn. [Cooper?] and many other friends, 
who were all highly pleased to hear from you. Your daughter
says she writes you very often.
Your letters please me they shew plainly that the 
spirit of your mission is upon you. Your labor in searching
out and stirring up the cold and lukewarm saints in the 
various branches through the country was a good work.
Oceanicus' letter to the mountaineer was published
and read with much interest.
That the Japanese ambassadors to the proud
high-minded Americans, could not find a linguist among the
literate of this great nation, who could speak to them without
an interpreter till they met a Latter-day saint, is rather sig
nificant and adds to the signs that Israel is to be head and
not the tail, and the mighty nations of the earth are begin-
ning to feel a little of the forebodings of this truth, notwith
-standing the present smallness of the little stone or kingdom
which Daniel saw.

penilty on such Proceedors I proposed to accompanying them some 
of my Brethren into the midst of the mob to see who they were 
that we might get suficient testimony against them but 
they objected to my going lest I should be ingured by a showr of 
stones which fell from every hand like hail however some 
of the Brethren went out themselves into their midst and took 
their names of the leaders of the mob and again returned to 
the house amidst a showr of stones and brick bats but with 
out injury they meeting immediately retired and the mob dispersed 
after we cleared the chambers of brick batts and stones we ret
ired and had a good nights rest this begins to show me something,

as there has been four or five church Clarkes and a number musician 
with many of their members Baptised into the church of Jesus Christ

already Just before I lelt [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] I met with the saints 
at Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kingtons]] house in [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|dymock]] for the purpose of holding 
a prayer meeting and as the saints began to asemble the sound of a 
beet upon Kettles pails and pans was heard through the streets 
and very soon a mob colected of 50 or 100 who payded rank 
and file in from of the house where we were assembled 
we immediately closed our window shutters and door in the 
room where we were I then opened meeting by singing and 
prayer and as soon as we commenced the mob armed themselves 
with stones brick bats and eggs and every thing else they could lay 
their hands upon and began to showr them upon the hous like

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Wife]] I once more call your attention to a perusal ^of^ a few 
Lines from me as it as been about a Month since I sent my last which I

but when on dilligent search we found the whole City given to priest 
craft idolatry and wickedness of ever discription and every door
closed against us we did not Hesitate to go into the streets and Johna
like cry repentance unto that city and our cry has not been altogether 
in vain for we have sowed seed that will bring forth fruit to the honor
and Glory of God and laid the foundation which will not be removed 
untill the inhabitants thereof are left without excuse and the honest 
in heart and the meek of the Earth are gathered out this I say in the name 
of Jesus Christ the feew days which I spent in London has been the most 
profitablest school to me in many respects of any period of my life

faith, & confidence. he is a chosen vessel in 
the hands of God, let the Saints stand by 
him & his councillors & God will bless them
but if they forsake him even in an hour of trial
persecution or trouble it will be to their hurt
& the experiance of 10 years shows that God is with him 
& he is an old tried friend & my prayer to god is 
that he may have wisdom power, & means to soon 
esstablish Zion & her stakes to be a place of rest 
for the poor Saints. I hope Dear Brother that 
after a few more months the Lord will enable 
us to greet each other face to face. I feel

had several interviews with you in my sleep & ^on^ one occasion [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] was not 
with us & I enquired where she was you said she was Dead & gave me sumthing 
of an account of it, but as I had heard from you since & she was well, it had almost 
worn of my mind, I found from my conversation with you you had many
lonely hours, & some gloomy meditations, as you were left alone so long & had no
Relatives to keep you company, I know this is trying & none would have bourn it 
better than you have done possessing that warm attachment to friends & Relatives 
which virtue hath been so perminant in your whole life, Was it in my power 
I would willingly bear your sorrows myself, but as I cannot I am comforted 
with the reflection, that these sorrowful hours are not lade upon you because of 
crime on your part or mine but that we are seperated for the Sake of the 
Gospel & the cause of Christ, If any of our friends are in any more comfortable 
circumstances as to the things of this present evil world in the midst of ease & 
without sacrafice, how will it be a few years hence at the coming of Christ in 
the resurrection the general judgment & in the Eternal World. my object is to be 
on the safe side there, My object is to secure a safe abode in the Eternal world
even a Celestial Kingdom, yes if I can but once see this second to 
myself my wife & childen it will amply reward me for all my toils & labours
my sacrafises & my hours of sorrow in this life, yes I can say wellcome 
all these things If I can but at last obtain the favor of my God & a place 
whare he dwelleth with my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Wife]] & the children which God hath given us.
My constant prayer to god is that he will feed & cloth you, comfort your 
heart, raise you up friends in my absens, & let his angels guard you & give
you grace according to your day in all things & spare your life & the remain
ning child for my sake. I am sorry you have not obtained more of my 
Letters I have written you more than a dozen since I have been in [[England|England]]
& I have received a number from you which has done me much good, I also
sent a large number of letters to you by Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] & the company which 
went with him. (I also ^sent^ you by Elder Turley Â£7 seven sovreigns with many other things for you &
Sarah Emma & [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]], which I trust you have got before time I have others presents for you which I shall bring when
I come, which will be early in the spring if the Lord will) I sent two letters by Elder [[Samuel Mulliner|Mulliner]] to you

Extract of W Woodruff Journal Oct 18th After bearing testiment 
to the Saints in London, & feeling a witness that there would 
be a good work in this city. We retired to rest in good season
I felt well in my mind & slept untill 12 oclock at night
I awoke & meditated upon the things of God untill near 
3 oclock & while forming a determination to warn the people 
of London & overcome the powers of darkness by the assi
stance of God, A personage appeared unto me which I 
considerd to be the prince of Darkness or the Devil. he made 
war with me & attempted to take my life he caught me by 
the throat & choaked me nearly to death he wounded me in 
my forehead I also wounded him in a number of places 
in the head As he was about to overcome me I prayed 
to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ for help, I then 
began to have power over him, the Lord sent his Angels 
unto me who deliverd me by wounding my enemy & driving
him from me one personage dressed in white who I thought 
was a friend i had seen before came to me prayed with me 
& healed me. & I was instantly made whole & deliverd As soon 
as I could speak I awoke Br [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] who was also in trouble52 Ironmonger Row, [[St Luke's, Middlesex, England|St Lukes]], London. Octr. 30th 1840.
My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]],
I received your kind & affectionate letter ^written^ in the midst of
affliction & mourning under Date of July 18th 1840. truly your
letter brought tidings which were painful & sorrowful to me, but
notwithstanding this it was not without its joys, For while I keenly 
felt the [roots], & to mourn the Loss of the lovely flower which God had lent
unto us a few days & then taken it away in an hour that was best calcu
lated to try the feelings of a kind & affectionate Mother & an absent Father
& while I felt to sympathise with my Dear Companion who alone had been 
called to watch her tender ospring in my absence & behold her life depart & follow
her remains to the grave without a single relative to mingle a tear, you in the 
midst of this affliction meditation & sorrow I truly rejoice before the Lord, I rejoice
that God hath taught us the principles of life & Death, time & Eternity, the Resurrection 
& the judgment. I rejoice that we are not Called to mourn without hope, but
that we have the fulest assurance that we shall meet our [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Child]] in the first resurrection
As we have got to come up through great tribulations in order to inherit
the Celestial kingdom of God, I rejoice that in all these trials, sacrifises losses
& crosses, we have one the less to go through. I again rejoice that God hath
given you grace, strength & fortitude, to support you in the midst of 
this deep affliction, & it hath been the highth of my joy, sweetened all my lonely
lonely meditations, & filled the days of my consolation to know that God hath
granted me a companion in this life who hath been willing to make evry sacrafice 
which God hath lade upon her for my sake for the sake of Christ & for the sake of 
a celestial kingdom whare we shall reign forever, whare the wicked & ungodly
will scease from troubling & the weary be at rest, yes my Dear Companion
in affliction, you may rest assured, the whole spirit of your letter the resignation
you manifest gives me great joy. I know your sorrow, trials & afflictions are
keen, & sacrifices great. Why is it there with you, with me & with the Saints at large
in evry age of the World. Ah the first resurrection will tell, the judgment of 
the great day will declare, & the Celestial glory of God will more fully illustrate
the truth of all these things unto you then I can possibly do with my pen
the Lord Jesus suffered & desended below all things, the Holy prophets & Apostles 
in evry age of the world have suffered greatly & come up through tribulations
in there day & now we have ours, & we shall find at last that all our sufferings 
trials, & privations are ownly to prove us & more fully prepare us to rightly
prise that rest, comprehend the glory, & enjoy the fulness of that reward which we shall receive
at the end of the race, Then under this view of things shall we not kiss the rod & be
resigned, I can exclaim yes with every feelings of my Soul, I can say with my
Dear Wife the Lord hath given & the Lord hath given & the Lord hath taken
away & blessed be the name of the Lord. I I can but bear evry trial that I am
called to pass through in this life as well as I have the Death of Sarah Emma I shall bee
thankful, she was a beautiful flower, I loved it with all all my heart but as willingly
resigned it to God. I shall never forget the last look she gave me when I took the parting 
hand with her. The first intimation I had of her death was on the 22d of Oct several 
letters was sent me from [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] one of which was from Elder [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] &
while reading over the list of the Deaths among the Saints Sarah Emma Woodruff
caught my eye, it produced a peculiar sensation in my mind which went through 
me like electricity yet my nerve was firm I continued reading as though nothing 
had happened & from that moment to the present I have felt perfectly resignedMrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]]

Notwithstanding we have Baptized about 500 whare I am now labouring, yet it does not

these are busy days with me. Preaching, Baptizing, confirming, Ordaining, Counciling,
writing, trouhing, keeping journals, & all together gives me but little time to
rest But I never enjoyed Better health or Spirits than at the present time. I am
now at Elder Thomas Kingtons whare we make it our home he was the superintendent
of 45 preachers & the Same number of licensed preaching places. I Baptized him with
the other preachers which have opened those doors for us to preach in I Baptized Brother Kington

[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] it does my Soul much good to see your resignation to the will of God
in the midst of our seperation. The Lord is blessing me labours much in this land, be
patient untill we meet again, you shall not loose your reward, for your reward
shall be to stand with me in Zion with the children which God shall give us. & enjoy
each others society with our children for one thousand years while Christ reigns
& then to inherit the earth together to part no more. & enjoy far greater glories
& Blessings than the present state of things can afford. I think this will a[paper torn] repay us
for any sacrifice we can make for a few years. Pray for me that I may be humble in
the midst of prosperity as well as adversity. I feel a great desire to do the will of God in
all things. My prayer to God is that health & strength, grace & resignation to the will of God
may continue with you & the children which God has given us unto the end. & Also that
God will Bless [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] & his councillors with means, wisdom, & power to do the work of God in
Zion & her stakes. & that all the Saints may be Sanctified by a Celestial Law is the prayer of
Willford Woodruff
Remember me to [[Brother Meacham|Brother Meacham]] I know how to sympathize with him with a broken leg. You ask me if I
can tell you when I shall come home No Phebe I cannot tell you now but I shall return to the
bosom of my family as soon as the Lord will. I expect quite a number of the saints will go to America
from [[England|England]] this fall. We probably shall know more what the will of God is concerning us in few months
hence. we have made some enquiry of Joseph (by letter) concerning us we expect to hear from him before
long. the Lord is getting some strong holds in this country we are laying the foundation for a mig
hty work here, two or three of us think of visiting [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] immediately after the conference if the Lord will
& setting up the work there. write as soon as you get this & give me all the knews & tell me how
you & the children get along direct to [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]], [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], [[England|England]]. I ever remain your Willfordhome it will be so much less care & trouble than it will be to see to your own
wood water &c. this is simply my present feeling upon the subject, Remember me with gratitude
to [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Brother Clark]]. & tell him for me that if he feels willing to lend you the hand of assistance in
this your time of need & let you tarry with him untill my return, that he shall not
loose his reward & he shall have my prayers & Blessing & the Blessing of God shall rest upon
him & his children, & his childrens children untill the latest generation, could I
have the privilege of being with my own family I would not trouble any person with
them, But a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me in common with my
Brethren & required at our hands in consequence of which my family must be assisted by
some one in time of need. & I say again in the name of Jesus Christ that that soul
who does good to my wife or children while I am in the vineyard of the Lord doing his work
shall be blessed of the Lord & no power shall take it from them, & I feel vary thankful
to Brother Clark for his kind offer. Give my respects to the [[Polly Keeler Clark|Sister Clark]] you speak of & also Brother
Clarks Son, Remember me to [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Bror]] & [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Sister Smoot]], & Brother [[Lyman Wight|L. Whight]] & family should you see them

the Saints being rewarded for their loss by the government. I was much pleased with your
letter it contained much news. I gave you an account in my last letter of my
opening a new field in the South part of [[England|England]], in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], the work of the Lord
has continued to roll on from the time I first commenced preaching in this part of the
land untill the present time in a manner that I have never before seen it in these last
days, it is not yet 3 months since I first lifted up my voice to preach to the people in
this part of England a region which had not herd the sound of it before but now conta
ins a Church of 500 Saints, with about 50 Elders & priests. about 50 of which 
were preachers of the orders of the day, I have administered Baptism to about 300 of
the Saints above spoken of, & Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] & [[Willard Richards|Richards]] & the Elders & priests which
we have raised up in this Branch have Baptized the other 200, & the field which is opened
here is so large & extensive that it seems as though the work had but just began
here & I expect hundreds will be added to the Church here. It is rapidly opening
doors in all the Surrounding country in the South of England & also in [[Wales|Wales]] we have
Baptized some few in the Border of wales. We have this day receeved the first No of the
Latter Day Saints [[Millennial Star|Millennial Star]]. published by the travling council Edited by [[Parley Parker Pratt|P P Pratt]] at

Dated March 8th & 22d & most of these letters was full of glad tidings so much
so that it drove sleep from our eyes for the night. & we both felt more like going

rest assured it created no small degree of joy in my mind to receave a letter from
your hand for it is the first word I have recieved from you & the ownly one since
I saw you excepting one letter which I receved from you while in [[New York|New York]]. I have not

I had no doubt but what the churches in that place will soon No. 1000 souls. 
We have set all the churches in that region in Order, â ^with^ Officers members presiding 
over them, & they are now Baptizing daily in that region, about 50 of those 
Baptized, were preachers of different Orders. Between 3 & 400 hundred of which, I 
have Baptized: & so you see the sacrafice which we are called to make, is not 
in vain. I feel vary thankful to God for the manner he has blessed me in 
my labours sine I have been in [[England|England]]. I also attended a conference 
the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire potteries]] on my way to [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]], & had an interesting time. 
I arivd in Manchester On the 1st day of July, & I spe^n^t 3 days with the Twelve, 
& other friends in writing, transacting business, visiting the Saints, preparing for the confer
ene, &c. & had a pleasant time. On Sunday the 5th of July, I met with the 
Saints, & a large congregation of Citizens in the Joiners Hall in Manchester, for public 
worship: this hall, the Saints have hired for their regular place of meeting, they 
pay Â£100. (about $500) yearly; it will seat about 2000 souls; the rent is paid by 
contribution. There was about 1000 persons present, I preached in the forenoon & 
several testified in the Afternoon, while we were communig with about 400 
Saints: the power of God was upon the people. Monday, July 6th the quorum 
of the Twelve & a general conferene of the Church of L.D.S. sat in conferene

the last three months; & 374 members, 9 Elders, 50 Priests, & 13 Teachers of the above number, were 
added in the Herefordshire churches in which ^where^ I had been labouring. But the foundation is 
now la^i^de in such a manner in this country, & new Doors opening in England, Scotland, 
[[Ireland|Ireland]], & [[Wales|Wales]], so that we have evry reason to expect a greater increas for the months 
to come, than has been in the thee that are past.
I pray God to roll on this work in 
mighty power in this country & in all Nations & enable us to be humble in the 
midst of prosperity, & work righteousness with all diligence while the day last, & learn

I hope to obtain letters from you as Often as one in a Month for I shall 
endeavor to write as often as that & hope you will do the same. I have 
and shall have much that I would like to communicate to you from

I am enjoying the best of health & spirits, & am happy;

my joy & consolation: But Knowing that we shall have our reward for 
all the sacrafices that we are called to make in this life, for Christ sake, & 
for all that we do in his cause & y Vineyard, causes me to be reconciled 
to his will. I wrote a letter to Prsdt [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in company with 
Elder [[George Albert Smith|G.A. Smith]], & [[Theodore Turley|T. Turley]], June, 27th, In which I gave him a Brief accou

was held on the 21st of June, at [[Stanley Hill, Bosbury, Herefordshire, England|Stanly Hill, Herefordshire, England]]. Elder Richards & myself 
conducted the meeting, or conferene with the help of God. & I never saw more 
business executed in one day, than on that occasion. We organized 20 churches, Ordained 4 Elders, 7 Priest, & 4 Teachers; Baptized 10, Confirmed 20, & Blessed 20 children, 
besides a multitude of other business, & broke bread to several hundred Saints, &c. 
The work had been so rapid, it was impossible to ascertain the exact No. belonging 
to each branch, but the whole Number is 33 churches, 534 members, 75 officers, viz; 
10 Elders, 52 Priest, 13 Teachers, all of which had imbraced the work in less time thanMrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]]

I will constatly remember you before a throne of grace. Willford
I dont know as you can make out my writing I have no time to write ownly in great heast & not time to 
[pââââââate] hardly look them over but read what you can & I will read the rest when I comethat we should spend a few months more before we return, The work of the
Lord is rolling on swiftly in this land & the present signs are that the gentiles will
spedily be warned. Already are there thousands rejoiceing in the New & Everlasting Covenant 
in [[England|England]], the standard of truth as an ensign to the people is reared up in the largest
cities of [[Scotland|Scotland]], & Saints rejoicing therein The warning voice is spedily to be heard
in the City of [[Belfast, Antrim County, Ireland|Belfast]] Ireland,  The cry is heard in [[Wales|Wales]] come & preach unto us 
Already ^has^ ^has^ the fulness of the gospel started upon the wings of the wind & the Bellows of 
the deep by the hand of an Elder of Israel to the [[East Indies|east Indies]], This vary day a gallant Ship 
spreads her sail at [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] into which Elder [[William J. Barret|William J. Barret]] enters as his Ark to convey
him in safty to South [[Australia|Australia]] to proclaim the everlasting gospel to that far distat people
Notwithstanding he is but 17th years of age he is clothed with the power of the Priesthood
the revelations of Jesus Christ, of the spirit of his mission. Notwithstanding he has this 
day left his native country & started on his voyage of 16000 [10000] miles yet he is filled 
with rejoicing & his soul is made glad, which is fully manifest in a letter which 
has just reached us from his hand exhorting us to be faithful & pray for him 
declairing in the name of God that he will return to Zion bringing his 
sheaves with him, he has taken our addresses in England & president
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smithjr]] in the U.S.A. & sayes he will write to him after he esstablises
his mission. he was raised up in the church at [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Stafford Shire Potteries]]. Thus 
you see the gospel is winging its way with the rapidity of lightning throu
ghout the wor[l]d. Thus you see by the help of God we are laying the foundation 
of a mighty work throughout the European wor[l]d & other Islands of 
the Sea. We expect to spedily lift up the Standard in the City of London
& visit France ^[[France|France]]^ & [[Germany|Jermany]] during the winter if the Lord will, The [[Millennial Star|Millennial Star]]
begins to dawn & we hope soon to behold the rising Sun Now in the time
for us to prove ourselves, & work while the day Last lest night come when no
man can work. & while the work is rolling on swiftly in foreign Nations I
rejoice to hear of the progress of it in my own County esspecially this the seed
of Israel in the western wiles have begun to receive the fulness of the gospel. I pray 
my heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ to hasten the day when Ephraims Nobles
will be of himself & his Gover[n]our procede out of the midst of him & Judah rejoice
& Israel be made glad, & Judah Jerrusalem be rebuilt upon her own heaps, 
& Zion become the joy of the whole Earth. Roll on O ye little stone cut out 
of the mountain without hands. untill ye become a mountain & fill the whole the 
whole Earth[[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Burslem]] [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire Potteries]] England July 17th 1840
My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Companion]]
As I have occupied one of two pages as you will find in other 
letters in conversing about temporal matters & things of miner consequene I feel
disposed to fill this page in expressing my feelings unto you upon the great plan
of Salvation, sumthing of my present expectations & an account of the work in this
Land. When I take into consideration the day & generation in which we live even in this 
last dispensation & fullness of times, the awful calamity that awaits the gentile
Nations of the present age, The Allmighty work of God that is to be accomplised before 
the Comeing of Christ, the esstablishing of Jerrusalem in her power, & Zion in her 
glory, the pruning of the vineyard once more for the last tine, & form some small 
view of those greater misteries & glories of the Celestial Kingdom which are not lawful to 
be w[ri]tten & are yet to be revealed, & having a dispensation of the gospel committed unto 
me in common with my Brethe which is ^to^ accomplish the great work of God which
he has set has hand, ^to do^ I say when I comprehend these things I do not summon words
that God has call us to make such great sacrafices in these last days, I now see the
greater the sacrafice the greater the crown [FIGURE] The ancient Saints of God have been called 
to make great sacrifices that they might comprehend a Selestial Glory, then if 
we enjoy the same glory we are called to make a sacrafise also, & have we 
not done it, yes verily we have equal to any people that ever lived according to the tine
we have been a people, or church of Christ I cannot make a greater sacrafise
than the society of my wife & family ^children^ but notwithstanding this sacrifice is of of the 
keenest kind to my wife as well as myself yet does my Bosom friend in her heart
ever for a moment wish me to scease doing the will of God, or in the least to tarnish
our future & eternal glory, or to dim our crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord-
Jesus No I will not for a moment believe it. Then my Dear friend & companion still 
continue patient untill my return which will be as soon as is the will of God
though we are seperated a few days here yet we shall reign & live together 1000 years
with the children which God shall give us & also with our Lord Jesus Christ & 
we shall also enjoy each other society in a Celestial Kingdom to part no more
We now laying the foundation here of a great work even directly or indirectly
among all the gentile Nations. M ^our^ present intention is to spend the winter in [[Europe|Europe]]
& return to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] in the Spring it is a great voyage & journey from 
[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] to [[England|England]] & as we are hear it appears to be wisdom & the will of GodMrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]]

the most Noted one I have visited is the splended Ancient Cathedral standing in the City of

architecture mine eyes ever beheld it is about 500 feet in length parts of it about 150 in
highth it was 8 or 900 years of age[.] it contained many Monuments & portraits of persons
graven out of solid marble & lade over the tombs & vaults of Ancient Bishops, Lords, & Princes
some of which have lane there for 7 or 800 years it is said that some of those monument with
their winding sheets al of which are car[ve]d out of solid marble is as neatly executed as any
thing found in [[Europe|Europe]] Almost every thing about it is carved out of solid fine marble. the whole
pulpit with all its trimings & hangings & deorations is carved out of one solid stone. There is a large
organ in the building & the church of England still worship there & hold a meeting twice every day
in a year We stayed though one service. We also have been on to the top of [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]] which is
the most Noted Hill in England in consequene of it being the highest Hill in England & the most
splended prospect of all the surround country for 30 miles & on some of the Highest peaks are

My [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Dear Companion]], in all our sacraifices, afflictions sickness, sorrow, &
persecutions let us strive to be patient & resigned to the will of God in all these
things I am well aware that these things are not joyous but grievous for a moment
but afterwards it will yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto those that
are exercised thereby. Let us not think strange that our afflictions are multiplyd
upon us for it is through tribulations that we inherit the Kingdom & we have but little
time to pass through these trials & tribulations before the scene will be closed & joy
will come & we shall enter that rest that remains for the Saints [page torn] the Lord will
make a short work in the Earth this last time. & our sorrows will not be lengthened
as many of the Ancients were for the want of time which may account for our having
so many of them in quick succession. I have had much joy & consolation vibrate
my bosom in my lonely meditations while walking over the parks, fields &, hills of England
even at the thought that I have a companion that thus far has not hesitated to make
the sacrifices which God has required of her, & inasmuch as you have done it thus far
do not be discouraged in future trials for your reward is great & your joy shall
be full & no power shall take it from you. I expect to reign with you in the
malinneum [millennium] & als[o] in a Celestial Glory with the Children which God may give us
which will more then pay us for the toils we have in this Life. That the Blessings of God may rest
upon you & give you the desire of your heart & bestow upon you food rament, grace & friends
is the prayer of your companion who is in the vineyard of the Lord Willfordwill be several hundred Baptzed soon in this part of the vineyard there is now nearly 200 sants

went to see him & carried him some provisions & money so that he should not suffer. he has
friends now that are administering unto him so he has what he needs I expect he will soon
be liberated he is preaching to the prisoners & some want to be Baptzed I saw two men hung
at the gaol the day I went to visit him. Elder Tayler is well & has just recievd a letter from

other small articles their is much of the spirit of gathering with the Saints in this Land John
Benbow has sold his property to the amount of about Â£1,500 & wants to go as soon as the Lord will[.]
I have had some scenes here some like ancient times soon after I commencd preeching
in [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]] or Herefordshire the Sound spedily went abroad & thee Ministers or preahers came more
then 20 miles in a gig to see me & inquire into thes things they never had herd me preach or
any of our people & when they came to the house whare I was I had put on a change of clothing
to go to the pool to baptzed a preacher that had baptized recevd my testimony I invited them into the
room whare I was & I asked them what their business was with me. they said they had come
to learn who I was & who had sent me & what message I had for them & the people. I then
stood up & taught them Jesus Christ & the first principles of the gospel & testified of the Book
of Mormon & the great work which God had set his hand to accomplish & while I was
yet speaking the spirit of God rested upon us & bore testimony unto them of the truth of
my words & they bowed down & prayed & gave glory to God for his marvelous work & they
rose up & the Charriot stood still while all four of these preachers went down into the
pool & I Baptzed them & lade my hands upon them & they recevd the Holy Ghost & went
their way rejoiceing. I went into the town of Ledbury to preach for the first time
& as soon as the people herd that I was in town they gathered together in companies wanting
to hear, the Baptist Minister offered to open his Chapel for me & he went into the pulpit with
me & opened the meeting by reading the 35 chapter of Isaiah & praying mightyly for the Lord to bless
me & make me an instrument of doing much good after which I arose & preached to[[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]], [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], [[England|England]], April 24th, 1840.
My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]
I again appropriate a little time to fill a sheet to you. which I shall
mostly take up in giving an account of the work of the Lord in this Country. I wrote you
a long letter while in [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]] at the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|potteries]], but whether it has fallen into your hands or
not I do not know. You have been anxious No doubt to hear from me from time to time, &
I have been equally as anxious to hear from you, but I do hope that you have not been as
much disappointed in your desires in this thing as I have in mine for though I have written
to you as often as once a month since I left home, yet I have not seen the first mark
of your pen but once since I last saw you, & then you & [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] was both sick in bed
& you must realize that my desire has been vary great to hear from you Sisters [[Frances Amelia Kimberley Turley|Turley]] &
[[Thankful Gill Clark|Clark]] both wrote to their husbands & their letters arivd safe & I was in hopes to have herd a
word about you some way but in this I was also disappointed, I do not make these remarks wishing
to cast any reflections at all for I presume you have written several Letters to me since
I left home but they must have been lost by the way somewhere. But I want you s[t]ill
to continue to write to me often for I may obtain some of them. I want to hear from you
& little Sarah vary much. I continued Labouring in Staffordshire about the Potteries untill
the first of March when I left the church in that place in the care of [[Theodore Turley|Elder Turley]] numbering nearly
one hundred & I went into the South part of England about 80 miles from the Potteries or whare the
word had been preached at all & I made a stand near Ledbury in Herefordshire[.] it is about 40
miles from [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]], 30 from [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]], 100 from [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] & bordering upon [[Wales|Wales]], I commenced
Working & the Lord worked with me in a wonderful manner I first stoped at Mr [[John Benbow|John Benbow]]s a large
farmer he was cultivating 5 or 600 acres of Land[.] his Brother [[William Benbow|William Benbow]] went from the potteries
with me to his Brothrs I expect you will soon see him in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] or [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] for he has gone to
America & will call upon you. I arivd at John Benbows on the 5th of March I preached at
his house on the 5th & was convinced that their was many that would come into the church I also preached
on the 6th & Baptzed 6 persons 4 of which were preachers of the United Brethren of the Methodist order, John Benbow & [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]] were baptized

[[New York|New York]] & I must come immediately & meet with them in
conference at [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] & so I left this part of the vineyard & travled 160 
miles to Preston & attended a conference with the 12 & the church in general 
& had an interesting time. I was truly happy to meet our Brethren from
America & immediately after the conference I returned accompaned by Elder 
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] & Elder [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] will soon join us in this vast field that 
is now open before us I never have seen such a vast field for labour
as the Lord has enabled me to open where I now am since the church was
first established either in America or England. I preached here one month
& 5 days & baptized the superintendant of the Church of the United Brethren & about
45 Preachers of the same order with about 120 of the members making about
160 in all, & this senery has flung into my hands or under my care &

items of Worth to you but I would say as to the jew 
al the Prosperity of the Church it is Superior to any time 
since itsâ Rise as the Elders in All Parts of the world have 
the most unlimited Influence in the Proclamation of the 
Word Pres. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Smith]] has just went through A co^u^rse of 
lectures in ([[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce ^Nauvoo^]]) & Allso on this side of the [[Mississippi River, United States|River]] 
that has been of Great worth unto usâ on the subject of 
Eternal Judement Organization of the world &c Allso 
Apointed a branch of A stake of Zion At [[Nashville, Jackson County, Iowa Territory|Nashville]]

seem much pleased with their situation they appear to be worthy people I think mu
much of them perhapse more for haveing been acquainted with you, he said you told
him you thought you should see him in Amrica in about one year from that 
time which was last April I count the time verry particularly up to that time
O my dear W. must I wait longer than that time to see you, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|br. Joseph]] says that the Lord does
not require a man to be from his family more than a year at one time. brother 
[[Orson Hyde|O. H Hyde]] and [[John Edward Page|J.E. Page]] have started on a mission to the Jews have been gone about 5 months 
and have not got near [[New York|N.Y.]] yet they are going to [[England|Eng.]] and then to constan
tinople, - if you do not get the [[Times and Seasons|times and seasons]] I would just say that there
is verry interesting letter in it from the Jews, it is lengthy and you would be high
ly edefied to have a perusal of the whole of it but I can only give you some items 
from it, They say the Lord has oppened the way where by they might get possession 
of their beloved citty and they lost no time but exerted themselves to rebuild their beloved 
citty and the undertakeing prospered in their hands so that they have completed
the Medrash and greate is the glory of the house and also of the houses of the teachers
of the law and they have authorized one Aaron Selig Ashkenazi to go forth with a 
proclamation to all their brethren soliciting them to come and assist them they 
seam greately rejoiced at their present prospects. There has been an Indian his wife
and daughter baptize in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] last April they were much pleased with the book
of mormon and said every word of it was true he was an interpreter for 6 tribes he 
said that his brethren would receive the work every one of them they come 6 or 7 
hundred miles to be acquainted with it. Brother Joseph has been dilivering a course 
of lectures of late upon the eternal judgment the eternity of matter &c &c I often thought 
how interesting they would have been to you as well as others he made it so plain 
that a child could understand it â the work is progressing in every part of America
but not as fast as in Eng. I showed your letters to brother Joseph there was quite a 
number present he to^ld^ them to give audience while the last one was red as I had 
shown him the others before they all gave attention and was much pleased with
the contents none more so than Joseph he wants me to let him see your letters which
I have done he says he would not leave his family so but would take them with him
if he took them on his back â The church began to build a house on the other side of 
the river ^for us^ but they do not think of finishing it this fall sister [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] has moved into 
her house on that side but it is not quite finished the body of ours is up to the roof and there
it stands sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor's]] is not finished sister Pratt had one bought for her â brother 
[[George Albert Smith|G.A. Smiths]] [[John Smith, b. 1781|father]] lives in our house in Lovely street I did think of moveing there this 
fall but expect now to stay where I am now untill you return as [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father Clark]] has 
made me welcome he says tell br. Woodruff I that he will take as good care of me as he can 
and he wants you to get as many souls as he can sends his respects likewise, â we 
have had a wedding in the family her[e] of late that sister [[Lurena Church Clark|Church]] that I mentioned in 
my March letter has lately been married to one of father Clarkâs sons [[John Wesley Clark|John Wesly]] 
the[y] send their respects to you likewise all the family. Sisterâs Young Taylor [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] 
Pratt Clark Turley and Hadlock and families are well likewise br G A Smiths fathers 
and family he wishes me to say for him that he has lately received a letter from 
him and answered the same. my he My health is quite good at present and has been 
since last june when the fever and ague left me little [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford Owen]] has got it now and 
it is hard for him but I think he will get over it hope so at least he and I needs 
a large share in your prayers that we may be supported by the grace of God. I have sold my 
youngest calf the cow does do as well this season as last. I should be muchfor 
pleased to have you get your likeness taken if you can. The next time you go to Eng. I want to go 
with you I have not forgotten your promis of staying at home 3 years after we were 
married and I presume you have not â yet when you come home we will talk about 
those things. I have not yet received those papers you mentioned the Millennial 
star but earnestly hope I shall as I feel anxious to see them. I feel verry sorry 
you do not get the times and seasons, I want you to write often. as brother William 
Clark wants to write some to you I must soon give way for him he will occupy 
the next page he is father Clarkâs oldest son at home and a worthy man so I must 
close by wishing you further prosperity and that the grace mercy and peace of 
God may rest upon and preserve you from all evil accidents and harm and enable 
you to fill your mission in meekness and the love and fear of God and return you 
safely to the bosom of your family is the daily prayer of your true friend
W. Woodruff [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|P.W. Woodruff]]
You sell tell me to kiss the children for you that I did verry often before little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] 
died and she used to kiss me many time for pa,pa, as she called you and a little before 
the breath left her body she kissed me for you and little Willo as she called him I wish 
you could have seen her she was much mor interesting the last 2 weeks of her life than 
before because she learned to talk much she possessed a lovely disposition you would 
have been pleased with it. I often kiss little Willford Owen for his pa. and think 
the poor child never had the privilege of seeing him but hope he will ere long - la it is 
said he resembles his mother much, he grew finely before he was sick. If you could 
get me a wrought muslin or lace cape I should be much pleased with it. If little 
Sarah could have lived I should have thought ^my^ troubles and afflictions were 
light but now I think they are serious. Please give my respects to all of the Amer
ican brethren and the Saints around you particularly to br. [[Thomas Kington|Kingston]] and family 
where you make it your home. So farewell dear W.

My Dear Willford,
With pleasure I seat myself at this time to 
acknowledge the reception of your kind letter which came to hand 10 days since
and I should have answered it immedately after its reception had it not been that my
babe was quite sick but he is better now I had been an[x]iously looking for a letter from you 
for a long time and to my greate satisfaction received it from the hand of a brother, brought 
by some of the brethren from [[England|Eng.]] on the 27th of Aug. 4 families arrived in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] from
Eng. and report says that 30 families more stopped in [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinata]] Ohio for a little season
to labour and obtain more means to bring them here. I was truly glad that you recei
ved that letter you spoke of that I sent you in march for I conclude you must feell verry
an^x^ious to hear from home judging you by myselfe for if I do not get a letter from you of
ten I get quite uneasey â this is the 7th letter I have sent you since you left N [[New York|N.Y.]] I have
taken much pains to write you since you left home and much lament that you have 
not received my letters, for I have written them verry full and one was a long sheet like your
mamoth sheet-filled full, I wrote you once in Jan. then in Mar. then in Apr. then 
in May then June then July then this in Sept â the April letter I sent by brother [[Orson Hyde|O. Hyde]] 
and [[John Edward Page|J. E. Page]], who who started soon after the April conference on a mission to the ^Jews^ via
of Eng and the one in july I sent by brother [[Lorenzo Snow|L. Snow]] containing an acount of Sarah
Emma death he expected to go d^i^rect to Eng. and I hope you have received that one this
time, one I directed to you in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] in the care of [[John Taylor, b. 1808|J. Taylor]] thinking you would be more 
likely to get it. You say you have sent me 4 letters since you arrived in Eng. I 
have received them all and they brought much news, and afforded me and others much
satisfaction for all the brethren and sisters seam anxious to hear from Eng. and I
with them rejoice with you much in the prosperity of the work with you and that the Lord is 
blessing you labours and the brethrenâs there - The work rolls on there swiftly but the 
time of your absence seames long to me it is 13 months today since I last saw you and it seames 
to me to be almost an age but I will try to wait patiently your return which I know will be as soon 
as the Lord^âs will^ is done with you there and did I not know that the Lord required you to be in his vine
yard I could not endure your absence but the Lord has promised strength equal to our day 
and I find he has fulfilled that promis to me, for I have been enabled the most of the time
to be contented and reconciled to my situation although I have had much sickness and a 
severe trial to pass through in looseing my little Sarah even in the absence of her father the little 
dear had no relatives to follow her to her grave but her mother and [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|little brother]] whome she
tenderly loved, she d there was quite a number of the brethren and sisters accompanyed me but
it was a peculiar trying scene for me, more so because of your absence she did not forget her pa,pa, 
for she used to call him many times in a day, but I trust she rests from the toils and 
troubles of this life. I have not heard from [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father Carter]] or [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father Woodruffs]] house
hold for sometime, but lately learned by a letter from br. [[Dwight Webster|D. Webster]] that [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] had late 
ly received a letter from you and that she had been unwell but was better, the others 
were well br. Webster went to the south in june in company with br. [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] as far 
as [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] he makes good progress in the work and is pleased with his calling 
br he thinks of spending the winter in the south if so he will be ordained an eld. and 
have charge over the churches there, thus writes br. Smoot to his [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|wife]] and says he 
and br W. has baptized 15 he (Smoot) is soon expected home and will bring his mother 
in law [[Esther Hunter McMeans|McMeanes]] with him he and his wife send their respects to you likewise 
br [[Albert Smith|Albert Smith]] and rejoices in the progress of the work with you also br. S. Smith 
and wife. Br. D. Webster spent a week with me in june I suppose you know
of the engagement between him and sister E. Woodruff he told me of it himselfe when
he was here. I think him to be a fine man and will make a worthy companion 
he wrote some in a letter that I was writing to you when he was here.
The siskness in Montrose and Commerce is not so greate as it was last season
but there has quite a number died this season some of which I know [[Seymour Brunson|Seymour Brunson]], 
widow [[Sarah Burt Beman|Beman]], [[Jonathan Harriman Holmes|J. Holmeâs]] [[Marietta Carter Holmes|wife]], [[John Portineus Greene|J.P. Greenâs]] [[Rhoda Young Greene|wife]], Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]], and [[Harriet Pamela Partridge|daughter]],
[[Sidney Rigdon|S. Rigdon]] and father [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] are verry low, and many others that I do not
know I had our little Sarah buried in Commerc and have got a picket fence around
it ^her grave^ painted white and trimed with black â I miss her company much. If you
have not received my letters there are many things that contained in them you
would like to hear our family matters &c. In my Jan letter I told you about my 
temporal affairs and situation and I have just written you a letter which I
shall not send you but shall keep it for you when you come home come home 
those are pleaseing words shall I ever realize them I hope to. I am now at 
[[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father Clarkâs]] where I have been since last Dec. they are verry kind to me and have been 
ever since I have been there he makes me welcome to stay here untill you come home there 
is a branch of the church here of about 50 and they are well united [[Ephraim Grant Luce|Ephraim Luce]] belongs 
to it and family N. Thoma's and family they wish to be remembered to you. Stephen 
Luce lives in Commerce - one part of it is call Nauvoo it is building up verry fast indeed 
they have appointed a stake on the west side of the river and [[Nashville, Jackson County, Iowa Territory|Nashvill]] is the place 
appointed to build up a citty. I have seen brother [[William Benbow|William Benbow]] from Eng. where 
you made it your home for 2 months when they were there and the little girls that used
to sleep with you, or the man of God as they called you, they were as much pleased to see me as
though we had always been acquainted I had a verry pleaseing visit with them they

Elder W. Woodruff asteemed
friend & friend brother I gladly imbrace the

you a few lines by way of compliment
altho writen on my knee in hast by reaso[n] [page torn]
of the press of bu[si]ness that is now waiti[ng] [page torn]
on me. I beleave that things remane much
as they was when you left. Sickness prevailes
and all buness seemes to have stoped for the present
Perhaps it may be said that the presidency
has bought upper [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] but what they give
for it I cannot say deffinetly. I would also informe
you that Govner [[Robert Lucas|Lucus]] of [[Iowa Territory|Ioway]] has sent
dow an exepress for [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and he is gone to see him
but what his buness is I persum is not known
It might be edefying or grattifying to you to
informe you that the fary at Commerce is
now in the hands of the bishops as I am cred
bly informed and President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] is fast
recvering from a serious attact of sickness
you have the first interest in my prayrsâ
most fervent, and I desire an interest in yours
I am sir as ever your most)
affecttionet Brotherâ ) A.O SmootYes I even begin to look forth for the day when I hope and trust that I
shall behold and embrace him whom I now feal to dedicate to the Lord know
ing his calling although it I think it the greatest sacrafice that I could
make to be deprived of the society and company of my nearest friend on earth
but I think that the grace of God is sufficient for all things even to raise
me from a bed of sickness and preserve me ^and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]]^ untill thy return which is
my sincere desire. Oh! Willford do not forget ^us^ when at the throne of grace
for we need as much grace to stand at this time of trial there are not
enough well people in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] to take care of the sick therefore
they suffer for want of attentionâmuch the same in [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]]
although some have died thereâand none in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] save a
number of children brother [[Parley Parker Pratt|Pratts]] was one of the numberâ well
when you left. There have about 53 of the brethren died in [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]]
and it continues verry sickly there yetâ brother [[Johnston F. Lane|Lane]] has lost both
of his children. brother [[Warren Smith|Warren Smith]]s wife is dead some of your
Southern acquaintanceâbrother [[Jeremiah Byrd Murphy|Jeremiah Murphy]] has been here from
[[Tennessee|Tennessee]] and wishes to be rem^e^mbered to you. I suppose that you
have learned the fate of our [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Island]] friends as I heared that you went
through [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]] was glad that you had an oppertunity of seeing
them. I received a book of brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylorâs]] writing from [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]]
with your marke or my name on it. was glad even to see that
I received a letter from home the day that you left home. the^i^r heath
was generally good accept sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss]] who was quite feeble and had been
for 2 months in consequence of lifting the old gentleman who lived with her
in his last illness he died last April. they sent much love to you and
the letter was d^i^rected to you. they much wished you ^to^ called and see
brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] in [[New York|N.Y.]] they feared that you would not know that he was
there. did not know that we had a paper from him. they wanted me
to come home and stay with them while you was gone. they wanted
you to call there on your return from [[England|England]]â Sister Foss would be
much pleased with a letter from you. do write me once a month for
they will seam long. I found the last page in your journal and read
it with interest. hope that you found a lock of my hair with some lines
in your trunk. Sarah sends a lock of her hair to you with a kiss by kissing
the letter. Shshe often calls pa-pa-pa- verry loudâdont you hear her. If
you have an oppertunity to get some wooling undershirts they would be much
better for you. I have been weighting to receive a a letter from you before I wrote
but feared if I weighted longer you would not get it before you left N.Y.Sept 19th 1839
Lovely-street as you named the place when here
Dear Willford
After waightining waiting 5 long weeks after you left me to
hear from you I take my pen although in a feeble state and on the bed
as you will perceive from my writing. I let [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] stay at [[Abraham Owen Smoot|brother Smoots]]
8 days after you left then she came home well and fleshy and bright she continued well
about 2 weeks and then I was taken with the fever and ague 3 or 4 days before she was.
we were then in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] and no one to do any thing for us as they were all sick
about there so that brother and [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|sister Smoot]] came out and mooved us to their
house and rendered us every assistanc they could although their house was
unfinished yet our accommodations were much better than in Montrose.
we have been quite low having had a shake every day but are both getti
ng better now. I was much rejoiced to hear of the improvement of your
health after you left by a man who saw ^you^ about 40 miles from here who said
that you requested him to call and see me. I was glad to hear from you any
way. much wonder that you do not write as you have always done before
I think that you have not time or the letter has miscaried or something has
happened. so good night my Willford hopeing that I shall feel better
in the morn. The morn has come and found me for the first time
without a chill or shake although I feal verry weak yet I think that
I am gaining health and Sarah to. The men have come to day to raise my
house I am in hopes that they will get it finished by the time that I am
able to go into it their has been some talk of sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Tailorâs]] going in with
me as she had to move out of brother [[Brigham Young|Youngs]] house she went into my room
with sister [[Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt|Pratt]] while I am out here. Sister Taylor wants to come
out into this neighbourhood she is a good neighbour. but the family you
left with me Oh! dear! if I had expected the time had been long that I 
should have dwealt there I should have sent for you to have come home
for I could not have staid in the house with any contentmentâ but
thank the Lord I have not for the frirst moment wished you at home
since you left but desired and prayed for your spead and success on
your mission, Yea that you might have strength both temporal and spi
ritual wisdom grace knowledge humility and understanding to pres
erve you from all evil and help you fill your mission in the love
and fear of God and have many souls as seals of your ministry
I hope to do better next time  [[Jonathan Harriman Holmes|Homes]] has lost his [[Marietta Carter Holmes|wife]], and [[Mary Emma Holmes|babe]] about 3 months old, O The church have 
bought a steamboat and have got it running on the riverâ they gave 4000 
dolls. for it. Brother [[William Van Ausdall|Vanosdel]] has been appointed chief magistrate this season 
Brother [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdons]] health is verry poor. I am weighting for you to come home before 
[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emmas]] funeral sermon is preached or [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford O.]] is blest. Please Tell Brother G. A. 
Smith that his [[Clarissa Lyman Smith|mother]] and [[Caroline Clara Smith Callister|sister]] have been sick but are now quite smart like

[[Iowa Territory|Iowa T.Y.]] Oct 6th to 19th 1840
& W.O. Woodruff
Answered London Jan 13th 1841all be restored again.â Paul says I die da^i^ly [[Joseph Smith Jr.|brother Joseph]] says that he actually 
died and was raised to life againâ says the beasts that he fought with at Epesus often 
killed him and he came to life againâ if so Willford why may not our little 
[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] be raised to life againâ He, brother Joseph has brought forth many new 
things this season.â There has been quite a number of deaths in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] 
the past season I believed that I mentioned some of them in my last 
letter to you [[Seymour Brunson|Seymour Brunson]], he was buried under armesâ bishop he said that 
brother [[David Wyman Patten|D. Patten]] was calling him and desired brother Joseph to let him go for 
he needed himâ likewise bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] is dead and his wife is married again to 
[[William Huntington, b. 1784|father Huntingdon]] who lost his wife last fall â [[Sarah Burt Beman|Mother Beanam]]â father John Jo 
[[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Smith]] the patriarch a little previous to his death he called his children around 
him and blessed them and appointed [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]] Patriarch in his steadâ There are 
many things I have mentioned in my other letters to you which would be 
interesting to you which I could mention if you have not received them. 
such as some of the brethrenâs going among the Indians, I saw two of them 
on the 2nd of this month and they said the prospects were good - last April 
there was an Indian his wife and daughter baptized in Commerce.â I have 
not heard from [[Maine|Main]] or [[Connecticut|Connecticut]] since I wrote you last. - Did you 
know that [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|brother Ilus]] in [[New York|N. Y.]] was marriedâ Brother [[Dwight Webster|Dwite Webster]] 
came here in june and went to the south with [[Abraham Owen Smoot|brother Smoot]] & 
expects to spend the winter in [[Tennessee|Ten.]] brother Smoot has ordained him an 
elder and given him charge over the churches there, he makes great pro
ficiency in the ministryâ brother Smoot has got home and with his wife sends 
his respects to you [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Sister Smoot]] says to tell brother Woodruff not to forget my hymn book 
and while you are thinking of hers remember that I have no hymn book or bible.
Brother [[John Herrett|John Herrett]] has been walking in your steps even on the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|fox islands]] 
with some other elders and there has been quite a stir among the people there again 
and there has about as many come into the church lately us when you was 
thereâ sister [[Jane Herrett|Jane Herrett]] say give my respects to br Woodruff I have lately had 
a letter from herâ I have lately seen sister [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|Bently]] she that ^was^ sister Pattin she says 
give my love to brother Woodruff and tell him he knows that I love him with 
all my hart, her health is poor and she desires the prayrs of all that quorum 
that it may not turn with her as it did with brother [[Parley Parker Pratt|Pratts]] first wife in her 
last day but that she may be spared through it and do good on the earth
she wants that little portrait of brother Pattins which you have as she has n[one]
I [page torn] you to get your portrait painted if you can convenientlyâ a[page torn]
if you [page torn] [ca]n get me a wrought black lace veil I should like it much and [page torn]
cape and collar I should be much pleased as they come much cheaper the[page torn] 
here. The families of the 12 have rather snug times to get along hereâ brother 
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] was a wise man to build his house and get his family into it before he 
left them. I have seen [[Sister Moon|sister Moon]] [[Sister Sutton|sister Sutton]] and another sister from [[England|Eng]] I 
have forgotten her name they were from [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] they have seen you all. 
I was glad to see them. I read some of your letters to them they were 
much pleased with them. Please give my respects to brother Kimbal and 
all the quorum that are there likewise all the saints around you.
19th Yesterday Sunday, we had an interesting sermon we had an interesting
subjec upon the living's being baptized for the dead it was made so plain that none 
could dispute it reasonably and I should be glad to be baptized for my grandparents 
and some others but want to wait for you to do it would it not be best, I had ra
ther you would do it than any person living.â Sister [[Hannah Mercey Currier Swasey|Swasey]] one of my good 
neighbours sends her respects to you and says tell brother Woodruff that she wants 
him to come home for my sake. I am now at [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father Clark]]s and think I shall 
stay here untill you come home. I am comfortable here and if I want any thing 
can call on brother [[William Oglesby Clark|William Clark]] who wrote to you in my other letter makeing 
a covenant with you that he would supply my needs and wants untill you 
come home, He is a fine young manâ belongs to the 70s and is father Clarks oldest 
son at home he know you and says he is some acquainted with youâ therefore 
give yourselfe no uneasiness about my temporal wants but give me and our 
[[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|babe]] an interest in your prayrs. I fell anxious to see my presents you spoke of 
in your last letterâ Ah! what shall I do when those little shoes come for Sarah 
I donât know sometimes how to bear her loss it seames as though I cannot endure 
it, but I must stop for it seems line a neverending subject for me to speak or 
write on. Sister [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] and [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] received some very pretty presents I saw 
them when I was there they (like me) thought much of them; more on account 
of their comeing from their husbands â If you could get some articles of clothing for 
your family it would be quite acceptableâ the sister who gave you the bed in N. Y.
apostatized in about 2 weeks after so [[Sister Stone|sister Stone]] told me from N. Y. Sarah 
Milliken is not married yet but expects to be to a man out of the Church she 
is in Commerce.â [[Aphia S. Woodman|Aphia Woodman]] has sent a letter to Sarah Milliken asking 
her advice and mine about coming west with [[Milton Holmes|Milton]] she is about 60 miles east of 
[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father Carter]]s with her brother - Milton has lately sent here to know who of the 
brethren are going to Eng. this fall and when they will be in N.Y. so it appears that 
he is thinking of going but there are none who are thinking of going from here this 
fall, I hear that brother Joseph dont think it is best for them to go. Brother [[Jonathan Harriman Holmes|Johnathan]]
came from a distance, we had a address from our prophet after which it was 
voted that [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] should be built up and three ^one^ man was appointed to preside 
over it I think they ^it^ was brother [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Almon Babbit]] [[Oliver Granger|father Granger]] & brother [[Elias Higbee|Higby]] 
âthen it was motioned that a committee be appointed and commissioned to 
appoint & lay up stakes for the gathering ^from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] to Kirtland.^â [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram Smith]] [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Whight]] 
and Judge Higby were chosenâ then they proposed building the Lord's 
house by tytheing the people they commen^ce^ to collect materials this fall and begin to 
build next springâ the people meet togather and work every tenth day 
br. [[Reynolds Cahoon|R. Cayhoon]] H. Smith & one more were appointed for the committee â the house 
is to 100 feet by 120 and much other business was done the meeting closed 
by an address from [[John Cook Bennett|Dr. Bennet]] (a quarter master general who has lately been 
baptized) upon the subject of war. And by his talk you wo^u^ld conclude they
that the brethren expected war with [[Missouri|Missourie]] sometime â he is a great orator.
4 th Sun. meeting commenced to day at 9 oclock and it was judged that 
there was 5000 people on the ground. I shall not particularize the business of 
this day or the morrow for my [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|babe]] was quite troublesom which took my at
tention much, 5th. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|brother Joseph]] was expected to preach today on the Priest
hood but his health would not admit of it so A. Babbit took the stand and 
delivered an interesting discourse upon the same subject.â yesterday brother Joseph spoke 
a short time from 29 verse of the 15 chap. of first Cor. of which I will here after speak
& this afternoon brother L. White spoke on the same subject which was very interes
ting. To-day we hear that brother [[Theodore Turley|Turly]] and his company are within 2 or three days 
journey of here, and I stopped a week, to see them expecting to hear from you by then 
spent most of the time with sister [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] she sends her respects to youâ  She and
family are well likewise sister [[Mary Ann Frost Pratt|Pratt]] & child I went to see sister [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] She was not verry 
well but was getting better, [[Elizabeth Young, b. 1825|Elizabeth]], and [[Vilate Young, b. 1830|Vilate]] have been sick but are betterâ sister 
[[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] & family are comfortably wellâ likewise sister [[Polly Keeler Clark|Clark]] & [[Frances Amelia Kimberley Turley|Turleys]] family's also 
[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister Woodruff]] is comfortably as to health but her babe is not well. It has got now to be 
the 15th of the month and brother Turley has not yet arrived here â I see my subjects and 
sentences are verry broken but if you knew how I have to write you would not think 
it strange, for I often have to leave my pen every minute and take the babe ^and^ but have to 
write with him in my lap so that I make but poor headway about this business,â 
although my sentences are more broken & disconnected than they otherwise would 
by reason of my little son, I do not consider it any task to take care of him and 
presume you will excuse me for these reasons and to ask the Lord to spare him for 
future usefulness and for a comfort to his parents.â I feel that without my babe I 
should be miserable indeed â yes much more lonely than at now - you cannot think how
much I miss little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] her death has disarmed me of all courage faith & 
fortitude, I have had almost one scene of trouble since you left me by sickness &c but 
I ^feel^ as though they were all light afflictions when compared with that â O pray for 
me Willford that I may have grace and strength equal to my day - for I feel like a 
lonely child on the earth now but I endure it as for Christ sake knowing that nothing 
but a sense of duty to our heavenly ^father^ would cause us to part with the enjoyment of each of 
each others society; but I will try to be patient and take as good care of our little lad as
I can untill you return, which I pray God may be soon, for it seames that you 
have been gone an age,â  Only ^think^ most 15 months, do tell me something about when 
you think of comeing HOME - Well I have wandered far from my subject the 
conference, it hend 3 days and closed on the 5th (Monday) and I returned home after 
spending a week in Commerce - We had a verry interesting conference and often did I 
wish that Yo you and your quorum could have the privilege of being there. 16th today
I hear that the brethren have commenced to draw stone for the meetinghouse. Now a few 
words from Brother Joseph sermon on the livingâs being baptized for the dead that they 
may be judged according to men in the flesh; he has learned by revelation that those in 
this church may be baptized for any of their relatives who are dead and had not a 
privalege privaledge of hearing it this gospel even for their children, parents, bothers, sisters, 
grandparents, uncles, & aunts,â but not for acquaintances unless they send a mi
nistering spirit to their friends on earth,â as soon as they are baptized for their 
friends they are released from prison and they can claim them in the resurrection
and bring them into the celestial kingdomâ this doctrin is cord^i^ally received by the church 
and they are going forward in multitudes, some are going to be baptized as many as 
16 timesâ they have to be baptized and confirmed separately for every friendâ once 
in one dayâ How many can a spirit be baptized whâ why not deputize a friend on earth 
to do it for themâ [[John Wesley Clark|John Wesly]] can receive this work but how can his spirit be 
baptize in waterâ It is the privilege of the oldest one in a family to be baptized 
for their friends if they desire it but they can give it to another if they choose 
Brother Joseph makes this doctrin look verry plain and consistenâ he 
has been bringing strange things forward to the church this seasonâ strong 
meatâ he has delivered a course of lectures this season which were verry 
interestingâ I could not attend only apart of the time but often wished you 
could be presentâ  he says that the throne of God stands on the earth like this earth 
only it is cleansed &c &câ says that this earth is the wickedest planate that ever God made 
and that its inhabitants are will have the greatest glory if they overcome evilâ and 
that it was the largest when made but at different times there has been parts 
taken from it, for instance when the ten tribes were lost and says they will[[Lee County, Iowa Territory|Lee County]] Iowa Territory, Sept. 6th ^Oct 6th^ 1840
My Dear Companion
To day I came down to the Hawly settle
ment and there I received a letter from you which I had long looked for, it
afforded the pleaseing of your health inteligence of your health and prosperity in 
the gospel and many kind words to the childrenâ the former I was much pleased
to hear but the latter even those to [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] were like daggers to my heart think
ing She was torn from my embrace and laid in the silent grave when she could not 
receive a kiss for her pa, or a fathers blessing but just previous to the departure
of her spirit from her body, she left a kiss with me for her pa, pa, whome ^she^ called many times 
in dayâ the little dear was not permitted to see you after you left her in her little
carriage at brother [[Pierce Hawley|hawly]]âs door. I often think of her traveling from [[Maine|Maine]] with
us though that toilsome journey and of her suffering with me in my cold house in
Lovely street when we were both sick, and suffered much for want of wood &
fire I could not sit up all day and was verry feeble and alone she was sick & 
had to crawl about on the cold floor alone these things grieve me, but she has gone, 
her deposition was to lovely to long remaine long on the earth her spirit to pure to mingle 
with the spirits of the earth a more affectionate kind and lovely disposition never 
inhabited a human brest than she possessed & I was anxious for the time to come that 
I could teach her the things of the kingdom of God.
Ah! Sarahâs goneâDear BabeâHer journeyâs ore! 
She breathe'dâ she wept.â but she shall weep no more. 
How short her time by providence assigned! 
About 2 years she was on earth confine'd! 
Angelic bands her spirit did convey, 
To happier realmes in everlasting day:
Our lovely child has first arrived at home, 
to see the splendor of the eternal throne. 
And shout us welcome to the promised land. 
Our SarahâLovely BabeâHer infant frame, 
No more shall feel the smart of mortal pain,
She only sleeps! Though motionless she lies.
Her sacred dust, refined, again shall rise, 
to shine in bliss most exquisitly bright, 
Surpassing far the sunâs refulgent light. 
And is she dead? O no! She entered life 
the moment she escaped this world of strife:
Sheâs now from earth removed, her soul expands, 
And by the throne in holy rapture stands; 
Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streames, 
And basks unsully' delighted, in unsullyâd beames;
Now hears with wonder the melodious strain, 
And joins to celebrate Mesiahâs name; 
Her mind illumined now with glad surprise, 
Sees happier worlds, unseen from mortal eyes. 
She now perhaps ^from^ Zionâs hight sublime 
Looks down and views the simple things of time; 
Or, if permited, to the earth descends, 
And gladly mingles with her earthly friends; 
Although unsee her happy spirit near,
May hear the sigh, and see the falling tear, 
May with concern behold maternal grief, 
And fondly wish to sooth and give relief.
On the 15th I received another letter 
dated july 8th, which also bore
pleasing inteligence of your 
health and prosperity and 
also of the brethren with you. 
The friends flock around to hear 
your letters and seam much inter
ested in them. I send them to 
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] to read as he wants to 
see them. Perhapse you may 
think that I have forgotten to 
tell you anything about our little 
[[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford Owen]], O no, for he is now 
in my lap pulling & scratching 
round so that I can hardly write. 
he has just ^torn^ up the almenack before 
I saw what he was doing, he grows 
finely considering the sickness he has 
had, has been sick much of the time 
since he was born, he has the chills & 
fever now. He is now reaching 
and trying to get my pen I will 
give it him and see what he 
will write. [In Wilford Jr.âs handwriting] Dear pa pa do come 
home and see me I want to see you 
Dear wants to see you to, she often 
cries about it. W. O. Woodruff. 
Thus he has written some to his 
pa pa himself they say the it is 
said that fools and children tell 
the truthâ Enough of this.â 
I have thought of not writing to you 
any more for two reasons one is 
I fear that you will not get them 
and another is I heard that our letters 
were oppened before you get them by a set of men, but I trust your good sense will 
cause you not to have my weak letters exposed for they are designed for no eye but yours. 
I have received all the letters you mentioned haveing written and they have affor
ded me much satisfaction, & sometimes I get quite lonely and disconsolat then the reception of 
a letter cheers me up and I live hopeing that the time will come that you may be retu
rned home once more, this is the 8th letter I have sent you since you have been in 
[[England|Eng.]] and paid the postage on them to [[New York|N.Y.]] I regret verry much that you do not get
more of them. My health is comfortably goodâ I was verry glad yours was so 
good. We hear that brother [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] has taken his family to Eng. But brother Joseph does 
not approve of it I hear.  When I commenced this letter I thought I would keep 
a little kind of a journal untill after the conference on the 2nd of Oct. I attended the con
ference though from the beginning I will give you some items of it as my mem
ory serves me and in my next letter will coppy the minutes as you do not get the papers 
should have done so now but Brother [[Robert Blashel Thompson|R Thompson]] had not got them made out 
yetâ The [illegible] conference commence was appointed the 2[nd] of Oct but in consequence 
of bad weather they did not meet 3rd to-day there was a large assembly many brethren[stamp in red ink] 6 Ev 6

Answered London Jan 13th 1841 [[Mary Ann Frost Pratt|sister Parly Pratt]] has got to [[England|Eng.]] before this time I should 
like to be there myselfe well. I suppose that all 
of the sisters in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] will write by the bearer of this 
they are all well I believe I mentioned in 2 or 
3 of my letters to you that if you could get me a black 
lace wrought veil and a wrought lace cape and collar 
I should be much pleased as they are much cheaper there 
than here but if not convenient let it go. I really 
hope you will get my letters for I took the utmost 
pains to write to you I am comfortable here now

I shall do but believe me when I say that the families

it should cause uneasiness. I would tell you some 
more things but I fear that some one will see it.

I know you do 
Yours as ever

The church is prospering well here 
never betterâ they have bought 
a steam boat and gave 4000 
dolls. for it and it is running 
on the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] 
scribbling indeed 
cant stop to read
what I have writtenNov. 1st. today we have had a good meetting at father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clarks]] where I liveâ there 
is a branch of the church here of about 50 members my name with [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] 
& [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willfordâs]] are enroled in this branchâ brother [[William Oglesby Clark|Wm. Clark]] is the president of this 
branch has gone to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] or [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] today and says that I must preside over the 
meeting todayâ there are a number of elders here and I would like to have some 
of them take your place a while and let you be at home with me and Willford 
Owen, O poor little is gone Sarah is gone how can I bear itâ hard hard indeed, O
tell me Willford why she was taken from me when you was gone it seames some 
times that I can hardly help murmering at itâ she was the was the pride and 
joy of my heart in my lonely moment and her sweet disposition rendered her lovely 
to all around herâ Willford Owen is not near as pretty as she was â just befor she 
died she left a kiss with me for her pa, pa. I had like to have forgotten to tell you that 
on the 29th I received a letter from sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice Woodruff]] they were well then and men
tioned haveing received a communication from you dated july 10 they have received 
3 letters from youâ they have lately had news of uncle [[Joseph Hart, b. 1787|Joseph Harts]] death of [[Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts|Springfield]] 
he died about the middle of Sept. I think with the billious feverâ as Eunice said her 
[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]] was writing to you I suppose she will give you the particulars of his death 
Eunice is not diffident about her connexion with br. [[Dwight Webster|Webster]] she writes verry plain 
to me on the subjectâ says she feels as though she was writing to a sister. 
She says uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]] will probably move west in the course of a year or twoâ she 
appears strong in the faith.
2nd I have just this minute heard of an opportunity of sending 
to you safely I therefore leave my breakfast partly eaten and 
commence to write a little more in my letter thinking that 
apart of a sheet will be better than none ^to you^ if your feelings are 
like mine in regard to hearing from youâ my health and 
Willford Owenâs is good this morn. I dont know as you like 
the addition of Owen to his name but sister [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Smoot]] much desired 
it. I told you in my last letter which I mailed about 
ten days since that I would send you the minutes of the 
conference in it but as I have not got them and suppose that 
brother [[Robert Blashel Thompson|Thompson]] will send them I defer it. I have not 
received the papers from you should be much pleased toâ 
We have just received the Sept. paper it contains the most 
of one of your letters and little Sarah death in it and I hope you 
will get it by the bearer of this. I have received all the letters 
from you that you spoke of and this is the 9th one that I have 
sent you since you have been in [[England|Eng]]. I long want much 
to hear from you again hopeing you will tell me something 
about comeing home. I expect to hear by br. [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] as you 
mentioned writing by him and I want to see those articles 
much because they come from you. Brother [[John Edward Page|Page]] & [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] 
left here last April on a mission, to the Jews they were exp
ecting to go first to the jews in [[New York|N. Y.]] then to those in Eng 
from thence to Constantinople â they are preaching 
by the way to get means to carry them though they 
dont think of leaveing America with 1000 dolls. each 
we have not heard as they have got to NY yet I expect[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] Lee County Iowa Terr. Oct. 25th 1840
My Dearest Willford
I have just sent a full sheet to 
the office for you and think I will begin another now and 
keep a kind of a journal or sketch of times and things with me 
untill I hear from you again. Today we have had a good meet
ing at father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clarkâs]] where I live and just as meeting closed 
brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] rode up to the door this is the first time. I have 
seen him since his return from his missionâ he has been 
gone about 4 months and been into the states of [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] [[Alabama|Alabama]]
&c. and has baptized in company with br. [[Dwight Webster|D. Webster]] about 26 and or
dained him an elder and given him charge over the church in 
Ten. about 200 miles from where you traveledâ br Smoot took 
supper with me and I think you would have been a welcome guest 
at the table he says that br. Webster has got to be a workman and 
thinks of returning to [[Connecticut|Con.]] in march and settleing up his busines 
and comeing west as soon as he can. 26th today I feel lonely but 
comfort myselfe with thinking that W. will come home and sure 
ly he will not get away so again without I go toâ you speak 
about [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willfordâs]] growing fast so as to go into the vinyard, I think 
he will be large enough by the next time you want to go so you 
can take him along at least I want you to. 27th today I have 
had a tried day my babe has been verry sick he still has the chills 
and fever verry hard and today I got quite alarmed about him
his fever ran so high but at night he is better I have broke his fever 
4 times with Sappingtonâs pills but it will return. 28th today 
I have felt quite comfortable my babe has been considerable smart.
I thought I would write you a little every night just before I 
retired to rest and let you know a little of the occurrences of the 
day with me. 29th today I am makeing a vest for brother [[Abraham Washburn|Washburn]] 
toward paying for a pair of shoes as I am much in want of them I

my babe and other chores 31st I feel quite well in mind today after

[[Sarah Carter Scammans|daughter]] 13 days older than my [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|babe]]. brother [[Luther Scammans|Luther]] wants to come to the west but sister R
does not. Did you know of the correspondence between brother [[Dwight Webster|Webster]] and sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] I
knew nothing of it untill he came here [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother Woodruff]] hinted someting of the kind in
her letter and Eunice sent me word to receive him as a particular friend of her's. and
then brother Webster told me of it himselfe he expects to take on himselfe the yoke of matrim
ony with sister Eunice a soon after his return from this mission. I think that he
will make an agreeable companion. he is a pleasant man and has an enquiring mind and
seames to gain much faith and strength by converseing and becomeing acquainted with
the brethren I think after he gets some more experience he will make a verry useful man.
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]] has not yet retirned from [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]. suppose he is on his way. has been verry sick
on the way. The brethren are about trying to redeem [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] those who hold claim on
it will take land in [[Canada, British North America|canada]] and the church here will give them land here for their
possessions in canada I have lately heard that one brother [[Lyman Stoddard|Stodard]] formerly from there
was going back to see them about it. I often think that I should like to be with you a 
while and see how are getting along. If you could look over here in a rolling prairie near the
timber into a little small house with one door in it you might see me verry often
[paper torn]ing my little [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|boy]] in my armes and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] clinging on to the rocker of my chair so that
[paper torn]may rock a little with us singing pa-pa  ma-ma and bilo [paper torn]boy or Willo as
she calls him.â I find my little ones are much company fo[paper torn] I had almost
forgotten to tell you that we heard that the Indanâs had been into two counties in
[[Missouri|Missourie]] and made them pay them taxes on the land. it is said that the Misso
urians fear the Indians much. Mr. [[Samuel Bogart|Bogart]] the capt. of the Missourie mob shot
[[Alexander Beattie|a man]] their election day and he lived but a few hours. has had his trial and is to be
hung the 4th of next july. thus I suppose his career will be ended for this life.
Many of the brother are fearful of the Indianâs comeing on [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] side of the
river and killing them but I feal verry easey about it myselfe although I have no
Willford to look out for me. I believe my trust is in the Lord and I think that he
will protect me. 24th Saturday eve. our family are in comfortable health and tomorrow
I expect to go to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] to hear [[Joseph Smith Jr.|brother Joseph]] preach on the resurrection
[[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Sister Taylor]] has recently received a letter from [[John Taylor, b. 1808|brother Taylor]] wherein he says that you
baptize 32 persons one week and 13 of them were methodist preachers. glad to hear of
your success. Just heard that there was a letter in the office for me. hope it is so. write
often. dreamed last night of seeing and asking you when you was comeing home thought

those who love our Lord Jesus Christ. must give way for brother Webster. May grace mercy and
peace rest upon you forever in is the prayr of your companion
Willford Woodruff. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|P.W. Woodruff]]
[Brother Websterâs writing]
Dear Brother in the Lord
Mrs Woodruff has presented me this sheet with the
privilege of communicating a few lines therein to you, which I thankfully embrace. by this
you will conclude that I am at the west, which is the case. I left [[Connecticut|Con]] the 19 of April
and after a journey of 21 dayays I arived at Montrose from thence to this place. I
expect to remain here with the Church a short time, & than take a Mission to the east. I
am glad to find the Church in a prosperous situation which I think is the case. the news the
particulars I suppoase your Wife will communicate to you. there are many convinceing proofs
o that Israel will soon return and Zion be redeemed. I still remain a believer in the worck
although not exempt from temptation. yet throug faith in Christ I expect to conquer and gain
a Crown of life may the worck of God roal forward untill the kingdom and the greatness therof shall
be given to the Saints. pray for me. may the Love of God be with you. With the respects
of Dwight Webster, Your Brother in the Lord.I do not know as you can find out this letter for I have to write it mostly with [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|my babe]]
in my armes and little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] around me â she calls aloud for pa-pa many times in a day
but the poor child has no pa to hear her. she is quite lonely like myselfe can you not tell me some
thing near when you shall y come home I shall look for you in the fall. I have written you
three letters before this since you left this continent and d^i^rected them to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston, Lankinshire, Eng.]]
and received 2 from you one dated Jan. 12th the other 27th - I should have written you oftener but
my circumstances would not admit of it â it was not for the want of fealing or anx
iety about you for believe me the society of no friends can fill the place of Willford in my heart
for I feal verry lonely of times Yes the briny flood will oft times overflow its banks in spite
of all my endeavours to restrain it but I know that it is the will of God that my compan
ion should labour in the vineyard of the Lord therefore I have tried to be reconciled to the will
of God in all things â I have not been left to murmer or complain once since you left me
but am looking forward to the day when you shall return home once more haveing filled
your mission in the love and fear of God. You are always present with me when I go
before the throne of grace and when I am asking for protection and blessings for myselfe and little
ones I claim a large one for my dear Willford who has gone far far from me even to a foreign
nation where he is exposed to all the scoffs of those who realize not the inportance importance of the things
of God and the dangers attached there untoâ O may the spirit of humility wisdom grace peace and
truth ever rest upon you is the prayr of your [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] who much desires to see you but cannot
at present. Sarah Emma and little Willford Jun Jr. wrote to you in the letter I sent you by brot
her [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] I hope you will obtain the letters I have sent you for I mentioned many things
in them relative to my situation. I am now at father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clarkâs]] whome I mentioned in my other
letter am living by myselfe and think of staying here untill fall they are verry kind to me.
I have a girl with me that works for me a part of the time and for herselfe some â [paper damaged]
got along quite comfortable since I came to father Clarks for help food and raime[nt] [paper damaged]
requested me to tell you particulars I would say that my cow has not yet come in [paper damaged]
the calfe you left with me I kept it (although they were not much pleased with it in brother
[[Pierce Hawley|Hawly]]âs [[Hawley's Grove, Lee County, Iowa|neighbourhood]]) because you desired me to before you left I have 2 hens and 12 chickens
they compose my stock at present. I hear that brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] is expecting to have some houses built
in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] for the families of the 12 Commerce is building up surprizeingly â the emigration
there is said to be much greater than it ever was in [[Caldwell County, Missouri|Caldwell County]], and the work is rolling
on in America with much rapidity â am glad to hear of its progress in [[England|England]] â pitty the
poor people in Eng. â I hope the saints will be patient and weight untill the Lord delivers them
which he will do in his own time and way. I suppose that you get the [[Times and Seasons|times and seasons]] as the Editors
said they sent each of the 12 a paper and by them you will learn of our brethrens success at Congress
and many other things perhapse more correctly than I could inform you. Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] has
lately lost [[Harriet Pamela Partridge|a daughter]] 18 years of age. â brothter [[Jeremiah Byrd Murphy|Murphy]] of [[Tennessee|Tennesse]] whome you used to be acquainted
there came to lovely street stoped a while then returned to his family and lived but 4 days
afterwards. Sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] &[[Parley Parker Pratt|P Pratts]] familieâs are well. â Sister [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] is troubled some
with the ague and I have it every little while. We have lately heard that there has been a battle
fought in [[Maine|Maine]] between the British and Americans about the boundary line and the Governors son
was killed how it will end I know not â the British requested the Americans to give up the
disputed land forth with but they refuse to do it therefore they are fulfilling the prophecies ancient
and modern. We have heard of no accident happening to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|N. Orleans]] â there has been much
destruction of the shipping in this country the past winter and spring â think it must have surp
rized the people much to have seen that light and the earth rise as you mentioned in
your letter. [[Ephraim Grant Luce|Ephraim Luce]] and [[Stephen Grant Luce|Stephen]] have a standing with the 70 seventies â brother Stephen
is expecting to go out on a mission this season â his [[Malatiah Luce|father]] and [[Ruth Luce|mother]] is expected here this sea
son â she that was [[Melana Ames|Melana Ames]] and [[Mary Ames|Mary Ames]] have come back to the church. [[Justus Ames|Brother]]
and [[Betsey Hudson Ames|sister Ames]] have sent for me to come and stay with them untill you return they
live about 60 miles from Commerce â [[Rufus Ames|Rufus]] has been baptised their son â and [[Valentine Ames|Volentine]] has as
much as he can do to get along with his family â lives on the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|south Island]]. Mr Mulliner is very
believing yet in this work and it is thought that he will be baptized â brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] talks of going
on to [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|the Islands]] this season â I expect that [[Sarah Milliken|Sarah Milliken]] will marry a man[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] [[Lee County, Iowa Territory|Lee County]] May 9th 1840
My Dear Willford
Think me not negligent in answering your letter when I tell you
you that it about 3 weeks since I received your last communication which I was truly glad
to get and perused it with much satisfactionâ the most of my time since your letter came to hand
has been devoted to the care of [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|my babe]] for the destroyer has tried hard to get him from me but I feell
as though I had the best right to him and I claimed him at the hand of God and he was pleased to
spare him unto me which I consider to be another token that he has not forgotten meâ may
I ever be thankful for his mercies to meâ he was taken with the hooping cough and then the croup
(which is prestness for breath) set in which brought him to the gates of death â O! thought I how
can I give up my babe even in in the absence of his father who had never seen him I felt as thou
gh I could not endure it so I and one of the sisters that lives near me took hold on faith with
all the powers of mind that we could muster and the Lord heard and answered usâ she s^t^aid with
me and was a greate comfort to meâ  you do not know her she has lately moved into the neigh
bourhoodâ so he is as well as can be expected with the hooping coughâ he had the croup which is generally
mortal with childrenâ [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] has been verry well this winter but some unwell of late but
is getting betterâ My health would be quite good if I did not have to be broken of my rest with my babe
so much as at the present but hope that he will soon be better of his cough
[Lydia Luceâs handwriting]
Dear Brother, Through the blessing of kind heaven I am permited the privilege of siting
at Sister [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe's]] table to write a few lines to you to let you know that we have
not forgotten you, my family is in good health and spirits and we hope soon to be
^setled^ in this vicinity, where we may have the privileg of visiting your family occasealy
we often think of you and would be glad to have a personal interview with
you, but we know that the Kings business must be attend to, we pray therefore
[page damaged] [illegible] Lord of the harvest to prepare you for the work that lays before you
[page damaged] [h]asten your mission, that you may soon accomplist the work whereunto
[page damaged]nt and return in peace and safety to the boosom of your family
[page damaged]e accept these few lines as a token of friendship from your friend and sister in the
new and everlasting covnant [[Lydia Maria Macomber Luce|Lydia M Luce]]
[Phebe's handwriting]
As my babe commenced crying and sister Luce sat by me I invited her to improve the time in writing
to you as she had expressed a desire previously to do so while I attended to himâ they have just moved from
[[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] and are liveing in the house with me untill they can locate themselves somewhere elseâ Brother
[[Stephen Grant Luce|Stephen Luce]] left [[North Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|the Island]] the 8th of last Oct. and arrived in [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]] 15th Jan. and [[Sarah Grant Luce Perry|Sarah Luce]] with
him she is married to [[Napoleon Perry|a man out of the church]]â Brother [[Albert Smith|Smith]], [[Isaac Carter Odekirk|Outerkerk]], and the two brother Luceâs are
in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] and [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]]. The 6th of April there was a conference held in Commerce which continued
nearly a week there was upwards of 70 baptized and ordained Elders and the church made their appe
al to heaven for redress of their wrongs and much business was transacted during the meeting. Brothers [[John Edward Page|Page]]
and [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] started a few days after it closed on a mission to the Jews, they go first to the Jews in [[New York|N. Y.]] and
then procede on brother Hyde has a letter for you as I thought he was going direct to [[England|England]] hope
that you will get it for I wrote about many things in itâ the work is rolling on here with rapi
dity in this country as much so and more than it ever has since the foundation of the church.
There has been an Indian and his wife and daughte baptized in Commerce a few days since they came
some hundreds of miles to become acquainted with the work they believed and embraced it joyfu
lly they said every word of the book of mormon was true â he was an enterpreter to six tribes.
and he said that every one of his brethren would receive it he knew it would be so â two Elder with
their families (brother [[John Lowe Butler|Butler]] and [[James Emmett|Emmit]]) have gone out among the Indians on a mission. Doctor
[[Isaac Galland|Gallund]] has returned from his mission I think he started just before you left Montrose and has
brought 60 families with him and expects it is said 200 families more soon. I have lately received a
letter from [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother Woodruff]] brought me by brother [[Dwight Webster|Dwite Webster]] he is now at my house and has
been here about a week I expect to go this afternoon to brother [[Pierce Hawley|Hawleyâs]] [[Hawley's Grove, Lee County, Iowa|settlement]] ^with him^ he appears
to be a worthy brother. Mother Woodruff was well and family she mentioned haveing received
a letter from you since you arrived in England. [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Father]] and [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother Carter]] has writen to me
lately they were all well their they want you to come and see them when you return, father tells
me whenever I am in want of any thing to come to him and I shall find an asylem
there â sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss]] much desires to moove to the west.
May 22nd I have been down to brother Hawleys neighbourhood and found them all well except brother
[[Samuel Harrison Smith|S Smith]]âs [[Mary Bailey Smith|wife]] she is quite low. Old Father [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] lives in our house there â he is
a good old gentleman - brother [[Albert Smith|Albert Smith]] lives in that neighbourhood â they were all
verry anxious to hear from you and wish to be remembered to you â brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] thinks of star
ting the 26 of this month for the South on a mission and brother [[Dwight Webster|Webster]] thinks of going with him.
Mr. [[Samuel Bogart|Bogart]] the Capt. of the [[Missouri|Missouri]] mob their election day shot [[Alexander Beattie|a man]] and he died the next
dayâ he has abscondedâ there is a reward of 500 dolls. offered for his apprehensionâ [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Brother]]
& [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|sister Smoot]] wishes to be remembered to you and send you their best wishes, he is ex
pecting to start for the south in a few daysâ he has been at home this winter. â Father Clar

brother [[William Oglesby Clark|Wm. C.]] his son sends his respects to you & says he is with you in heart in the minis
try, [[John Wesley Clark|Wesly Clark]] his brother is out on a mission.â Write often. Our cow and calf is her
on the place where I live. The editors of the papers made some new arrangements in regard
to the papers and began anew in Nov.â do you get your paperâ I sent for them to send father
Woodruff & [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter]] one as you mentioned to them before you left. I have not been acrost the
the river since you left nor hardly any where else; nor care much about going untill you
come home. Please give my respects to brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] and [[Willard Richards|Richards]] likewise all the saints about you.
14th today [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] is 20 months old and weighs 25 lbs.â 15th Brother Smoot has preached at
father Clarks & brought news that a company of the saints have lately landed in [[New York|N.Y.]]

A general conference is to be held the 6th of April in [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]]. 17th have just heard that [[Orson Hyde|O. Hyde]] &

March 8 & 22â 1840â
Answered June 3.d 1840oppen their way, brother [[Brigham Young|Young]] has been verry sick on his wayâ brother [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimbal]]
was in the state of [[New York|N.Y.]] some where but do not know whereâ brother [[John Edward Page|J. Page]]
is near [[Lima, Adams County, Illinois|Lima]] preachingâ has baptized 8 or 10 [[Orson Pratt|O. Pratt]] was expecting to start for
[[England|England]] as soon as he has company the last that I heard of himâ Brother
[[Lyman Wight|L. White]] called here a few days since says that he thinks of going to [[North Carolina|N.]] & [[South Carolina|S. Carolina]]
this summer to preach and does not know but that he shall come over and see you
he says that he never saw the gospel laid open so plain before him as within 2 or 3
weekâ he has moved about 20 miles above [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] on [[Skunk River, Iowa|skunk river]]. Commerce
is growing verry fastâ the lots of land are about all taken up there now.
Sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] and family are well she has signed for a lot of land since
brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] went away that he was talking about when here, and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Br. Joseph]]
is going to have a house built for her, I am glad for she has had a hard time this
winterâ likewise one built for sister [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]], and [[Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt|Pratt]], and says that any of
the wives of the 12 that wish to live in Commerce may have one built there 
what shall I do about it I rather expect to stay where I am untill you
return, but it is 6 miles back from [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]]â suppose that is to far from the
body of the church for youâ tell me in your next letter about what you
think will be best to do about itâ The work of God rolls on in the east
with much rapidity Br. Joseph said that [[Benjamin Winchester|B. Winchester]] had about as [much] [page torn]
as he could do daily to baptize in [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] likewise in the south [page torn]
[[George Washington Brandon|Washington Brandon]] that ^you^ formerly knew in [[Tennessee|Tennesse]] is preaching and [page torn]
living there and the work spreads faster than ever in that placeâ one brother
[[Isaiah Benton|Benton]] has denied the faith there. It is thought that the church is in the most
prosperous state now that it ever was since its rise.
You speak of our sacrifices I am verry sensible of them but consider my
last one greater than any or all of the rest the i.e. parting with my dear compa
nion so long and to go so far from me â believe me there is nothing but the spi
rit of God could reconcile me to it, and knowing that he is called by ^him^ God
to fill a mission and cry repentance to this generation I will try by the help
of God to be reconciled to the ^his^ will of God looking forward to the time of your
return home to the bosom of your family and the time that I trust we shall
be permited to stand on mount Zion with our little family nomore to be sep
arated, Yes my dear Willford I think our separation and trials will then be over,
let us then try to be faithful in keeping the commands of God. I believe that I hav
an interest in your prayers, never do I go before the throne of grace to as^k^ for blessings
for unworthy me but wahat what I remember my companion who has gone far
from me yes I remember you by day and by night even in the silent watches of the night
I now lay aside my letter for a few days untill a certain time shall arrive that I am looking for
dailyâ dread it muchâ wish you could be with me. March 22 that day has arrived & I wasâ 
presented with a little [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Wilford]] waying Eight poâ & aquarter whome I trust I shall be able
to keep with me (at least for a while) I am as comfortible as I can exspect
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|P. W. Woodruff]]I often wish that you could have her a little while perhapse one night or so and
then I could have her back againâ she is a verry affectionate child. I am now at
[[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Father Clark]]s where I have been about 12 weeks he has no wife she died just
before they were driven from [[Missouri|Missourie]]â he has made me welcome to stay here
untill you return; would it not be for the best think you,â they are a verry kind
family he says he wants me to feal as much at home as at my fathers house
sister [[Lurena Church Clark|Church]] that he hires to keep his house sends her respects to you and says
that she will take as good care of me as she can, she is a fine girl I think much
of herâ Old father [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] lives in our house in brother [[Pierce Hawley|Hawley]]âs [[Hawley's Grove, Lee County, Iowa|settlement]]
he (brother Hawley) moved his family to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Qunicy]] last fall but is expected back this
spring; he was appointed the bishops assistant, likewise brother [[Daniel Avery|Avery]] and brother
[[Thomas Harvey Owen|Owen]] in the same neighbourhoodâ but I should be verry sorry to be dependent on
them for my support for they talked of makeing me sell my clothes and things
to support myselfe ^when there^, but thank the Lord I am at present out of their hands; I 
hear of no such thing now. I have been liveing by the wayside as it were ever since
you let me, I hope that you never will take another manâs say so in regard
to such things again but I do not blame you in the least for these things but
impute it to menâs not keeping their word; My dear Willford can you not tell me
something near when you will be at home, for the time seames verry long
to me. I have not heared from [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father Woodruff]]âs family since you left
[[New York|N.Y.]] [illegible] ^shall^ you write to them or must I give them the news from you. I rece
ived a paper from sister [[Shuah Coffin Carter Moulton|Shuah]] a few days since she said they ^were^ well but [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]]
failed quite fastâ she has been to N.Y. to visit brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] she waited 2 weeks
to see you there but was much disappointed in not seeing youâ Brother
Joseph returned from [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] a few days since the present prospect is
that our brethren will get a redress of their wrongsâ they have now 2 mill
ions of dolls. of damage now before the house and a committee is now appoi
nted to go round among the brethren and get their affidavits and bills of
damage (that is those who have not given in their bills) and it is said that
they will amount to 1 million moreâ the majority of the house is in our
favourâ [[Henry Clay|Henry Clay]] and other influential men are warm advocates
for the churchâ Judge [[Elias Higbee|Higby]] [[Sidney Rigdon|S. Rigdon]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. Pratt]] and [[Benjamin Winchester|B. Winchester]] are
in Washington nowâ When our brethren first went to Congress they
told them they could do nothing for them, but the prospect is quite different
at now ^present^.â I expect that brother [[Orson Hyde|O. Hyde]] is on his way to [[England|England]] as I heard
that he was expecting to start todayâ I should have written by him had I
known it in timeâ the first of Jan. brother [[Brigham Young|Young]] and Smith were on
their way to [[New York City, New York County, New York|N.Y. citty]] and expected to cross the water when the Lord should
I have received 6 dolls. from you five in one letter & one in another which was verry acceptable but
feared that you would need it more than I did as the people are so poor in England[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] [[Lee County, Iowa Territory|Lee County]] March 8th 1840
My Dear Willford
As this is a memorable day to me I think I
cannot spend it better, than in writing to my dear Willford not being unmindful
that last sabbath was your birth ^day^ and knowing where we were last march about
this time, leads me to exclame Ah! what geat changes may take place in one
year and even in much less timeâ then my Willford was with meâ 
but where is he nowâ far far from me acrost the mighty deep but I
desire to be contented and reconciled to the will of God in all things, praying
him to protect you from all evil and return you home once more to the
bosom of your family who are anxiously weighting your return. I wrote to
you the first of Jan. but then did not know that you had sailed for [[England|Eng.]]
but soon after received your last letter from [[New York|N.Y.]] dated Dec. 17th the letter
was sent back to me by [[Mr. Killbourn|Mr Killbourn]] after I sent it to the Office, I them drect
directed it to England according to your diretions and hope that you have
recived it before this time. I have received five letters from you since
you left homeâ the first dated [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Sept. 30th. second N.Y. Oct 23rd
third Nov. 24th fourth Dec. 13th the fifth and last Dec. 17th and have written
you two before this,â when one is deprived of anothers company what a greate
blessing and consolation it is that we can converse with each other by letter
writingâ I am anxiously looking daily for a letter from you but take this
opportunity of writing to you lest within a few days I shall not be as well able
to write as nowâ my health is not verry good at present but I desire to be tha
nkful that it is as good as it is. I can sit up most all day and sew the most
of the timeâ O my dear Willford I wish you could be with me for a little while
now it would be the greatest consolation to me that I could have.â two or
three nights since I dreamed that you came home to stay with me a week or
two, believe me, I was highly gratified but when I awoke and found it but
a dream I was sadly disappointed,â but as it cannot be so at present I desire to
commit myselfe into the hands of God, with all that I haveâ Our little Sarah
Emma is well bright, and harty, and I think as busiy a child as you ever saw
she frequently calls aloud for her pa-paâ she clings around me as though I
was all the friend she had here which causes me unpleasant fealings, when I think

SHIP LETTER
Phebe July 2d 1840
Answered Aug 21st 1840
by brother [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] - they are much company - for me wish you could see
them a while I kiss them every day for their pa. My dear Willford did
you know that 11 long months has passed away and you have not said one word
about comeing home in your letters - is seames almost an age, do tell me
something about it in your next letter - may the will of the Lord be done
but I hope that it will be to send you home this fall is not pray the Lord
that I may  have patience and grace to bear it for it is all that I can be most
more than I can bear, to think of spending another cold long winter with
out you - If you could send the children some red flannel for winter
it would be verry acceptable - and my every day clothes are getting quite poor
as I have been out of health ever since you left home but am quite smart now
have not had a chill for 3 weeks - will you not bring your [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|son]] a cap when
you come home, however I suppose that you do not have much meanes to do with
we are poor but how can we help, it if it could be your privilege to stay at home
and we both labour hard I should think litely of it for the sake of your society - but
to be poor and alone to[o] is rather hard. and no prospect of its being different
is rather discourageing is it not Willford. - [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Brother Joseph]] says that it is the
elders privilege to spend half of their time with their families will you not
remember that Willford. If you do not I shall be apt to remind you of it. -
I suppose that you will remember it much as you did staying at home 3
yeares after we were married - I think if you do not stay at home home a while
the next time you come we will put on the big pot and all go for I am quite
tired of liveing alone - perhapes you may think that I have got to scolding but
you knowe me and therefore must not mind small things. [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Brother Taylor]] has
sent for [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|sister Taylor]] to come to him in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] without delay but brother
Joseph thought it not wisdom for her to go therefore she has given it up. I
heard [page torn] br he said that he and [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]] should go to [[England|England]] next season [page torn]
gathe[r] [page torn] the saints and the work would be finised there also that t[page torn]
wou[ld] [page torn] [b]egin to behead the saints within 2 years in England, [page torn]
Joseph [page torn] [h]as been advanceing new things to the church and publick [page torn]
late says that this earth was the largest ^panat [planet]^ that ever was made and that there
has been parts taken from it several times and at the time the 10 tribes
were lost there was a part taken from it and that that they would all come
back and be joined to it again and that would be the realing to & fro like
a drunken man  &c &c There has been some strange things taking place here of late
2 weeks since there was 2 horses seen to cross the [[Mississippi River, United States|Missisipi river]] one red and
the other white, the red one landed about opposite Josepâs house the other went
father down, it was seen by 4 persons in a boat crossing the river they were
so near that they could see the water slop under their feet and distinguish the
colour of the cloths that the rider's had on - when the red horse moved his tail
there would be fire fly from it. and Joseph [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]] and Hiram ^have^ gone
to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] to hold a debate with the Governor and a presbeterian minister
have not heard the result. I suppose that you  have learned the defeat of the
brethren at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] from the papers as brother [[George Washington Robinson|Robinson]] to^ld^ me he sent
them to you. I hear that 10 of the 70 are about starting for England, I should
think you would need assistance according to your preaching places; brother
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] I hear is one of the number and I think if [[Joseph Bates Noble|Bates Nobles]] was to go somewhere
on a mission it would do him good. - It is not so sickly in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]]
or [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] yet as last season. Please give my respects to the brethren
and tell them that went with you that I have lately seen sister Taylor
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Young Kimbal]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Pratt]] Hyde [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clark]] [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] & [[Joseph Hadlock|Hadlock]]. they were well & their
families. Dear Willford I want to see you so much but I believe that I can say upon
serious reflection that I have not wished you back once untill you have filled your
mission although I have had many trials since you left but I find God to be my
friend, I feel your absence to be a greate privation and sacrifice for me to make but
I hope and trust that you will be the means of doing much good and fill you mis
sion in the love and fear of God as soon as possible and come home to me and our
little ones as soon as possible with the smiles of heaven resting on you. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]] 
could not sit up to have my bed made, I was brought verry low in consequence 
of my situation little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] was verry sick at the same time both of our 
lives  were nearly dispaired of but through the mercy of God I got some better 
so that as soon as my house was called done I went into it, it had no door 
window or loft in it, and it was a hard matter for me to get it done any way they 
seamed unwilling to do it, I had no shelter for the cow and was much trou
bled to get wood, my house was verry open I was alone the most of the time, 
but could not sit up only a part of the time. I often felt that I was alone, 
a stranger in a strange land sick and ill provided for with my little Sarah clin
ging around me as though she had no other friend to look to for protection & 
not knowing how it might turn with me would often cause me peculiar feelings, 
but I would often look back and ask myself the question did I leave my fathers 
house for the sake of honour, ease, or popularity, I think I did not but for the word of 
God then I would try to be reconciled to my situation but I found it to be verry 
hard work in the situation that I then was inâ once I had a kind Willford to cheer 
me in my lonely hours, but then I had none. I lived in my house about 2 
months and quite as long as I wished in the situation that it was then in. Father 
Clark learned the situation that I was in he invited me to go to his house 
and spend the winter with ^then^ Sarah and my cow and calfe, and when I felt able 
to sew some for his family I accepted the invitation and am here now, in the 
spring he asked me to stay untill fall I have concluded to do so as they are building 
houses for the wives of the 12 in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] I shall probably voo move there in 
the fall I have flattered myself that I should have my Willford to help me move 
then, as I have moved 4 times since you left. Father [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] lives in 
my house now in Lovely street it was fitted up for for his family. Tell brother George 
Smith that his father and family are well have lately received a letter from him 
and sent an answer to itâ I wrote a little in it to you as I was there on a visit. 
I have just returned f[ro]m a visit to Commerce and that neighbourhood the first 
one I have made [sin]ce you left homeâ I was gone 3 weeks Brother [[Albert Petty|Petty]] has 
returned from the South and settled in Commerce brother [[Stephen Grant Luce|Stephen Luce]] and 
brother [[Isaac Carter Odekirk|Outerkirk]] lives there likewise brother [[Albert Smith|Albert Smith]] and [[Ephraim Grant Luce|Ephraim Luce]] lives 
on the west side of the river. The brethren have a got a big field as they call it 
in brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]]s neighbourhood it contains about 300 acres of land he 
(Smoot) has lately gone out on a mission for six months, brother [[Dwight Webster|Webster]] 
from [[Connecticut|Connecticut]] has gone with him he has been here and spent a week with 
me and brought me a letter from [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother Woodruff]] they were weell and 
mentioned haveing received a letter from youâ I shall write to them as soon 
as I finish this- I found brother Webster to be a fine man. I suppose you knew 
that he and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] were engaged to each other - he told me all about it when he 
was here. [[Sarah Milliken|Sarah Milliken]] expects to be married soon to a man out of the church 
he has lately joined the universal church so you can see how much faith ^he has^ in mormon
ism. [[Arthur Milliken|Arthur Milliken]] and [[Lucy Smith Millikin|Lucy Smith]] have lately been married Ilus 
Carter is married and still lives in [[New York|N.Y.]], I have received a letter from [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father]] 
and [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|mother Carter]] and she said that she expected to loose [[Shuah Coffin Carter Moulton|Shuah]] soon they were 
well, they want you to come there when you return home - [[Marietta Carter Holmes|sister Mary]] fails. 
Sister [[Rhoda Farnham Carter Scammans|Rhoda Scammans]] has got a young [[Sarah Carter Scammans|daughter]] 13 days older than our little, 
[[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford Owen]], which I  suppose you have heard of long since for I wrote a 
letter to you before I was confined but reserved a space in it to give you the news 
and kept it by me untill after my confinement then immediately had it finis
hed and sent it to the office I there gave you an account of my situa
tion but lest you have not received it I will say that I may had a 
fine son on the 22nd of March whome I call Willford for his long absent 
father he was taken with the hooping cough when 5 weeks old but has got over it 
now and grows finely it is said that he resembles his mother much. 
Sarah Emma grows f^i^nely is backward about talking but says many words 
calls poor, pa,pa, & prety pa pa many times in a day, she calls the babe pretty 
boy and pretty Willo, she runs out of doors to play much of the time, and is as busy as 
you ever saw a little one, she and Willford wrote to their papa in the letter that I sent[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] [[Lee County, Iowa Territory|Lee County]] July 2nd 1840
My Dear Willford
It is with peculiar feelings that that
I sit down to write to you at this time. I have not heared from you 
for nearly 5 months untill now, and I have been left to wonder at it, some 
times thinking that you might be in prison, or where you could not write 
I have felt more than common lonely of late, for what reason I do not know 
but your letter came to hand the 24th of June bearing date of April 24 which 
was cordially received. I was pleased to hear of your health and prosperity in 
the ministry but sorry to hear that you had not received any of my letters, 
this is the 5 one that I have written you since you left [[New York|N.Y.]] one of and they 
were writen verry ful I told you how things were with me in 
them. I directed three of them to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], [[Lancashire, England|Lankenshire]], [[England|England]],

by brother [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] and [[John Edward Page|Page]] when they started on their mission to the 
Jews. I have received three from you since you arrived in England 
one dated Jan. 12th another 29th then this last one April 24. I do hope 
that you will get them ^mine^ for I wrote much that you would like to 
know about my situation, house, cow, sickness, moveing from Lovely street 
to [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father Clarks]], &c, &c, which if you have not heard might be inter
esting to you. as it is quite a task for me to write now haveing two 
little one around ^one^ and poor health (yet I have taken the utmost pains 
to write to you since you left home) I will give you a brief sketch 
of these things. You left  me in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]], I kept about the house 2 weeks after, 
then was taken with the chills and fever went out to sister [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Smoots]] stayed

My Dear Willford
I think that you will believe me when 
I say that it is with peculiar feelings that I commence this sheet to you 
my dear Willford what will be your feelings when I say that yesterday 
I was called to witness the departure of our little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] from this 
wold world- yes she is gone â the relentless hand of death has snatched her from 
my embrace â but Ah! she was to lovely to kind to affectionate to live in 
this wicked world â when looking on her I have often thought how
I should feell to part with her I thought I thought could not live 
without her especially in the absence of my companion - but she is gone
the Lord has taken her to himself for some wise purpose â It is a severe 
trial for me to pass through particularly so in you absence but the 
Lord has stood by me in a wonderfully manner I can see and feell that 
he has taken her home and will take better care of her than I possibly 
could for a little while untill I shall go and meett her â Yes Willford
we have one little angel in heaven and I think it likely her spirit 
has visited you before this time â I do not know how to live without her
she I used to call her poor pa-pa and pretty pa-pa many times in a day 
she left a kiss for her pa-pa just with me just before she died â she 
eat her dinner as well as usuall thursday about 4 oclock she was
taken with a prestness for breath we done every thing for her that we 
could called for the elders and had her anointed a number of times and 
hands laid on her but all to no avail the next day her spirit took its flight
from this to another world without a groan so that now I am dep-
rived of every thing near and dear to me but my little darling [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] 
for the things of the world are empty and vain to me and he is not verry 
well â Today Willford and I with quite a number of our friend ac-

Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Sister]]
As Willford has reserved for me a page to fill, I will now cheerfully (thoâ in something of a hurry)
seat myself to pen you a few lines. I recieved your Letter at the hands of my brother and was truly glad to
hear from you, was sorry however to hear of the ill state of your health as also that of your family, but
how it will soon be improved. Wilford as you are aware is quite unwell, and we feel as you write, much
anxiety respecting him, as he is about to undertake such a journey. and it seems to me as thoâ I could
not have him leave us so soon, but then, we know that God has called and said âGoâ, and
shall we worms of the dust say stay' Nay, but let us rather rejoice that he is accounted worthy
to become a messenger from God to the nations of the earth. but still my natural feelings at times
gain the ascendency and I can hardly reconcile myself to have him leave us. I need not say that
W. is a brother that I set much by of this you probably are aware. but as [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] is gone, my
affections return with double force upon Willford. I place confidence in him as I formerly did
in Asahel, looking to him, as a friend and protector, I hope however I shall not forget that
my comforts and blessings flow from God, the bountiful giver of all good,
I suppose I shall have to be brief at this time, but I shall write you from time to ti[me] [page torn]
shall hope to hear from you often, and do give us a particular account of things an[d] [page torn]
with you, for we shall ever be glad to hear, and also as it respects the situation of the church.
I would ask no greater blessing than to be permitted to take up my residence with the Saints with the
Saints at the west, I would be willing to undergo ma[n]y earthly privations. I have felt as thoâ I should
like it much could I be with you whilst W. is gone his mission, but I suppose it would not be
considered consistent at present. but I do feel as thoâ I should be permitted e'er long, to stand on
Mount Zion with the blessed company. pray for me Sister, that I may live in such a manner
as to be accounted worthy to escape the just judgments of God abroad in the land, and finally
have a standing given me with the saints of God. I have been quite unwell most of the time since
W. has been at home and consequently have not received as much pleasure in hearing him converse upon
this Latter day work, as I otherwise should have done. but we have had a very pleasant with him, and
shall remember it with much pleasure. the greatest complaint I make is that I have not had scarcely
any apportunity of conversing with him myself. I hope the Lord will grant that he may have grace
given him to perform his mission acceptably. that the Lord would be with him and bless him
continually. grant him with the rest of the company a safe and pleasant journey over the waters
and when their mission is fill'd return them safe to the bosom of their friends.
My best wishes for the welfare of yourself and babe, I remain yours, Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]]with peculiar feelings as I journied by land the places whare you suffered

boat for [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]], arrived at Albany on the 19th. during which time in consequence of the cold I took on the Lake
with the crowded situation of the boat, caused a return of the chills and fever, which I had every day for
the last week of my journey. I took stage at Albany at 10 oclock at night, travell'd through the night, and
also the next day, and finally arrived at [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] about sunset. spent the night at Aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Wheelers]], the next
morn being the 21st of Sept. I arrived at [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] house at [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], and had the happy privilege throâ
the blessing of God, of once more meeting Fathers household face to face, have now been at home about 10 days
and immediately on my return home as I began to be recruited from my journey, my health began to
amend, and did not have my turns of fever and ague, although I have felt the effects of it in some
degree from day to day, but I would here say that I have felt perfectly easy as regards the affliction of my
body feeling confident that I shall soon recover my usual health. and I would here say as before that I do
not wish you to give yourself an uneasiness as it regards my health, only give me your prayrs, and all will
be well. I would just also remark that I lacked nothing on my journey as it regards my temporal wants, and
had 50 cents left when I arrived at Fathers, and my purse is beginning to be replenished so that I shall
be enabled to continue my journey in a few days. since at home I have had an interview with most of the
Saints that belong to this small branch of the church. Uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]], Sister [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna Cossitt]] brother Dwightâ
Webster &c. were among the number, and I felt truly ^to^ rejoices before the Lord to find them firm in the faith
and holding fast whereunto they had attained, and determined to do the will of the Lord henceforth, and they
have a Zion spirit desiring to gather with the Saints. I would say that my Grand mother, [[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|Anna Thompson]],
departed this life a day or two since. was buried yesterday. We have visited Uncle [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart]] found him quite low
and to all appearance near the borders of the grave. as it regards the rest of our friends they are usually well,
I have not as yet heard from any of our friends in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], but I expect soon to see brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] in
[[New York|New York]].
Give my respects to Sisters [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] all the Saints in [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] and [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] from head to foot
inasmuch as you have an apportunity, tell brother [[Pierce Hawley|Hawley]] that I have had an interview with
his brothere in law [[Robert P. Sattley|Mr Satler]], he was very anxious to see him. I must now draw to a close
as Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] will fill the remainder of this sheet, b I hope I shall be gratified with a
Letter from you before I leave New York.
I still remain yours in the strongest ties,
Wilford Woodruff

N.B. I would here remark that I discovered your âpetitionâ soon after leaving home and was highly
edified with the spirit thereof thereof and I pray God my heavenly Father at all times to answer
all such prayrs that may ascend in our behalf.
