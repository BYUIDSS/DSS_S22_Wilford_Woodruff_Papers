would not suffer materially if they did not get
a Territorial Government immediately or something to
that Effect. I am of his opinion I think so to [&amp;]
think it would be a good plan to take his adv[i]se
&amp; withdraw the petition! If we want a Territorial
Gove[rnmen]t we can call for it another session
If we want a State Govern[men]t we will be in
also be in a situation to apply for it if we are
not confined under a Territorial.

Thus you have my views &amp; I pray God to sustain
&amp; uphold you &amp; lead you right.

Mr [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Babbitt]] informed me in his last that if
th[e]y gave us a Territorial Govern[men]t at all
they would send Pharaohs to rule over us. I have
expressed my feelings to you in other Letters freely
upon those points I am the same now

I wish to know if this reaches you in safety drop me

Brother Bernhisel

Dear Sir

I receved your interesting Letter
of the 22nd intat and nothing but a croud of businss has
prevented me from you upon the subjet of which
you speak even befoe I receved yours. I was privileged
with the company of professor [[Orson Pratt|O. pratt]] [[Erastus Snow|Erastus Snow]] &amp; J B.
Wallace on the Sabbath &amp; I convrsed freely with those
Brethn upon the Subject &amp; I find but one spirit &amp; opinion
prevailing amog us &amp; that is, it is far better to withdraw
the petition for the present untill you can consult
your constituents than to receive a Territorial Gove[rnmen]t
with Military polititions sent unto our midst to tyronize
[ovr] us who has no interest in our welfare it is my
firm conviction that the Citizens of [[Utah Territory|Deserett]] will sustain
you in withdrawing your petition for the time being
rather ^than^ to receive a Terratorial Gov[ernmen]t with the spirit
of restrictions that the present Congress manifest
in disposition to lay upon us. Yes Brothe Bernhisel
watch well the signs of the times in this matter do
not let a n[e]t be flung [ovr] the people of Deserett
to their inquiry they should have the rights of Citizenship
as well as other people. The president has recomede[n]d
in his speach a thought that the people of the [[Utah Territory|Basin]]from Him of any kind, and that mostly cncing [concerning] a [poer] of Attorny
to collet some mo[ne]y for some powers in [[Iowa|Iowey]]. Yet notw?hst?d?
all this I have not for a momet suffered the spirit of prejudice
or Jealousy to take root in my heart agaist him as though 
He was neglecting me or was not interestaed in my welfare 
or prosperity, or equally ingaged in the same Common 
cause with myself, and I have not felt in the least [to]
[imparte] it to any other cause ownly that He was overwhelmed
in busness &amp; cares.  I am aware there from conversation
with yourself &amp; public papers, that [there] had been a ^former^ differenc 
betwng you &amp; Mr. [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] But since that He has pub[lis]hed
throgh the [[Frontier Guardian|Guadian]] that it was all made up &amp; [settletled] &amp; 
I had no idea but that you were on the best of terms
But to sum up the whole matter ^of this subjet^ my views are those
That the cause ^in which^ you are ingaged in is of Equal interest to 
yourself, Dr [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]], Mr Hyde, myself,  and evy good man
who expets to become a Citizen of the State of Deseret, and I 
consider that any man who has any different veiws of this subjet 
has a wrong one. Men may differn in politics, I nevr cast
any other vote at the poles in my life, even my [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Father]] before me 
that I werehve any knowledge of, except a Democrat vote, still &amp; 
consider our petition to Congress for a Goverment for Deseret
a vary differet thing from party politics, I consider it are
common cause for all the inhabitants of that Stat whether
[thy] [they] be wDemocrats Whigs or Free soil and I consider any
lawful or legarl influenc extented to eventually give Deseret a 
State Gvement to be of interest &amp; worth to her inhabitats let it 
eminate from what party it may. This I have given you 
my views concering thesee points in your letter that needed explanatin
as feel as I am enabled to do in a communcatin of this ki[n]d a[n]d
I hope it will be satisfactory as far as I am conceed [concerned]. have writtenthe Dr ^[[John Milton Bernhisel|Berhisel]]^ Since my return Home.  I Haven got
recieved a letter from him to day by the same mail that
Brought yours. As to ^the^ accusations against me in the phrasologey 
of wanton Neglect in not writing you is an accusation that I shall 
not recieve for I am not guilty, in in that sense of the word
and I think friends ought to study each othrs Circumstnces
sufficiently at least to lay a fondatiun for reasonable excuses
whae their is any seeming neglect towards us before we ac?ee
them to strongly. I wrote you a letter to lay the fondation for 
a Correspondane you answered it and the following is your closing
remak "I will keep you informed of all matters &amp; things transpiring here
as touching our common Interest," that letter it is true I did
not answer." In this it may hve appeared to you a [seemg]
neglect, still I do not think from that circustanc you 
are warranted in taking the strong grounds in which you accuse 
me, for in reality I did not intend any neglect whatev?e
for as I hve already explaned I thoght one Com[mun]icati[o]n 
every Western officers ^upon the subjet which I wrote^ would answer for both this in 
Connexion with my being overwhelmed is business was the
ownly reasn why I did not write to both, and agn 
frm your last sentanc I judged that I should hve reced [received]
anoth letter from you before long. So much I hve [said]
for myself, As conceing Mr [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] I have ownly to say 
that I have no knowledge concing am [any] instructions He may 
have recieved from the presidency concing your mission 
or any othe Subject any further than what is made public 
through the prress. For although I hve been travelling in this 
Easten Contry a[mon]g the Chches, for near two years &amp; sent
him many ^a dozen or more^ letters, containg some 60 or 70 subscribers for the [[Frontier Guardian|Guadan]]
yet I have [never] as I recollet recved but two commd?tesinstead of finding rest I fo[u]nd a vary large nuber of 
lying before me some 25 ^[many]^ letters from vari[ou]s parts of the world
among them was one from Dr [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] &amp; one from yourself. I 
also had rec[eiv]ed among othr thgs an Epistle from the valley
&amp; Letters from the presidency ^in [[Salt Lake Valley, Utah Territory|the valley]]^ requiring certain things [of] ^me^ my hads 
which required me to correspod with the Ch[ur]ches which 
I have to do by lettr writing as I have No other way of Communi 
cation with them, and Hence I need to write some 50 Letters &amp; mail
last Week and am[on]g [thous] I sent one ^one of that [nuber] I sent^ to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] which I 
happened to write and address to Dr. Bernhisel instead of yourself 
as I had Nothing to communicate except what was from the 
valley &amp; that I expeted you would both receve before mine
woud arive in the form of a visit from Messers [[Joseph Leland Heywood|Haywood]] &amp; [[Edwin Dilworth Woolley|Wooley]]
or by the Epistle, still lest you should not receve it I [send]
it in [my] letter to Dr. Bernhisel, and if ^my^ I had had time 
^had permtted^ I should have ansued both letters, or if I had known that 
or even th[ou]ght that it would have made any difference in 
your feelings, or that you ^[consdered] you^ was slighted I certainly should 
have add[r]essed you instead of him, But such a thought 
neer entered my mind. In addressing him or if I had addessed
you upon that subject it would have been the came with me for I 
should have Had no othr thought but that one comunicatin to 
either of you Concning any News from the valley would have been 
Communictated to equally to both, for I had the not the most
distant idea but what you were haveing a free exchange of views &amp; 
sentim[en]ts, in a sotcial manner, almost daily, for the Dr Berhisel had
neer hinted any idea contrary to it in any communcation to me. I 
wrote to the Dr as We had spent Considerable time in social con-
versation upon a variety of subjects, ^just previous to his going to Washington^ &amp; I should liked to have enjoyed
the came privilege with your self, that is the ownly lettr I[sideways text]

Dear Sir

Yours of Jan 16th has just come to hand and I
must Confess that I am much surprised at its contents and 
do not understand it. and I feel think it needs some wisdom
to answer such letters in a right &amp; proper manner lest misun-
derstanding arise of an unpleasant nature between men who are 
endeavoring to bring to pass the same object. It it's is also often more 
difficult to explain many matters and things by Letter writing than it
is in personal Conversation, However I will venture to come to the subjet 
you say you have not recieved a letter from "any one haveing influenc
in the Ch[ur]ch" "Or from any leading men in the Chuch" Now I may
not be a proper judge what amount of influence I may have in the Ch[ur]ch
Still I believe I have some and have endeoved [endeavored] to use that influenc for 
the general good of the whole to the best of my ability" I write you
a letter by Dr [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] who was going Direct to [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] to cooperate
(as I supposed) with you) for the vary purpose of laying a foudations to Correspond
with you. The following was the closing remarks "I should essteem it 
a great favor to meet in council with you &amp; Dr. Bernhisel at Washington 
but do not now expet to have the oppertunity" I should take it as a 
faver if you would write to me occasinally and infore me of your 
progress &amp; prospets" This letter you recieved. On my I also 
addressed a short note to you while at [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York]] as a Letter of
introduction of Mr [[George Copway|Copway]] who was expeting to go [Soon] to Washington

Dear Sir

I have just ar[ri]ved in this
City &amp; obtained your Letters, you will of course 
follow the instructions you have recved from Head
quarters if you fail in a State &amp; go in for a Territory 
as the last resort I think that every exhertion in any 
power should be made to get our own officers elected
say [[Brigham Young|Brigham Youg]] [illegible] Governor &amp; go down according to theirs 
appointment as far as possible a I recved a Note from Col [[Thomas Leiper Kane|Kane]]
this evening who are from Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]] who informed me 
that the Letters from Mr [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Carter]] to the [[Maine|Maine]] members was
sent to me at [[Cambridgeport, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Cambridgeport]] and was immediately forwaded 
on to you at [[Washington, D.C., United States|washington]] which I trust you have got 
Mr Carter informs me that the Maine Members have 
promissed to do all they can for us connstantly &amp;c which I 
think will be a help to you. My family are all well 
I am also. I had a meeting n[i]ght before last in [[Hornerstown, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Horne[rs]town]]

Dear Sir

I have just ar[ri]ved in this city 
and recived your Note together with Dr [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisels]]
Letter who are direct from him to me. I wrote to him 
the evening I ^last^ saw you also sent him another the next 
day requsting him to take the word Territory out of the 
petition before it was presented at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]
also remarked that I would rather the bill would 
be withdrawn than to recieve a Territory unless we 
had the fullest assureance given us by the presidet
that officers of our own choice wshould be appointed 
Dr Bernhisel informs me that they are instructed
to ask for a Territory if they cannot get a State 
then as a last resort if the State fails we must use 
every possible exhertion to get our own officers appoited 
and trust the event in the hands of God. I shall write Dr 
Bernhisel immediately. I will say I have been enabled to 
procure letters of recommendation for Dr Bernhisel to 
the Senators and Representatives from the State of [[Maine|Maine]] 
who have promised to [go] for our cause

That peace Health, Strength and prosperity may attend 
you is the cincere prayer of yours Truly

Wilford WoodruffnanAnd now Dear [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Sir]] permit me by way of conclusion to say that
since you have been at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washigton]] If I have not written much
to you, I have gone before the Lord &amp; bowed my knees in earnest
prayer day by day and prayed for your success &amp; prosperity in the glorious
cause ^in which^ your are engaged in, also for Dr. [[John Milton Bernhisel|Bernhisel]] believing that you both
[was] doing your best to exhert an influence if not with the same
individuals that it was all lending to the same cause &amp; to produce
the same effects and I will furthermore say that I will ^not ownly^ continue to
pray for your success, But I feel to sustan you with evry feeling
&amp; sentimnt of my heart evy way in my power in accomplishing the
object of your mission ^at^to Washington, and I will endeavor to do
the same for evey agent who goes forth for the benefit of [[Utah Territory|Deseret]]
under the seal &amp; sanction of her Cetizens.  I will also say that I will
endeovor to be more punctual in answering any communitions
from you than I was in answring your last for I certanly
wish to correspond with you while I am in this Couty I

Dear Sir

I sent you a few lines last night ^eveneg^
written in great Haste, as the boat was about to start but one item
which I intended to have mentioned was omitted which I con
sider quite essential and which I did not think to mention when I
saw you.  If I mistake not the petition to which the signers names
are attached calls for a Territorial Governmnet if that is the case it
appeares to me that that petition should not be presnted befoe
Congress by any means untill it is altered I think that wise
policy would dictate that the word Territory be not so much as
once named in any petition or address which you have to
lay before congress in the request which is now made at there
hands, but State and State alone the ownly thing we ask for
and with my present feelings I pray to God with all my heart
that sooner than to have a Territorial Govenment given us that
they may not be permitted to give us any ^a^ Govement at all unless
by all means we could have our own Govenor &amp; other offcers
which is a vary uncertain matter, if we could not get a State
would it not be better to withdraw the bill or petitions as
we afterwards could again present a petition for a state while
if we were a Territory we could not do it perhaps for many
years besides all the trouble that would arise from Haveing
officers &amp; polititions among us who would have no interest in our
wilfare I throw these things [out] as they rest upon my mind
for your consideratin this subject is increasing upon my mind
and rests with wait upon me more &amp; more day &amp; night &amp; is uppermost
above all other considerations and I do not know but I feel as much
interested in it as though the whole concern rested upon my shouldiers

I called Satudy &amp; Mondy

this afternoon for [[New York|New York]].  The subject I wished to
save a few words upon was this I have discovered of late
occasinally a threat made by the Editors of the various

conveying an idea that they are vary Hostile to the Gov[e]r[nme]nt
&amp; that th[e]y take up &amp; try men for being engaged in
the Missoure war or but I wish it to be distictly
understood that all these things are composed &amp; put forth
at this critical time for political effect in order to
preijudice the public mind &amp; govnmet against us, d[u]ring this
session of congress supposing that the Citizens of Deseret are
at to great a distance to contradict Such any statemnt that
made may be made. and this is the ownly true light
in which such reports should be [considered] let them
eminate from whatever source they may for the Citizens
of Deseret have manifested their attachmet to the govmet &amp;

Dear Sir

In my reflections I have thought
there might be some dubiety resting upon your mind
in regard to the views of the inhabitants of the State
of Deseret upon the subject of Slavery in consequece 
of their not introducing a clause in there State Constitu-
tion prohibiting Slavery. I think your interesting
visits in our midsts, your travels in our encampments,
your clame of observations in our families Assem-
blies &amp; Councils whare the sentiments of our hearts have
been freely poured out before you must all combine
to convince you that the inhabitants of the State of
Deseret will never sustain in any [wise] the institution
of Slavery in their midst. We are a peaceful and
industrious people have removed to the sequestered vally
of the Great Salt Lake. we do not wish to have anythg
to do with the "vexed question of Slavery" or any of the
other exciting political questions and therefore we deemed
it expedient not to introduce a clause into our
Constitution prohibiting the introduction of Slaves into
the State of Deseret but Slavery can never be
Tolerated there

The deep interest I feel at 
heart for the general good interest &amp; welfare of the inhabitants 
of the State of Deserett at this critical &amp; important crises
is the apology I offer, &amp; the ownly motive that induces me at 
this time to address you by Letter. as I may not have a 
per[s]onal interview with you which I should be vary glad
to have befoe your arival at Congress [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] 
or our petition is presented before Congress, I wish to 
suggess present a few items for your consideration. In the 
first place I will ^wish to^ say I have not been Idle since I learned
that the inhabitants of the vally had organized a State Governtment 
&amp; that you was their delegate to Washington but I 
have endeavored to do all in my power to assist the cause
in any way that I could, and I am fully convinced
from what I have learned from various sources &amp; classes
that a most judicious, wise, discreet &amp; prudent cource must 
be carried out in this affair in order to secure success
I also firmly believe that you ought not to commit
yourself in the least by taking sides with the democrats
whigs, Free Soil, or any ^othr^ party for by so doing at the comm[encem]ent
of the service I belive it would be certain death, to your 
success but take a Neutral groud at first &amp; watch the signs

Dear Brother

I Receieved your letter under
Date of Dec 31st &amp; I set down this evening to answer
it. I do not feel disposed to take up a great
deal of this Sheet in speaking of things
in this country for I have not much

say however that we expect to Baptize a
number in few days &amp; Doctor [[William Copeland|copeland]]
among the Number, But it is the hardest
case I ever saw to pick up Saints in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]
We had a hard tempest in the city last

done in a late Storm in the [[Black Sea|Black Sea]] 18 Greek

Land &amp; Saints Sister Kimball said they took much
pains to acquaint themselves with things in that, place
&amp; when they came away they offered to bring letters or papers to

the letter from [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|my wife]]. It was truly a trial to her to loose
her little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|girl]] so sudden &amp; that to in my absence but she
bears it vary well, &amp; feels quite resigned it gave me a sudde[n]
shock when I first saw it in Elder [[Willard Richards|Richards]] letter but it was but
for a moment. I felt much resigned to it. I have written my
wife a long letter which I sent her yesterday. I was glad to
hear that you &amp; [[Heber John Richards|Heber John]] was comfortable I hope the
Lord will spare your life &amp; the lad to see good days. Sister

new Settlement. He sayes Gov[r] [[Thomas Carlin|Carlin]] has made a demand
of Gov [[Lilburn Williams Boggs|Boggs]] of our Brother that was kidnaped &amp; says he will cary
it to the fullest extent of the Law. Brother Petty thinks it will
make some disturbance between [[Illinois|Illinois]] &amp; [[Missouri|Missouri]] But
I say go ahead. I dreamed my child was dead on the

Beloved Brother

Your kind Letter &amp; 1 post order
came to hand in good Season &amp; in a time of need without
which we could not have paid our Bills last night
As we have had to pay for our board, lodgings, room, fire,
candles, Washing, preaching room, printing Bills, letter postage,
&amp;c. &amp;c. it has taken away our money &amp; as the Saints have
not been able to help us at all here it has fallen upon our
sholdiers alone, there is beginning to be some inquiry into
our doctrin in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] at least the people are begining to call
for the Stars &amp; Books &amp;c. &amp; there is a peace in the yesterday
London Times against us taken from the Leeds Paper so I hope that
will set the people to inquiring about us, there are some persons
in the Streets that pull down our hand Bills so that people
will not see them, for some cause or other the devil is
dreadful fraid the work will get set up in London. I wish
we had a few copies of the voice of Warning which I think would
do good to be put into the hands of s[o]me inquiring minds
I know not what will be done here in London, it seems
to be rather slow making a Start, it is sumthing as it was 
in [[Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland|Edinburgh]] We cannot get many of the people out to hear
But yet we do not feel all at all discouraged about the
matter the work is in the hands of God, &amp; we leave it with him
We mean to do the Best we can. I dont know what the
day will bring forth we have a meeting this afternoon &amp;
Evening. It seems Brother [[Orson Pratt|Orson pratt]] is begining to do well
in Edinburgh &amp; I am glad to hear it he thinks of Spending
the winter there unless the Lord Orders otherwisewhich will prove a savior of life unto life or of Death unto Death not ownly unto 
them, but unto all they unto whom the sound thereof shall come, even of the whole 
gentile world &amp; the judgment of the great day shall manifest the truth of it unto all 
nations. And it will ever sweeten the memory of that eventful period of my life 
to know that our labours on that occasion were not in vain. But that we were 
enabled through the great mercy &amp; goodness of God &amp; toil, labour, dilligent search, &amp; 
perseverance, to find some of the Blood of Ephraim, a few honest souls that were 
willing to recieve &amp; obey the gospel &amp; that we were enabled to lay the foundation 
of a work in that [[London, Middlesex, England|City]] which will not be removed untill the City is warned so that 
they will be left without excuse, &amp; the saints gathered out to stand in Holy places 
while judgment works. Untill that time the seed which we have sown in that 
city &amp; that which you are now sowing shall bring forth fruit &amp; the fruit 
shall remain to the honour &amp; glory of God &amp; I say it in the name of 
Jesus Christ &amp; the Spirit Beareth record &amp; the record is true. Therefore 
Brethren let your souls rejoice, &amp; your hearts be made glad, that we are permitted 
to bear some humble part in the sacrafices, sufferings, &amp; reproach of Christ &amp; of 
warning this generation &amp; of gathering together the honest in heart &amp; the meek
of the Earth that they with us may stand together in Holy places while judgement 
works ^works^, &amp; be prepared to enter into that rest which remaineth for the People of 
God. And Dear Brethren my prayer to God is that we may ever be meek &amp; humble 
that the Power of the Priesthood &amp; the spirit of our ministry &amp; mission may rest upon 
us that we may be carried through evry strait Place wherein we are called to walk that
we may keep the faith &amp; overcome the world. I pray my heavenly Father in the name of 
Jesus Christ that this may be our happy lot &amp; that we, with all the Elders of Israel, &amp; Saints
of God may be prepared to joyfully meet our Lord &amp; Master when he appeareth again the second 
time without sin unto salvation.

Thus Testifieth your Brother in the Everlasting Covenant

Copy of a letter from 
W Woodruff to HC Kim
ball &amp; [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]] 
Sept 12th 1840occupied by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, &amp; his Highness Prince Albert, except while they
are at [[Windsor Castle, Windsor, Berkshire, England|Winser Castle]]. [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]] Covers a number of acres of ground &amp; is surro
unded by a high wall of hewn stone except the front which is a high fence of cast Iron
railing, &amp; evry door, enterence, &amp; gate was strongly guarded by armed soldiers. I walked 
nearly around this castle Palace, &amp; while there I for the first time had a view of his 
Royal Highness Prince Albert while he was riding from his palace across [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St James Park]]
mounted upon a gray horse accompanied ownly by his groom who was riding a sorrel horse.
I also spent a few moments in the [[National Gallery, Westminster, Middlesex, England|National gallery]] which was ^is^ not unprofitable to a traveller
desiring to form a knowledge of countries &amp; the art of man. This gallery contains a vary 
great &amp; extensive variety of the most Perfect Paintings that could be gathered together 
by the Nation, these with other things we have had the privilege of forming a 
knowledge of for ourselves. ^But^ Brethren while you discover that I hav written rather 
largely concerning these temporal &amp; perishable objects which are in the same state, &amp; doomed to 
share the same fate in the revolutions of the last days &amp; the fall of Babylon, as Jerrusalem
did when they rejected their king &amp; put to death the Messiah, think not that I for a moment
harbour the idea that the ownly benefit we have derived in the enjoyment of our late 
mission together in the City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] has been a knowledge of these things, far from this.
for while I have spoken of these things while they were in memory more for the purpose
of preserving a historical sketch of the same than other wise, still the remaining part of 
the subject rest upon my mind with greater weaight. Yes Brethren our late mission together 
has not ownly put us in possession of a knowledge of those things spoken of but it hath 
given us a more intimate acquaintance with each other &amp; that to in some degree in the midst
of trials, which acquaintance has had a tendancy if possible to unite our hearts
more closer together in the love of God &amp; the New &amp; Everlasting Covenant. this is 
not all. we have stood together in this first mission to the city of London in which 
we have had the privilege of uniting our labours in lifting up the standard of truth, of 
light, &amp; the fulness of the everlasting gospel, &amp; When on dilligent search we found the whole 
city given to Idolitry, Priescraft, tradition, superstition, &amp; all manner of abominations wick-
edness, &amp; uncleanness &amp; all doors closed against us we did not hesitate to stand in 
the midst of the streets &amp; Jonah like cry repentance unto the Inhabitants of that mighty 
city, The Metropolis of [[England|England]], the Pride &amp; glory of [[Great Britain|Britain]], the Boast of the Gentiles &amp; the
largest city in the world, containing one million five hundred thousand souls who were 
ripened in iniquity, &amp;prepared for the wrath of God, &amp; like the ox going to the slaughter 
know not the day of their visitation. Yes Brethren I shall long remember standing in 
the midst of that people &amp; assisting you in bearing a message unto them, a message? Viz 1. St. Benedict. 2. St. Edmund. 3. St. Nicholas. 4. Henry the Seventh. 5. St. Paul.

15 Doctors, 52 Sirs. 153 Gentleman, &amp; 48 Ladys, making 421 persons who have been 
deposited in vaults in this [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Abbey]] &amp; Monuments erected to their memory. Here we had the privilege
of viewing the full stature &amp; perfect likeness of Queen Elizabeth, Mary, &amp; Anne 
Lord Nelson, &amp; Pitt &amp; others. We saw the full Coronation Dress of Queen Anne. We 
also saw the chair &amp; sat in it, in which Queen Victoria was crowned &amp; all the Kings 
&amp; Queens in [[England|England]] for the last 800 years this chair is covered with gold tissue. It 
contains a stone under the seat upon which all the Scottish Chiefs, &amp; Kings were crowned 
since they were a people it is reported to be Jacobs Pillar which chair has been in use 800
years. In walking through this Abbey we see frequent marks of violence from Oliver Cromwell
in defacing some of the tombs, monuments, &amp; brass work with which some of the Abbey was 
adorned. Here we behold the art of man with all its combined force &amp; power spun to the 
finest thread, &amp; expanded to the fullest extent in the building &amp; finishing of this Abbey as 
a general whole, But more esspecially that part called Henry Sephenth Seventh's Chapel
&amp; a visit to this Abbey is not ownly worthy of the Attention of all travellers but to occupy 
a place in the Journal of any Historian.

While speaking upon this subject I would 
not pass over our visit to the [[Palace of Westminster, Westminster, Middlesex, England|house of Parliment]], on the 8th of Sept. As we entered the 
house of Lords (now occupied as the house of Commons) ^we did not behold^ so much to interest the sight of the eye as 
the meditation of the mind, however we had the privilege of resting ourselves by siting in the chair in 
which the speaker of the house of Lords had sat for many years. In this room all the speeches were 
made by Mr William Pitt while advocating the American cause, before the Revolution. In this room
all the laws were made that now governs ^from^ 175 to 200 000 000 of human beings. As the house of 
commons was burned down about six years since this room at the present time is occupied by ^for^ the 
house of commons &amp; there is another house now built which the house of Lords at the 
present time occupies. One would naturly suppose that a house of Parliament fitted up to 
contained Kings, Lords, &amp; Commons would be sumthing extra, grand, &amp; expensive but we found 
it quite the reverse. It is excedingly plain &amp; undecorated. On entering the room one would 
sooner think he was in an American school house rather than in a house of Lords or of Commons.
While retiring from this scenery we had a view of the order of British soldiery or foot guards
while on parade in [[St James Park, Westminster, Middlesex, England|St James' Park]], accompanied by a full band of music. Also of the Queens 
Horse guard 100 in number well mounted upon fat gay black mares, &amp; the steel with which 
their bodies were covered glistening in the Sun. We might make mention of the monument
erected in honour to his grace the Duke of York which was 135 feet in highth &amp; of the 
mansion of Queen Dowager widow of the Late King Williams IV which we had a 
view of as we past along. In fine St James Park is surrounded as it were with Dwellings
mansions, castles, monuments, &amp; Palaces, of the first class as to size, splendour, &amp; Note of any in 
Europe, of which [[Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Buckingham Palace]] is the Chief. this is for the Royal Family &amp; is now [[Leigh, Gloucestershire, England|Leigh]], Gloucestershire, England. Sept 12th, 1840.

Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimball]] &amp; [[George Albert Smith|G. A. Smith]].

Beloved Brethern,

I am in the midst 
of the saints at the Leigh enjoying good health &amp; spirits. &amp; while 
meditating upon the scenes which have transpired with me during the 
last 23 days which has been spent with you on a mission in the 
City of [[London, Middlesex, England|London]], I feel disposed to pen a few of my thoughts on paper for your 
perusal. Brethren this is the first mission we have ever enjoyed together in the vineyard. Can 
we for a moment say that our time hath been spent in vain during this period? Nay we cannot 
the spirit within me forbids it. Have we not profited by this school of experianc? yea much 
evry way. While the Lord hath manifested by revelation that it is his will that we should obtain a 
knowledge of Kindgdoms &amp; countries, this mission hath placed us in a situation to avail our- 
selves of the desired information upon many things that which we could not otherwise
have obtained. Time will clearly show that the late mission which we have enjoyed together
in the City of London (which is still continued by your labours) will ever be firmly engraved 
in our minds &amp; occupy an important place, In the history of our travels among the 
Nations of the Earth. When London feels the chastning hand of the ALMIGHTY 
&amp; in her turn amid the revolutions of the gentile world finds her doom is sealed with her
lofty spires, synagogues, mansion, &amp; pallaces, laid in one common ruin, then with what feelings
shall we address our children or the thousands that may surround us, while our heads
are blossoming with age, as we point to the 21st day of September ^october Aug^ 1840, when we 
stood together upon the top of the most splended &amp; highest modern pillar in the Univers &amp;
with the naked eye surveyed the most populous &amp; wealthy city upon the face of the 
earth, which we can then exclaim hath been the theater of much misry &amp; wo, but now sleeps
in death. We ^having in my possessin a history of places visited I feel disposed to give the same {that [and may he] give} a correct {account of} the {same} to refer to^ shall not readily forget ^on the 24th oct we visited^ Oct [Aug] 24th while we walked to &amp; fro through St
Pauls Cathedral which was 500 feet in length 285 in bredth 404 in highth which was 40 years
in building from 1675 to 1715 which cost 136000 or $3,680,000 ^l,567,076,15. $ 5880,380^ which contains 
47 monuments of fine marble erected over the Tombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals 
Earls &amp; other titles who had distinguished themselves in the military service of Great Brit-
ian &amp; otherwise, Lord Nelsons being the most noted, &amp; while historians have taken much 
interest in the origen of this cathedral dedicated St Paul which was first built by St
Augustine in the year 610, &amp; now considered the largest cathedral in the world excepting 
the Vati[c]an at [[Rome, Latzio, Italy|Rome]] dedicated to St Peter. We ^ourselves^ can clearly see the gentiles are zealous in 
a form of Godliness while they deny the power thereof, for while this church stands in 
honor to St Paul, those who whorship therein utterly reject &amp; deny the principles which 
he tought. Again I think we shall not doubt the words of Soloman when he said man had 
sought ought many inventions esspecially when we reflect back to the 1st day of Sept, when 
We desended together about 40 feet into the Bowels of the earth &amp; walked throught the Thames
Tunnel with the [[River Thames, England|River Thames]] &amp; British shiping over our heads which was opening a thorough 
fare from one shore to the other which was finished 1110 ^feet^ &amp; was lighted with gas, arched 
overhead &amp; considered one of the greatest wonders of the last days. The time we spent 
together on the 5th of Sept Visiting [[Westminster Abbey, Westminster, Middlesex, England|Westminster Abbey]] was not unprofitable, had we 
travled the world oer we could not have found another spot that would have pre-
sented a wider field of knowledge &amp; of contemplation as touching the history of the 
rise, progress, &amp; fall of Kings, Princes Lords &amp; mighty men of Gentile greatness pride 
&amp; boast. This Abbey was composed of eleven Chapels (ownly seperated by walls or petitions)Mr [[Willard Richards|Willard Richards]]

Paid Answred March 3rdto shelter her sins behind. Again the principle of finding fault with a
Brother &amp; or Sister &amp; speaking evil of them behind their backs as a sin that
God hates &amp; if it is not repented of it will bring the curse of God upon
the heads of those that are thus guilty. &amp; I believe their is eviel of this

had evil surmisings both towards you &amp; Sister [[Jennetta Richards Richards|Richards]] &amp; if they do
not scease from those things &amp; spedaly repent their wickedness shall be

it is difficult to deal with such cases whare they are all pointed towa
rds ones own self, but I am more &amp; more convinced &amp; that to
by the spirit of God, that the church Will never prosper in preston untill
they treat you in a different manner from what they are doing at least
many of them, they ought to sympathize with you in your afflicti[on]
&amp; assist you to the necessaries of life, &amp; uphold you by love, confidence

Richards dont be discouraged, the Lord will give you the victory, you
shall overcome &amp; your Enemies shall not prevail against you, I 
will plead with God for you, you shall have my prayers if I can
do nothing more. I would say in all cases of Church dealing it
would be well to persue the gospel course &amp; it appears that you have done
&amp; leave the event in the hands of God. &amp; let us ask God for wisdom &amp;
he will give it unto us. My Love to Sister Richards &amp; all who
inquire a letter from you will meet a welcome reception at
any time Dont trouble yourself about the postage it is but a trifle I
I will pay it. excuse the hasty scribling of this sheet. That health, strength,
faith, grace, &amp; evry needful thing may rest upon you from God our
Father &amp; our Lord Jesus christ is the prayer of your Brother in the Love of God

W. Richards W Woodruffsome excitement &amp; things are working about right now in the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|potteries]]
to have the people hear the word whether they embrace it or not, the priest
are quite mad because we are getting a hold in [[Hanley, Staffordshire, England|Hanly]] we have
a good house to preach in &amp; we have a worthy brother who has rece
ived the work &amp; his doors are opened unto us constantly. he is a Merc-
hant in the place his wife &amp; servent are also members of the Church
We shall have warm opposition in Hanly for it is the seat of
iniquity &amp; pristcraft but the Lord is with us. I preach on the mor
row Sunday in [[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] &amp; [[Lane End, Staffordshire, England|Lane End]] Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Corden]] in Hanly. I receved
a letter from Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] on Thursday he was in [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]]
preaching to his relatives in the family circle. but was soon expecting
to preach in public. he foud hard work to preach to his parents who
had been professors of Godliness 40 years &amp; had great confidence in
their ministers. Brother [[Henry Glover|H. Glover]] has just returned on a visit to
his friends about 50 miles &amp; some rage &amp; fight otherers want the word
&amp; some wish to be Baptzed. But I will close about matters with
us

Now Dear [[Willard Richards|Brother]] with respect to your Difficulty that you spoke of
I will acknowledge I have not had time to meditate upon it &amp; pray about it
as much as I could wish but yet the spirit of God knows all things I
am sensible you have many difficulty things to encounter. I do not
know what better you could have done than the course you have persued con
sidering all circumstances, but one thing is certain sumbody is much
out of the way. In the first place I ask in the name of reason &amp; Revelation
that if Sister D is sick what business Sister C or any other person has to accuse
her of feigning herself sick, the principle is of the Devil &amp; the spirit of God bears
record against it. If Sister C had charity &amp; the Love of God in her soul &amp; was
in the way of her Duty she would go &amp; sympathise with Sister D instead
of speaking against her &amp; that to behind her back such things are agaist
the law of God &amp; iniquity cannot be retained in the church of christ or
at least it should not. The church did right in withdrawing the hand of fel-
lowship from Sister C, &amp; she ought not to be restored unless she will make
an humble acknowledgement of her sins &amp; repent of them before God. if others
had sined ever so much it is no place for Sister C to make a bulwark of[[Stoke-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England|Stoke]] 11 oclock Saturday night Feb 8th 1840

W. Woodruffhas injured him &amp; given us friends. We have held regular meetings on the

I have been informed that the [[Clement Leigh|Rector]] in New Castle is preaching against us
quite a number of Methodist teachers attend our meetings &amp; freequently oppose
but they go away confounded while it begets us friends. We have quite a good
room in Hanly that we have lived for six months, which will be the sta[n]ding
place for the church to meet in on the Sabbath we have vary full &amp; attentive
congregations how many will come out in this regeion I do not know
but the work seams to be prosperous here as yet, their has been a number
baptized since we came, the Church now Numbers between 70 &amp; 870 &amp;
others given in their names. I became convinced it was the will of God
for one of us to go to [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]] &amp; taking all things into consideration
we thought it best for Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] to go. &amp; consequently he left Burslem
for Birmingham on the 28th Jan &amp; I suppose is now labouring in Birmingham
but I have not herd from him since he Left. We are determined by the
assistance of God to open a Door in Every town from the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|Potteries]] to Bir
mingham &amp; erect a Standard in it. I feel as though it will be a day
of warning &amp; not of many words to [[England|England]]. I think that what we do we
shall do quickly. I would here also remark their are a number of Doors

Dear Brother

Though I have no extraordinary information
to communicate to you at this time upon any subject, yet I thought I would
drop a few lines to you this morning, &amp; let you know that I am alive &amp;
enjoying good health, &amp; what I am about &amp;c We arived in [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] the day we
left you, &amp; saw Elder [[William Clayton|Clayton]] &amp; the Saints in good spirits. I was much
pleased with my acquaintance with Brother Clayton I consider him a worthy
Brother a man of wisdom &amp; of God. I was called upon in the evening with Brother Clayton
to go &amp; visit that Sister that has been so much afflicted possessed with the Devil &amp;c. I
do not recollect the name. her husband that was considered under Transgression came
to us &amp; confessed his Sins, &amp; next day made acknowledgments before the church.
When we arived at his house his wife was in a great rage required 3 men to hold her
We lade hands upon her &amp; after a mighty struggle cast the devil out &amp; rebuked
the fever &amp; she was made whole &amp; was at meeting comfortable next day, but
the devil entered into her child next, day &amp; flung it into a dredful agony &amp;
made it as stiff as a stake, we lade hands upon it, &amp; the devil instantly came
out &amp; the child fell asleep. I have herd nothing from them of late. We preached with
them on Sunday &amp; had a pleasant time with them. We left Manchester on 
the 21st &amp; rode to Burslem, &amp; found Elder [[Alfred Cordon|Cordon]] &amp; the Saints well. I found
them meeting with some opposition in Burslem such as getting the candles
&amp; candlesticks flung at their heads while preaching. The rabble generally was lead
by [[John James, Staffordshire|John James]]. We immediately commenced preaching &amp; opening new doors
as we had an oppertunity. One evening while I was preaching in Burslem John James
came with two constables (to keep the peace for he feared the people) while he could read a 
pamphlet exposing Mormonism taking taken from Mormonism unveiled &amp; [[Warren Farr Parrish|W. Parrish]]
letters &amp; [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. pratts]] &amp;c. I helped him to read then what I could, by giving him lights, &amp;
water to quench his thirst, &amp; calling for order while the house was hissing at him

mercy of God we have all been able to reach [[New York|New York]] but we all
arived here nearly penny less but as I have been out into the county the
Lord has put into my hands means sufficient to pay my own fare, but
I feel equally interested in the wellfare of my Brethren that they also may have
means to go on my their way as well as myself. I know the enemy has struggled
hard to prevent the Twelve from filling this mission Will he finally prevail

Phebe From your friend &amp; companion Willford[[Parley Parker Pratt|parley]] for [[Orson Pratt|Orson]] &amp; she said in her letter that [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] &amp; [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] were getting
better, so Brother Pratt told me. You may be assured those words were
precious to me, for I dreamed a few nights before that Sarah was dead but I thought
the dream might not be true, but come through multitude of business
&amp; though. I returned &amp; took supper with Elder Pratt, he has got a good [[Mary Ann Frost Pratt|wife]] she
often speaks of you, the whole family has had the fever &amp; ague in [[New York City, New York County, New York|the City]] but
have got well. I attended meeting at candlelight in Grand Street in the
Columbian Hall which the Saints have higherd hired to hold their meeting in, it
is in the most popular part of the city, rent $9 dollars per Day Parley gave
us a lecture upon the origins of the Indians &amp; [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]]. I had
the happy privilege of taking Brothers [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] &amp; [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] once more by the
hand &amp; found them well, truly the mercy of God has been great unto
us all. [[Brigham Young|B. Young]] &amp; [[Heber Chase Kimball|H. C. Kimble]] was in the state of [[New York|N. Y.]] expet them
in the city every day. After meeting Elder Taylor accompanied me to my
boarding place in King Street &amp; we retired to rest Distance of the Day. 60. m
Thus ended the business of the 11th Day of Dec with me. Yesterday I called
upon [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] at his Store 118 Bleacker Street corner of Woster I found him
well &amp; in good spirits. he had recieved a letter from [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|Father]], [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]], [[Ezra Carter, b. 1804|Ezra]],
[[Shuah Coffin Carter Moulton|Shuah]], &amp; Sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss]] since I last saw him all well in [[Maine|Maine]]
but exceding hard times. Last evening I sat in conference
at Elder P. P. Pratts house in Mott street 58. the conferene was called in
conference consequence of an improper course persued among the churches by
Elder [[Joseph T. Ball|Joseph Ball]] &amp; [[Phineas Howe Richards|Richards]] we did not get through last evening
but meet for the same purpose this evening. The work of the Lord is still
progressing in this country Parley is labouring faithfully in this City both
in public speaking &amp; printing. he has already out of the press 2,500
of the voice of warning. 2,500 of the persecution of the Saints will
soon be out in bound volume, 2,500 of the Book of Mormon I
expect will soon go to press &amp; also he has other works in the press the
work is not ownly progressing in this City. but a great work is opening
in the City of [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] 30 or 40 have been baptized mostly under
the laboursers of [[Benjamin Winchester|B. Winchester]] &amp; hunders [hundreds] are believing Brother Winchester
wished me to call &amp; labour awhile with him &amp; I should have done
so If I had not been suddenly called to this City to have attended this con
ference. Elder O. Pratt has gone to hold a protracted meeting 30 miles
from phila" with Elder [[Lorenzo Dow Barnes|Barns]] I was informed last evening that
that had baptized about 40 during the meeting. &amp; their are many calls for
labourers. &amp;c. The Elders here all wish to be remembered to you &amp; to their
families as far as you have oppertunity to inform them Elder Turley is
writing a letter to [[Frances Amelia Kimberley Turley|his wife]] on the same table with me. Remember meBowery 88. [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York City]], Dec. 13th. 1839.

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]].

Notwithstanding I sent you a long letter about
twenty days since; I feel disposed to address you at this time; &amp; could I
but read a letter from you half as often as I write to you I should feel
exceding thankful: but I make allowances for Sickness &amp; miscarriage
of letters &amp;c. I have recieved one letter from you &amp; that was great consola-
tion to my feelings. This is the fifth letter I have written to you &amp; I
do hope that you have obtained them, the last letter I wrote Nov 24th which
I truly hope you will get. When you write to me please be particular to
tell me how many of my letters you have received &amp; the Dates of them. I
am in great hopes that I shall have a letter from you before I leave the
City for the City [[England|England]]. I never more highly prised the worth of letter writ
ing than since I left home. I suppose of course that you wish to know how
matters &amp; times are with me &amp; have been since I last wrote &amp;c. I contin[ue]d
preaching in [[New Jersey|New Jersey]], had full congregations, many were believing, some 
were embracing, &amp; a warm &amp; friendly feeling manifest by almost the whole
country whare I was. Elder [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] called to see us, preached one, &amp;
informed me that a conference was appointed in New York City on the
12th inst &amp; wished me to attend I have done so &amp; am now in the City.
?the following I copy from my Journal. Dec 11th I took the parting hand with Elder [[Samuel James|James]]
&amp; Brother [[James Ivins|Ivins]] &amp; left them at 1 o'clock at night &amp; rode 16 miles to [[Freehold Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Freehold]]. I
there took Stage at daylight &amp; rode 12 miles to [[Middletown Point, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Middletown point]], there took
Steem Boat Wane sailed 30 miles to N. Y. City arived at 12 oclok. I entered the city
?&amp; found it full of armed Soldiers spedily preparing for war thee Steem Boats
were chartered to conveyed them to [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]] to fight several thousand Du-
Dutchman that ware Citizens near Albany that had strongly fortified themselves
with canon &amp; small arms, it is said they will not pay their tokens or depts or
sumthing or other of that kind, &amp; so they are going to fight about it, how much
?Blood will be shed I dont know. at any rate it is beginning to be war &amp; rum
?our through America &amp; [[Europe|Europe]] &amp; all things are in commotion. After dining
in King stret, I called upon Elder P. P. Pratt in Mott street No 58 found him &amp; fam-
ily well. Elders P. P. Pratt &amp; [[Joseph T. Ball|J. Ball]] accompayed me to the post office. I rece[ived]d
two letters one from [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] all well in [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]]. one from [[Milton Holmes|Milton Holmes]]
he had been quite sick, lost $70 dollars, was very poor, had no decent
clothes, could not go to England, hardest times he ever saw, could not get
a dollar in money, but was gaining in health, was strong, in faith, urged me
to remember him to Phebe &amp;c. &amp;c. I did not get a letter from Phebe but took
one out for [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] from his [[Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt|wife]] in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] I gave the letter to[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] Mills

on earth to have you &amp; the rest of my Kinsman become

taken from the Flora caused by the bursting of the connecting pipes I took water 
at Cincinnati for [[Wellsville, Columbiana County, Ohio|Wellsville]] rising of 400 miles I also passed another boat
that had run against a snag store her hull &amp; sunk at Wellsville I took
the stage to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] 90 miles &amp; whene I arived at Kirtland I was almost
asstonished I at the alteration in the place since I was there in May
1834 for when I left there was but few buildings &amp; most of them shanties
but now on my returen I fou^n^d a city as it were arising from the hills

towards heaven in honor of that God who commanded it be built
&amp; framed the materials of which it was made. It was truly a happy
season to my soul to again meet the inhabitants of Kirtland those with
whom I had endured perils &amp; tribulations I visited the house of the lord &amp;
its contents &amp; I saw that which I did not expect to behold in my generation
&amp; among these things I say the Egyptian mummies &amp; also the Book of 
Abram written by his own hand in ancient form. On last sabbath
I had the privelege of going up to the house of the Lord in Kirtland to 
worship with my Beloved Brethren I kno not ownly had the privilege of
hereing the word of God in company with about 1,000 Saints from the
sacred desk but also of declaring the word of God unto them. my happiness
hath been great to behold the work of God in these last days &amp; Allthough
the gentiles rages &amp; the priest imagin vain things yet the work of God will roll on
in spite of all these things untill babylon shall fall Israel be gathered &amp; Christ

Dear Sir

As I have 
just taken my pen from a sheet directed to our Distant
parents I thought pirhaps it would not be amiss to
address a few lines to you as I have never had any reason to
believe that you had lost that friendship or attachment towards
me that I formerly have been made the partaker of an opportunity
afforded. Notwithstanding years have rolled away between us since
we saw each other face to face yet my attachment towards you
or my desire for your wellfare either in temporal or spiritual things
hath not either lessoned or abated. It certainly is gratifying to 
me to hear of the prosperity of my Brethren in evey lawful
pursuit Brother Asahel I have long felt anxious to again
hear from you I am sensible that it is not alltogether profitable to 
be always pouring upon any ones mind any subject however good
it may be lest be be weary in consequence of which I have remained
more silent upon those subjects in which I have been ingaged than I
otherwise should have done. But thinking perhaps you would like to
Know whare I was how &amp; what I was doing I concluded to call your
mind to the perusal of this sheet. I would here rema^r^k that after
our last conference in the south I spent a few days in visting the 
Churches which God had rased up by my instrumentality in that country
I had a good season amo[n]g them I added 9 to their numbers &amp;
took the parting hand I took water at [[Paducah, McCracken County, Kentucky|Paducah]] K.Y. on the 25 th of 
Oct after passing one boat that had sunk &amp; run aground ourselv[es]
traveled 400 miles we reached [[Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky|Luisville]] I then went by land to [[Owenton, Owen County, Kentucky|Owenton]],
&amp; spent two weeks preaching &amp; visiting some Kinsman of Elder 
[[Abraham Owen Smoot|Snoots]] a travling Brother from [[Tennessee|Tenne]] who is with me we then went
to [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinnati]] visited the big bone lick on the road the place whare
those large bones are taken that have been exhibited in [[Europe|Europe]] &amp;
America. When I arived at Cincinnati My first business was 
to inquire at the store of Webster &amp; Conway for you they told
me you had located at [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terrehaute]] Indianna &amp; I was glad to learn
from them that the prospects for your prosperity was flattering[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] is much pleased with him. I
am as comfortable as I can expect and thin
gs appear favourable for my recoyery.
The people are verry friendly about here. Tell
me how you like his name and whether
you wish it to be different. I feel to give
thanks to my heavenly fater for his kindness
to me rejoice with me Willford. I mis you
more than ever since my confinement

March 1st 1838but they told him that is was between ministers and they did not wish to meddle
with it, but brother [[Isaac Crockett|Crocket]] has come over to this district and says that he is more
calme than he was. I really hope that he will not procede with his suit for it will
only make trouble. I have almost forgotten to tell you that [[Milton Holmes|Milton]] has given up going
to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirt.]] next spring and wants to come down here in the spring. wants to meet you in
[[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]] thinking that you will accompany me there in the spring he wants you
to write to him, says that he wishes he was with you here now. [[Justus Ames|Brother]] and sister
Ames [[Valentine Ames|Valentine]] and [[Melana Ames|Melana]] send there best respects to you and say they are trying to
do as well as they can, I think they are. Sister [[Mary Arey Brown|Brown]] and sister [[Sabra A. Young|Subra]] are here on
a visit and send there love to you and say that the church is doing well there.

They have just come in from meeting and say they have had a verry good
meeting, that brother Crocket was wide awake. You did not say any thing about
the time that you expected to return here, your three weeks have almost expired
and they have been long enough I think. I realy feal lonely here without my [paper torn]
but I trust that the Lord will take care of him and return him to me in
his time. I dont forget to ask him to daily and trust that I am not forgotten
by him. My health is good at present but I have been quite sick with a cold
I was much pleased to hear that brother [[James Townsend|Townsend]] had joined your company
Give my best respects to him and tell him that I want to see him.
Milton?s letter was sealed with black and there was greate enquiery concerning
the contents, but I did not let them know of the Kirtland affairs, some of them
here surmise that a mob has arisen and demolished the press in Kirtland
y but I shall keep the letter private untill you come and then you may
do as you think best with it. I think that these times will try the faith
of the saints but I think that I feal as strong as ever. b There will be
great persecution for thes things but there is a God in Israel yet thanks be
to God for it. I have not commenced your coat yet but shall soon. I recollect
that this is your birthday would be glad to congratulate you upon the same could I have
the privilege. This is from your [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] who is waiting as patiently as she can for your return.
It is most twelve therefore I bid you good night and retire to rest

P.W.W.requests you to let no one but me know of it. he writes in confidence to you. says that
[[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]] and [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]] took their families Saturday night and it is supposed they
have gone to [[Missouri|Missourie]] and the word is for all to follow that possibly can to
escape the destruction that is comeing upon [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|K.]] There is a great division there and
a number have left the church and raised what they call a standard of truth
and liberty and drew up a remonstration against wickedness and the pro
cedings that have been illegally, takeing for their guide the [[Book of Mormon|book of Mormon]] the
bible the and covenants for their guide. I will mention some of their names
[[Nathaniel Milliken|N. Milliken]] and [[Mary Fairfield Hayes Milliken|wife]], [[John C. Gaylord|John Gayland]] and [[Elizabeth Terry Gaylord|wife]], [[Warren Farr Parrish|W. Parish]] and [[Martha H. Raymond Parrish|wife]], J. F.

Coe and [[Sophia Harwood Coe|wife]], [[Sarah Ayer Lowell|Sarah Lowell]], and [[Aphia S. Woodman|Aphia]], and many others but I hope not
Willford and [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]. there was about thirty five that signed the remon
strance, but the letter stated that there was thousands of the same opinion.
The high counsil met and cut them all of[f] from the church. Doct Cowd
ry has withdrawn from the church, the printing office has been taken and sold
for Joseph?s and Sidney?s debts N. Millikens bid it off, therefore we shall not
have the papers at present. I am verry sorry for that for there is much eccitem
ent here already about the delay of the papers and I suppose that they have the same
account here in the papers that you saw, some of them have already written to
the Post Masters in [[Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cleaveland]] and Kirt. to learn the truth of these things although
it is kept private here now. O Willford what is this world comeing to. my heart almost
shrinks within me when I look around on the state of things. Brother [[Joseph T. Ball|Ball]]
has received a letter from his [[Mary Montgomery Drew Ball|Mothers]] family in [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]] requesting him to return
to them and he thinks of starting in 8 or 10 days. I rather expect that he will
baptize Mr. [[Ephraim Grant Luce|Ephraim Luce]] and [[Lucy Fry|Lucy Fry]] as they have been waiting for an oppo-
rtunity most ever since you lelft. Brother [[Justus Ames|Ames]] has had his case tried and the cost
was trown upon him. Mr [[William Douglass|Douglass]] has been in a great rage about you he says
that he will spend all his property in law with you but that he will have his
character cleared up, he has applied to two Justices for an execution against you but[[Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine|Vinalhaven]] March 1st. 1838

Beloved Willford

According to your request, I seat myse
lf this eve to pen a few lines to you after haveing just, returned from father
Luces? (where I have been spending a few days) to brother [[Justus Ames|Amese?s]]. I passed by
brother [[Stephen Grant Luce|Stephen Luces?]] where the brethren have met for meeting, thinking
I would spend the time in writing to you. Brother [[Joseph T. Ball|Ball]] arrived here
last eve, and brought me a billet from you to day which I was glad
to receive. The church here are strong and well engaged likewise the
opposers are engaged to. Mr. Carter has held two mock meetings here of late,
he has a written manuscript which he has been collecting through the
past winter from newspapers &amp;c which he reads to the people with
hymns addapted to the occasion. brother Ames and [[Valentine Ames|Valentine]] attended the
first meetting and bore a noble testimony for the truth they said
they never had so much liberty in speaking before. many people saw
the contrast between the two spirits?but none of the brethren attended
the last meeting. I have received three letters for you but no papers; one letter
was from [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother Woodruff]] bearing date of Dec. 31st. wherein in she says
that she has been quite sick but has far recovered also that [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] and [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father]]
were well and that her faith was encreaseing in the faith of latter Day Saints
and that nothing short of it would satisfy her mind &amp;c. &amp;c. another from
brother [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] wherein he acknowledges the reception of your last
letter. his remarks are more favourable than than sometimes. says that
he heard brother [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]] preach in [[Terre Haute, Vigo County, Indiana|Terra Haut]] last fall &amp;c. The third
was from brother [[Milton Holmes|Milton]] he mentions that your much esteamed letter
came to hand and was gladly received. he had concluded almost that you
had not received his. he likewise received one from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] the same day
dated Jan. 14th. wherein he received information concerning matters in K. heMr Willford Woodruff

you likewise particularly brother [[Thomas Kington|Kingstons]] family I should

time. Do remember me and [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willy]] in all your pray[ers]

So good night my dear W.  
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|P. W. Woodruff]]
Willford Woodruff

I suppose you have no objections to my 
comeing east I was advised to do so by manypay sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] the sum of money I borrowed of her if you sent 
any and left word to have your letters forwarded to me in [[Maine|Maine]] I feel 
verry anxious to hear from you more so since you went to [[London, Middlesex, England|London]]. 
I feel verry thankful that the Lord has blessed you in your ministry in the 
maner that he has since you have been gone from home but Oh! how long 
you have been gone sometimes my heart almost sinks within me when I 
think how long you have been gone and the scenes that I have passed through 
since you left me and was I to dwell upon it I should sink beneath it
but hitherto the Lord has supported me. do tell me when you think 
you will be at home the next time when you write if you can I 
often get quite impatient weighting your return. Could I have taken 
our little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] east with me it seames as though I should have been 
happy but Ah! I had to leave her remains in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] while I went 
east with my little [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willy]] but not without first visiting her grave and strew
ing it with leaves, but I leave this subject. The church in Commerce 
and [[Iowa Territory|Iowa]] is increaseing verry fast som somethings are taking place in 
the church which are bad but bu I will tell you more about it when
you come home which I hope and trust will be in the spring and 
hope you will be prepared fo with meanes to take me back in the spring ^with you^ 
although I expect my friends will be opposed to my going back and 
that was the greatest and only objection that I had to going home perhapse 
they may change my mind upon the subject but I hope not. I want you to 
write often for I think you do not feel as lonely as I do. Father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clark?s]] 
family have been verry kind to me ever since I have been there and they 
wish to be remembered to you. I have sent you as many as eight or nine 
letters since Iyou left [[New York|N.Y.]] and paid the postage on them to N.Y. I feel verry 
sorry that you do not get them. I have not received any papers from you

Dear Willford

I presume you will be somewhat surprised 
when you learn where this letter was written but perhapse not more 
than I was when I went to my door in [[Iowa Territory|Iowa]] and saw brother 
[[Joseph Fabyan Carter|J. F. Carter]] and [[Luther Scammans|L. Scammans]] ride up to the door I could hard think 
it possible that they could be there but truly strange things happen in 
these last days, they came on to see the country and stoped with me about 
6 days and insisted on my accompanying them home and spending the 
winter at home and then if I wished I could return with you in 
the spring so we left [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] on the 16 of Nov. and arrived here yester-
day we have had a good and safe passage thus far and tolerable good health 
our [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|dear little babe]] was some unwell two or three days with the chills and 
fever but I procured some of the tonic mixture and gave him and it helped 
him so he is quite smart now. My health is good accepting some cold occasioned 
by traveling I hope to be comfortably situated  in my [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father?s]] house before you re-
ceive this as we expect to leave here tomorrow for [[Maine|Maine]]. We are now at 
brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Iluse?s]] he has got a verry pleasent [[Martha Sloan Carter|girl]] for a wife about 18 years old. 
You told me in your last communication that you was going to send me 
some money and wished me to spend it in some ^the^ way that would make me 
the most comfortable so I thought that way would be to go home and spend 
the winter with my relatives hope to see you in Maine in the spring 
I packed up my things and left them at father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clarks]] where I have been living 
and left them in their care with my heifer the cow I let a widow woman have 
for her milk she is to keep her for her milk untill my return. I have not heard 
from you since last july or your letter was dated th 6th of July where in you 
mentioned brother [[Theodore Turley|Turley?s]] return home and mentioned writing and sending
me some things by him he had not arrived when when we left but was 
expected daily as we heard he had left [[New York|N. Y.]] with his company for Montrose
but it was getting so late in the season that we dared not wait any longer 
so I borrowed 15 dolls. of sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] and told I saw and engaged sister
[[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] to take charge of the things you sent until our return and to paynan5
are in our city.

I shall be pleased to hear from you as often as you 
have time to write.

The brethren of the Historical corps, and my family
wish a kind remembrance to you and all say, God bless and 
prosper bro. Gibson on his mission.

I remain

to the world: if they differ as widely upon other subjects as they
do upon Mormonism. I would have supposed that if an
Editor in any part of the states had made such a statement
at this advanced stage of Mormonism that he would have been 
considered a fit subject for an insane asylum, for that old Spaulding
story has been fully exploded [exploited] for the last twenty years, and al[l] consider
the author of that contribution either consummately ignorant or wilfully
wicked in presenting such a statement as authentic. Concerning 
utah affairs I will say all is peace and quietude, an abundant
harvest of wheat and a good prospect for all kinds of grain and 
vegetables.

There is some sickness of late. My daughter, Phebe, Mrs. 
Snow, lost an infant born on the 6th inst., all of your family in 
the valley are well. I see Lulah frequently she seems to enjoy good 
health and spirits.

Captn. Burton of the British army, a nobble harder
has been visiting us for some ten days. I accompanied him over
the President's dwellings, gardens, and premises and we also gave
him some Historical items of the Mormon war and other mat-
ters. Hee appears much pleased with his visit to and with 
President Young and friends and of the city in general; he 
takes sketches of the city from the observatory, of President Young's 
beehive mansion. He is much of a gentleman, he has traveled
enough to throw off that prejudice which many feel towards those 
^not^ of their political and religious faith.

or title [tittle] shall fall unfulfilled, and the spirit of the Lord will 
bear testimony unto you that they are true when you read
these lines. And I would exhort you, bro. Gibson to be 
true and faithful unto the Lord your God, call upon him 
in mighty prayer, follow the dictates of his holy spirit and
his blessings will increase upon you daily, and the spirit of 
the Lord will be like fire shut up in your bones and your 
testimony will be strong and powerful before your fellow men 
and you will be enabled to say of a truth that you would
rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God and associate with
the Lord's anointed than to partake of all the pleasures that
are found in the tents of wickedness.

It is your privilege to constantly enjoy the Holy 
Ghost ? to know the mind and will of God concerning you
day by day ? to be led by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit 
in every act of your life. This spirit will reveal to you 
every snare and trap, or evil of any kind that an enemy, 
whether it be men or devils shall lay for your feet, and will suggest 
a way for your escape.

What great blessings the Gospel of Jesus christ vouchsafes
to all who obey its simple precepts and keep the commandments 
of God; yet how few place themselves in a position to appreciate 
these things. But I will stop preaching with my pen and 
re[fer] to some items of news.

From the specimen you sent me of the contents of the
American Biographical dictionary, I judge there will be a wide difference
tween it and the new American Cyclopedia [Encyclopedia] in carrying inteligencenan2
for this is opening wide doors whereby much may be accom-
plished in a short time. Such things will help to ripen the
earth speedily and prepare it for the day of reaping and 
leave the nations without excuse in the day of God's visitations
which are nigh the dor.

I have felt from the commencement of my acquaint-
ance with you that you are one of the instruments the Lord
will make use of in presenting the principles of eternal 
truth before this generation in such a way that they will 
have no power to plead ignorance before the Lord whether they
receive or reject your testimony. And I pray the Lord to bless
you and to inspire your heart, nerve your spirit and fully 
prepare you to magnify that station which you are destined
to fill before this generation; yes, brother Gibson as the Lord
lives you have a great work to perform in your day and 
one too, that will not only cause your heart to rejoice in bearing
testimony of the word of God and the revelations of Jesus Christ and
the principles of life and salvation, but it will cause the hearts of tens
of thousands of the honest of your fellow men to rejoice and be made 
glad because of the testimony which you will have power to bear
with your words and pen, it will also cause the ears of the 
wicked to tingle and their hearts to be pierced with much sorrow 
because of rejecting your testimony and the testimony of others of 
the servants of God.

These things are true, they are the strong whisperings
of the holy spirit unto me, and if you are faithful not one

Brother Gibson:?
Dear Sir:
I received your two letters of 
June 15th, and Aug. 7th, respectively, both of which were highly
interesting and edyfying. I read them to Prisident Young and
council, your daughter, Captn. [Cooper?] and many other friends, 
who were all highly pleased to hear from you. Your daughter
says she writes you very often.

Your letters please me they shew plainly that the 
spirit of your mission is upon you. Your labor in searching
out and stirring up the cold and lukewarm saints in the 
various branches through the country was a good work.

Oceanicus' letter to the mountaineer was published
and read with much interest.

That the Japanese ambassadors to the proud
high-minded Americans, could not find a linguist among the
literate of this great nation, who could speak to them without
an interpreter till they met a Latter-day saint, is rather sig
nificant and adds to the signs that Israel is to be head and
not the tail, and the mighty nations of the earth are begin-
ning to feel a little of the forebodings of this truth, notwith
-standing the present smallness of the little stone or kingdom
which Daniel saw.

The openings in New York for public lecturing, which 
you name, and also publishing. Truth in such extensi[vee]
public works as the new America cy lopedia [encyclopedia?], rejoices my heartwith reguard to my health I never enjoyed better in my life
than I have since I came to [[England|England]] excepting I had some 
thing like the cholera for a bout a week in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]], but got
up sudenly recovered also I was taken sick this day at a 11 Oclo
ck which has terminated in a chill this day and I had too

much pain in my head too write Elder [[James Whitehead|Whitehead]] wrote for
me but give your self no uneasiness about this for it will not 
Continue with me the american Brethren are all well 
and send their respects to you we meet for a general confer
ance tomorrow

Oct 7th we held our conference yesterday had a good time there was 
saints represented &amp; Officers viz Elders P T D I finish this 
letter this morning as Eldr [[Samuel Mulliner|Mullenerr]] is waiting to take it to America I have 
had no more of the effects of the chills or Ague since Monday but feel well

[[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] Engthere was in English laws which are very strct for to inflict
penilty on such Proceedors I proposed to accompanying them some 
of my Brethren into the midst of the mob to see who they were 
that we might get suficient testimony against them but 
they objected to my going lest I should be ingured by a showr of 
stones which fell from every hand like hail however some 
of the Brethren went out themselves into their midst and took 
their names of the leaders of the mob and again returned to 
the house amidst a showr of stones and brick bats but with 
out injury they meeting immediately retired and the mob dispersed 
after we cleared the chambers of brick batts and stones we ret
ired and had a good nights rest this begins to show me something,
of the signs of the times in the Country there has been about 40 saints 
emegrated from [[Fromes Hill, Herefordshire, England|broom hill]] for america which I expect [page torn]
will see some of of them before this letter as there is not room [page torn]

try to be patient my Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] concerning our situation for I am 
inguaged in the work of the Lord and awful is the situation of this 
Generation never did I see such a day as this I have been for days 
like a cart prest under its sheaves with the awful sence of 
the trials and judgements which God has manyfested unto me 
from the Heavens concerning boath saint and sinner but 
let us be faithful and after great tribulation our joy will 
be great and our Glory unspeakable a letter this day has arived 
for [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] from Doctor Foster at [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] which speaks 
of some of the prophecies of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]] which rests upon my mind

this work in a little over six months in the field which I opened 
in last March and the work was never in a more prosperous then 
at the present the work is progressing by the powr of God like fire in 
dry stuble the church Ministers appear to be alarmed in that region 
as there has been four or five church Clarkes and a number musician 
with many of their members Baptised into the church of Jesus Christ 
of latter day Saints the affect of which as been caused them to hold 
public Meetings for the purpose of adopting measures to stop the 
Progress of the work in some instances I have been informed they 
had not more than 15 or 20 for to attend there meetings on the Sabath

and making a short work in [[England|England]] and the like has never been 
known in these Last days as it is at the presant time through all 
parts of this country where ever it is faithfully proclaimed the 
people are begining to have recorse to mob law in some respects 
already Just before I lelt [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]] I met with the saints 
at Elder [[Thomas Kington|Kingtons]] house in [[Dymock, Gloucestershire, England|dymock]] for the purpose of holding 
a prayer meeting and as the saints began to asemble the sound of a 
beet upon Kettles pails and pans was heard through the streets 
and very soon a mob colected of 50 or 100 who payded rank 
and file in from of the house where we were assembled 
we immediately closed our window shutters and door in the 
room where we were I then opened meeting by singing and 
prayer and as soon as we commenced the mob armed themselves 
with stones brick bats and eggs and every thing else they could lay 
their hands upon and began to showr them upon the hous like 
an halestorm for nearly the ^an^ hour they burst in our windows sc
attered brick and stone through the chambers broak the tile 
on the roof and continued such deprodations untill I closed

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Wife]] I once more call your attention to a perusal ^of^ a few 
Lines from me as it as been about a Month since I sent my last which I 
sent with Brother [[Theodore Turley|Turley]]. I have many things upon my mind which I 
should like to communicate to you even more than I should be able to write 
upon this sheet but the remainder I will communicate from time to time 
as I shall have oppertunity if I mistake not my last letter was dated from 
[[London, Middlesex, England|London]] I continued labouring in London in company with Elders Kim
ble and [[George Albert Smith|G smith]] for about 20 days in accout which I will I can only 
speak very brieafly upon at this time we laboured dilligently many days 
before we could find the first soul that was willing to recieve the Gospel 
but when on dilligent search we found the whole City given to priest 
craft idolatry and wickedness of ever discription and every door
closed against us we did not Hesitate to go into the streets and Johna
like cry repentance unto that city and our cry has not been altogether 
in vain for we have sowed seed that will bring forth fruit to the honor
and Glory of God and laid the foundation which will not be removed 
untill the inhabitants thereof are left without excuse and the honest 
in heart and the meek of the Earth are gathered out this I say in the name 
of Jesus Christ the feew days which I spent in London has been the most 
profitablest school to me in many respects of any period of my life

lonely hours, &amp; some gloomy meditations, as you were left alone so long &amp; had no
Relatives to keep you company, I know this is trying &amp; none would have bourn it 
better than you have done possessing that warm attachment to friends &amp; Relatives 
which virtue hath been so perminant in your whole life, Was it in my power 
I would willingly bear your sorrows myself, but as I cannot I am comforted 
with the reflection, that these sorrowful hours are not lade upon you because of 
crime on your part or mine but that we are seperated for the Sake of the 
Gospel &amp; the cause of Christ, If any of our friends are in any more comfortable 
circumstances as to the things of this present evil world in the midst of ease &amp; 
without sacrafice, how will it be a few years hence at the coming of Christ in 
the resurrection the general judgment &amp; in the Eternal World. my object is to be 
on the safe side there, My object is to secure a safe abode in the Eternal world
even a Celestial Kingdom, yes if I can but once see this second to 
myself my wife &amp; childen it will amply reward me for all my toils &amp; labours
my sacrafises &amp; my hours of sorrow in this life, yes I can say wellcome 
all these things If I can but at last obtain the favor of my God &amp; a place 
whare he dwelleth with my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Wife]] &amp; the children which God hath given us.
My constant prayer to god is that he will feed &amp; cloth you, comfort your 
heart, raise you up friends in my absens, &amp; let his angels guard you &amp; give
you grace according to your day in all things &amp; spare your life &amp; the remain
ning child for my sake. I am sorry you have not obtained more of my 
Letters I have written you more than a dozen since I have been in [[England|England]]
&amp; I have received a number from you which has done me much good, I also
sent a large number of letters to you by Elder [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] &amp; the company which 
went with him. (I also ^sent^ you by Elder Turley 7 seven sovreigns with many other things for you &amp;
Sarah Emma &amp; [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willford]], which I trust you have got before time I have others presents for you which I shall bring when
I come, which will be early in the spring if the Lord will) I sent two letters by Elder [[Samuel Mulliner|Mulliner]] to you 
who sailed from [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] on the 15th of Oct for [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] via [[New Orleans, Louisiana|Neworleans]] I also sent a very
long letter for the [[Times &amp; Seasons|Times &amp; Seasons]] by Elder Mulliner it contained an account of 
my travels from the 8th of Aug. 1829 to the 7th of Oct 1840 it covered six side of a mamoth 
sheet as full as I could print it. I mailed another one yesterday for the same purpose

Sleep my child, sleep a while, thy mission thou
hast closed, the debt of nature thou hast
paid and all is well with thee, I well remem
ber an hour, when the earth in a sable shade of 
night was wrap'd &amp; lighted ownly by the moon
thy Parents stood upon a ragged rock, the 
Billows of the mighty deep surged from its 
native element &amp; dashed at their feet spent 
its strength &amp; sunk back in silence. Then 
they spoke of thee, In like manner the hopes 
of thy fond parents thou hast dashed, &amp; returned
in silence to thy native earth but not to be forgo
tten, why all this, Ah Lovely Sarah thy share
of the bitter cup thou hast drank &amp; hid thyself
for a while from the evils of this present 
world though thy pilgraimage to earth was 
short, busy thou hast been in partaking of 
the sacrifices of thy generation, thou
hast shared in the deepest sorrow with thy 
Parents in a journey or two thousand miles
in thy infancy but this is not all thou hast 
made a sacrifice of the society of thy 
father many long months who will meet
thee no more untill clothed in Immortality
In honour to thee my child thy Father drops 
a tear by the midnight lamp in [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] while 
naught but the watchmans voice is herd.
Then rest my child yes Sarah rest untill with thy 
parents thou shalt rise clothed with Immortal

Extract of W Woodruff Journal Oct 18th After bearing testiment 
to the Saints in London, &amp; feeling a witness that there would 
be a good work in this city. We retired to rest in good season
I felt well in my mind &amp; slept untill 12 oclock at night
I awoke &amp; meditated upon the things of God untill near 
3 oclock &amp; while forming a determination to warn the people 
of London &amp; overcome the powers of darkness by the assi
stance of God, A personage appeared unto me which I 
considerd to be the prince of Darkness or the Devil. he made 
war with me &amp; attempted to take my life he caught me by 
the throat &amp; choaked me nearly to death he wounded me in 
my forehead I also wounded him in a number of places 
in the head As he was about to overcome me I prayed 
to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ for help, I then 
began to have power over him, the Lord sent his Angels 
unto me who deliverd me by wounding my enemy &amp; driving
him from me one personage dressed in white who I thought 
was a friend i had seen before came to me prayed with me 
&amp; healed me. &amp; I was instantly made whole &amp; deliverd As soon 
as I could speak I awoke Br [[George Albert Smith|Smith]] who was also in trouble52 Ironmonger Row, [[St Luke&apos;s, Middlesex, England|St Lukes]], London. Octr. 30th 1840.

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]],
I received your kind &amp; affectionate letter ^written^ in the midst of
affliction &amp; mourning under Date of July 18th 1840. truly your
letter brought tidings which were painful &amp; sorrowful to me, but
notwithstanding this it was not without its joys, For while I keenly 
felt the [roots], &amp; to mourn the Loss of the lovely flower which God had lent
unto us a few days &amp; then taken it away in an hour that was best calcu
lated to try the feelings of a kind &amp; affectionate Mother &amp; an absent Father
&amp; while I felt to sympathise with my Dear Companion who alone had been 
called to watch her tender ospring in my absence &amp; behold her life depart &amp; follow
her remains to the grave without a single relative to mingle a tear, you in the 
midst of this affliction meditation &amp; sorrow I truly rejoice before the Lord, I rejoice
that God hath taught us the principles of life &amp; Death, time &amp; Eternity, the Resurrection 
&amp; the judgment. I rejoice that we are not Called to mourn without hope, but
that we have the fulest assurance that we shall meet our [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Child]] in the first resurrection
As we have got to come up through great tribulations in order to inherit
the Celestial kingdom of God, I rejoice that in all these trials, sacrifises losses
&amp; crosses, we have one the less to go through. I again rejoice that God hath
given you grace, strength &amp; fortitude, to support you in the midst of 
this deep affliction, &amp; it hath been the highth of my joy, sweetened all my lonely
lonely meditations, &amp; filled the days of my consolation to know that God hath
granted me a companion in this life who hath been willing to make evry sacrafice 
which God hath lade upon her for my sake for the sake of Christ &amp; for the sake of 
a celestial kingdom whare we shall reign forever, whare the wicked &amp; ungodly
will scease from troubling &amp; the weary be at rest, yes my Dear Companion
in affliction, you may rest assured, the whole spirit of your letter the resignation
you manifest gives me great joy. I know your sorrow, trials &amp; afflictions are
keen, &amp; sacrifices great. Why is it there with you, with me &amp; with the Saints at large
in evry age of the World. Ah the first resurrection will tell, the judgment of 
the great day will declare, &amp; the Celestial glory of God will more fully illustrate
the truth of all these things unto you then I can possibly do with my pen
the Lord Jesus suffered &amp; desended below all things, the Holy prophets &amp; Apostles 
in evry age of the world have suffered greatly &amp; come up through tribulations
in there day &amp; now we have ours, &amp; we shall find at last that all our sufferings 
trials, &amp; privations are ownly to prove us &amp; more fully prepare us to rightly
prise that rest, comprehend the glory, &amp; enjoy the fulness of that reward which we shall receive
at the end of the race, Then under this view of things shall we not kiss the rod &amp; be
resigned, I can exclaim yes with every feelings of my Soul, I can say with my
Dear Wife the Lord hath given &amp; the Lord hath given &amp; the Lord hath taken
away &amp; blessed be the name of the Lord. I I can but bear evry trial that I am
called to pass through in this life as well as I have the Death of Sarah Emma I shall bee
thankful, she was a beautiful flower, I loved it with all all my heart but as willingly
resigned it to God. I shall never forget the last look she gave me when I took the parting 
hand with her. The first intimation I had of her death was on the 22d of Oct several 
letters was sent me from [[Manchester, Lancashire, England|Manchester]] one of which was from Elder [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] &amp;
while reading over the list of the Deaths among the Saints Sarah Emma Woodruff
caught my eye, it produced a peculiar sensation in my mind which went through 
me like electricity yet my nerve was firm I continued reading as though nothing 
had happened &amp; from that moment to the present I have felt perfectly resignedMrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]]

Land it is beginning to progress like fire in a day Stubble We have wrote to the president
of the Seventies to send us 20 of the quorum &amp; also wrote for some High priest.
Notwithstanding we have Baptized about 500 whare I am now labouring, yet it does not

writing, trouhing, keeping journals, &amp; all together gives me but little time to
rest But I never enjoyed Better health or Spirits than at the present time. I am
now at Elder Thomas Kingtons whare we make it our home he was the superintendent
of 45 preachers &amp; the Same number of licensed preaching places. I Baptized him with
the other preachers which have opened those doors for us to preach in I Baptized Brother Kington

[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] it does my Soul much good to see your resignation to the will of God
in the midst of our seperation. The Lord is blessing me labours much in this land, be
patient untill we meet again, you shall not loose your reward, for your reward
shall be to stand with me in Zion with the children which God shall give us. &amp; enjoy
each others society with our children for one thousand years while Christ reigns
&amp; then to inherit the earth together to part no more. &amp; enjoy far greater glories
&amp; Blessings than the present state of things can afford. I think this will a[paper torn] repay us
for any sacrifice we can make for a few years. Pray for me that I may be humble in
the midst of prosperity as well as adversity. I feel a great desire to do the will of God in
all things. My prayer to God is that health &amp; strength, grace &amp; resignation to the will of God
may continue with you &amp; the children which God has given us unto the end. &amp; Also that
God will Bless [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]] &amp; his councillors with means, wisdom, &amp; power to do the work of God in
Zion &amp; her stakes. &amp; that all the Saints may be Sanctified by a Celestial Law is the prayer of
Willford Woodruff

Remember me to [[Brother Meacham|Brother Meacham]] I know how to sympathize with him with a broken leg. You ask me if I
can tell you when I shall come home No Phebe I cannot tell you now but I shall return to the
bosom of my family as soon as the Lord will. I expect quite a number of the saints will go to America
from [[England|England]] this fall. We probably shall know more what the will of God is concerning us in few months
hence. we have made some enquiry of Joseph (by letter) concerning us we expect to hear from him before
long. the Lord is getting some strong holds in this country we are laying the foundation for a mig
hty work here, two or three of us think of visiting [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] immediately after the conference if the Lord will
&amp; setting up the work there. write as soon as you get this &amp; give me all the knews &amp; tell me how
you &amp; the children get along direct to [[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]], [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], [[England|England]]. I ever remain your Willfordhome it will be so much less care &amp; trouble than it will be to see to your own
wood water &amp;c. this is simply my present feeling upon the subject, Remember me with gratitude
to [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Brother Clark]]. &amp; tell him for me that if he feels willing to lend you the hand of assistance in
this your time of need &amp; let you tarry with him untill my return, that he shall not
loose his reward &amp; he shall have my prayers &amp; Blessing &amp; the Blessing of God shall rest upon
him &amp; his children, &amp; his childrens children untill the latest generation, could I
have the privilege of being with my own family I would not trouble any person with
them, But a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me in common with my
Brethren &amp; required at our hands in consequence of which my family must be assisted by
some one in time of need. &amp; I say again in the name of Jesus Christ that that soul
who does good to my wife or children while I am in the vineyard of the Lord doing his work
shall be blessed of the Lord &amp; no power shall take it from them, &amp; I feel vary thankful
to Brother Clark for his kind offer. Give my respects to the [[Polly Keeler Clark|Sister Clark]] you speak of &amp; also Brother
Clarks Son, Remember me to [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Bror]] &amp; [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Sister Smoot]], &amp; Brother [[Lyman Wight|L. Whight]] &amp; family should you see them
&amp; all enquiring friends I rejoice to hear of the progress of the work in America &amp; the prospect of
the Saints being rewarded for their loss by the government. I was much pleased with your
letter it contained much news. I gave you an account in my last letter of my
opening a new field in the South part of [[England|England]], in [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], the work of the Lord
has continued to roll on from the time I first commenced preaching in this part of the
land untill the present time in a manner that I have never before seen it in these last
days, it is not yet 3 months since I first lifted up my voice to preach to the people in
this part of England a region which had not herd the sound of it before but now conta
ins a Church of 500 Saints, with about 50 Elders &amp; priests. about 50 of which 
were preachers of the orders of the day, I have administered Baptism to about 300 of
the Saints above spoken of, &amp; Elders [[Brigham Young|Young]] &amp; [[Willard Richards|Richards]] &amp; the Elders &amp; priests which
we have raised up in this Branch have Baptized the other 200, &amp; the field which is opened
here is so large &amp; extensive that it seems as though the work had but just began
here &amp; I expect hundreds will be added to the Church here. It is rapidly opening
doors in all the Surrounding country in the South of England &amp; also in [[Wales|Wales]] we have
Baptized some few in the Border of wales. We have this day receeved the first No of the

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]],
I take this method to inform you that on last Saturday
night the 30th of May, just as I had retired to rest in company with [[Willard Richards|Elder Richards]]

Dated March 8th &amp; 22d &amp; most of these letters was full of glad tidings so much
so that it drove sleep from our eyes for the night. &amp; we both felt more like going
into the street &amp; shouting Hallalujah than we did like being wraped in Sleep. You may
rest assured it created no small degree of joy in my mind to receave a letter from
your hand for it is the first word I have recieved from you &amp; the ownly one since
I saw you excepting one letter which I receved from you while in [[New York|New York]]. I have not

in [[Europe|Europe]], met at the above namd place, &amp; we had an interesting day; there

40 churches represented, containing 2,495 members, 59 Eldes, 122 Priests, 61 Teachers, 13 Deacons, 
making an increase of about 824 members, 25 Elders, 70 priest, 23 Teachers, &amp; 5 Deacons, during
the last three months; &amp; 374 members, 9 Elders, 50 Priests, &amp; 13 Teachers of the above number, were 
added in the Herefordshire churches in which ^where^ I had been labouring. But the foundation is 
now la^i^de in such a manner in this country, &amp; new Doors opening in England, Scotland, 
[[Ireland|Ireland]], &amp; [[Wales|Wales]], so that we have evry reason to expect a greater increas for the months 
to come, than has been in the thee that are past.

I pray God to roll on this work in 
mighty power in this country &amp; in all Nations &amp; enable us to be humble in the 
midst of prosperity, &amp; work righteousness with all diligence while the day last, &amp; learn

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]

Having the privilege of sending letters by a friend who is going direct 
to [[New York|New York]] I will improve the opportunity of again sending a few lines to you 
which will ^be^ Mailed at [[New York City, New York County, New York|New York City]]. My last letter which I wrote you was Dated 
June 8d in which I informed you that I recievd your letter under Date 
of March which was of much interest to me which is the ownly letter that I have 
as yet receievd from you since I have been in [[England|England]]. But I am 
now expecting letters from you every Day &amp; I trust I shall not be 
disappointed in obtaining one from you soon. I am in hopes we shall 
not be under the necessity of waiting so long for letters from each other 
as we have done here to fore, for when we are begin to obtain letters in exchange 
I hope to obtain letters from you as Often as one in a Month for I shall 
endeavor to write as often as that &amp; hope you will do the same. I have 
and shall have much that I would like to communicate to you from 
time to time.

I am enjoying the best of health &amp; spirits, &amp; am happy; 
&amp; I never enjoyed myself better while in the vineyard of the Lord. &amp; could 
I Behold the faces of my wife &amp; children often, it would greatly add to 
my joy &amp; consolation: But Knowing that we shall have our reward for 
all the sacrafices that we are called to make in this life, for Christ sake, &amp; 
for all that we do in his cause &amp; y Vineyard, causes me to be reconciled 
to his will. I wrote a letter to Prsdt [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in company with 
Elder [[George Albert Smith|G.A. Smith]], &amp; [[Theodore Turley|T. Turley]], June, 27th, In which I gave him a Brief accou
nt of my labours in the vineyard.

We have held two conferences of late, in the 
South of England where I have been labouring; the first was held at the [[Gadfield Elm Chapel, Pendock, Worcestershire, England|Gadfield Elm Chapel]], in ^wor^ wostershire ^wosce^ ^worcestershire,^ England, June 14th. Elder [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] was with me, we had an inter
esting time, we organized 12 churches, &amp; transacted much business; the other 
was held on the 21st of June, at [[Stanley Hill, Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Stanly Hill, Herefordshire, England]]. Elder Richards &amp; myself 
conducted the meeting, or conferene with the help of God. &amp; I never saw more 
business executed in one day, than on that occasion. We organized 20 churches, Ordained 4 Elders, 7 Priest, &amp; 4 Teachers; Baptized 10, Confirmed 20, &amp; Blessed 20 children, 
besides a multitude of other business, &amp; broke bread to several hundred Saints, &amp;c. 
The work had been so rapid, it was impossible to ascertain the exact No. belonging 
to each branch, but the whole Number is 33 churches, 534 members, 75 officers, viz; 
10 Elders, 52 Priest, 13 Teachers, all of which had imbraced the work in less time thanMrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]]

Notwithstanding he is but 17th years of age he is clothed with the power of the Priesthood

day left his native country &amp; started on his voyage of 16000 [10000] miles yet he is filled 
with rejoicing &amp; his soul is made glad, which is fully manifest in a letter which 
has just reached us from his hand exhorting us to be faithful &amp; pray for him

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Companion]]

As I have occupied one of two pages as you will find in other 
letters in conversing about temporal matters &amp; things of miner consequene I feel
disposed to fill this page in expressing my feelings unto you upon the great plan
of Salvation, sumthing of my present expectations &amp; an account of the work in this
Land. When I take into consideration the day &amp; generation in which we live even in this 
last dispensation &amp; fullness of times, the awful calamity that awaits the gentile
Nations of the present age, The Allmighty work of God that is to be accomplised before 
the Comeing of Christ, the esstablishing of Jerrusalem in her power, &amp; Zion in her 
glory, the pruning of the vineyard once more for the last tine, &amp; form some small 
view of those greater misteries &amp; glories of the Celestial Kingdom which are not lawful to 
be w[ri]tten &amp; are yet to be revealed, &amp; having a dispensation of the gospel committed unto 
me in common with my Brethe which is ^to^ accomplish the great work of God which
he has set has hand, ^to do^ I say when I comprehend these things I do not summon words
that God has call us to make such great sacrafices in these last days, I now see the
greater the sacrafice the greater the crown [FIGURE] The ancient Saints of God have been called 
to make great sacrifices that they might comprehend a Selestial Glory, then if 
we enjoy the same glory we are called to make a sacrafise also, &amp; have we 
not done it, yes verily we have equal to any people that ever lived according to the tine
we have been a people, or church of Christ I cannot make a greater sacrafise
than the society of my wife &amp; family ^children^ but notwithstanding this sacrifice is of of the 
keenest kind to my wife as well as myself yet does my Bosom friend in her heart
ever for a moment wish me to scease doing the will of God, or in the least to tarnish
our future &amp; eternal glory, or to dim our crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord-
Jesus No I will not for a moment believe it. Then my Dear friend &amp; companion still 
continue patient untill my return which will be as soon as is the will of God
though we are seperated a few days here yet we shall reign &amp; live together 1000 years
with the children which God shall give us &amp; also with our Lord Jesus Christ &amp; 
we shall also enjoy each other society in a Celestial Kingdom to part no more
We now laying the foundation here of a great work even directly or indirectly
among all the gentile Nations. M ^our^ present intention is to spend the winter in [[Europe|Europe]]
&amp; return to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] in the Spring it is a great voyage &amp; journey from

their winding sheets al of which are car[ve]d out of solid marble is as neatly executed as any
thing found in [[Europe|Europe]] Almost every thing about it is carved out of solid fine marble. the whole
pulpit with all its trimings &amp; hangings &amp; deorations is carved out of one solid stone. There is a large
organ in the building &amp; the church of England still worship there &amp; hold a meeting twice every day
in a year We stayed though one service. We also have been on to the top of [[Malvern Hill, Worcestershire, England|Malvern Hill]] which is
the most Noted Hill in England in consequene of it being the highest Hill in England &amp; the most

My [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Dear Companion]], in all our sacraifices, afflictions sickness, sorrow, &amp;
persecutions let us strive to be patient &amp; resigned to the will of God in all these
things I am well aware that these things are not joyous but grievous for a moment
but afterwards it will yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto those that
are exercised thereby. Let us not think strange that our afflictions are multiplyd
upon us for it is through tribulations that we inherit the Kingdom &amp; we have but little
time to pass through these trials &amp; tribulations before the scene will be closed &amp; joy
will come &amp; we shall enter that rest that remains for the Saints [page torn] the Lord will
make a short work in the Earth this last time. &amp; our sorrows will not be lengthened
as many of the Ancients were for the want of time which may account for our having
so many of them in quick succession. I have had much joy &amp; consolation vibrate
my bosom in my lonely meditations while walking over the parks, fields &amp;, hills of England
even at the thought that I have a companion that thus far has not hesitated to make

any of our people &amp; when they came to the house whare I was I had put on a change of clothing
to go to the pool to baptzed a preacher that had baptized recevd my testimony I invited them into the
room whare I was &amp; I asked them what their business was with me. they said they had come
to learn who I was &amp; who had sent me &amp; what message I had for them &amp; the people. I then
stood up &amp; taught them Jesus Christ &amp; the first principles of the gospel &amp; testified of the Book
of Mormon &amp; the great work which God had set his hand to accomplish &amp; while I was
yet speaking the spirit of God rested upon us &amp; bore testimony unto them of the truth of
my words &amp; they bowed down &amp; prayed &amp; gave glory to God for his marvelous work &amp; they
rose up &amp; the Charriot stood still while all four of these preachers went down into the
pool &amp; I Baptzed them &amp; lade my hands upon them &amp; they recevd the Holy Ghost &amp; went
their way rejoiceing. I went into the town of Ledbury to preach for the first time
&amp; as soon as the people herd that I was in town they gathered together in companies wanting
to hear, the Baptist Minister offered to open his Chapel for me &amp; he went into the pulpit with
me &amp; opened the meeting by reading the 35 chapter of Isaiah &amp; praying mightyly for the Lord to bless
me &amp; make me an instrument of doing much good after which I arose &amp; preached to[[Ledbury, Herefordshire, England|Ledbury]], [[Herefordshire, England|Herefordshire]], [[England|England]], April 24th, 1840.

My Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]]

I again appropriate a little time to fill a sheet to you. which I shall
mostly take up in giving an account of the work of the Lord in this Country. I wrote you
a long letter while in [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]] at the [[Staffordshire Potteries, Staffordshire, England|potteries]], but whether it has fallen into your hands or
not I do not know. You have been anxious No doubt to hear from me from time to time, &amp;
I have been equally as anxious to hear from you, but I do hope that you have not been as
much disappointed in your desires in this thing as I have in mine for though I have written
to you as often as once a month since I left home, yet I have not seen the first mark
of your pen but once since I last saw you, &amp; then you &amp; [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] was both sick in bed
&amp; you must realize that my desire has been vary great to hear from you Sisters [[Frances Amelia Kimberley Turley|Turley]] &amp;
[[Thankful Gill Clark|Clark]] both wrote to their husbands &amp; their letters arivd safe &amp; I was in hopes to have herd a
word about you some way but in this I was also disappointed, I do not make these remarks wishing
to cast any reflections at all for I presume you have written several Letters to me since
I left home but they must have been lost by the way somewhere. But I want you s[t]ill
to continue to write to me often for I may obtain some of them. I want to hear from you
&amp; little Sarah vary much. I continued Labouring in Staffordshire about the Potteries untill
the first of March when I left the church in that place in the care of [[Theodore Turley|Elder Turley]] numbering nearly
one hundred &amp; I went into the South part of England about 80 miles from the Potteries or whare the
word had been preached at all &amp; I made a stand near Ledbury in Herefordshire[.] it is about 40
miles from [[Birmingham, Warwickshire, England|Birmingham]], 30 from [[Bristol, Gloucestershire, England|Bristol]], 100 from [[London, Middlesex, England|London]] &amp; bordering upon [[Wales|Wales]], I commenced
Working &amp; the Lord worked with me in a wonderful manner I first stoped at Mr [[John Benbow|John Benbow]]s a large
farmer he was cultivating 5 or 600 acres of Land[.] his Brother [[William Benbow|William Benbow]] went from the potteries
with me to his Brothrs I expect you will soon see him in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] or [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] for he has gone to
America &amp; will call upon you. I arivd at John Benbows on the 5th of March I preached at
his house on the 5th &amp; was convinced that their was many that would come into the church I also preached
on the 6th &amp; Baptzed 6 persons 4 of which were preachers of the United Brethren of the Methodist order, John Benbow &amp; [[Jane Holmes Benbow|wife]] were baptized

After labouring here one Month I receivid a letter from Elder
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] stating that the Twelve had just arivd from
[[New York|New York]] &amp; I must come immediately &amp; meet with them in
conference at [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] &amp; so I left this part of the vineyard &amp; travled 160 
miles to Preston &amp; attended a conference with the 12 &amp; the church in general 
&amp; had an interesting time. I was truly happy to meet our Brethren from
America &amp; immediately after the conference I returned accompaned by Elder 
[[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] &amp; Elder [[Willard Richards|W. Richards]] will soon join us in this vast field that 
is now open before us I never have seen such a vast field for labour
as the Lord has enabled me to open where I now am since the church was
first established either in America or England. I preached here one month
&amp; 5 days &amp; baptized the superintendant of the Church of the United Brethren &amp; about
45 Preachers of the same order with about 120 of the members making about
160 in all, &amp; this senery has flung into my hands or under my care &amp;
superintendancy more than forty esstablished places of preaching which are
licensed according to Law including one or two chapels &amp; their is now about
200 ready to be baptized as soon as an opportunity offers I have Baptized some  
here of most classes rich as well as poor. a Number of large farmers
I have Baptized from 8 to 13 the first time I have preachd in several places
The Lord of Hosts has been with me &amp; much of the convinceing spirit
of God has accompaned the word. The whole country was immediately
stired up[.] the Ministers was of England of the Church of England I was inf
ormed held a council upon the subject to stop me in my preaching &amp; also
the work one of the Church Ministers called upon the constable of the parish to
take me up but he called upon the wrong man for he had recievd my testimony &amp; I had baptzed
him. but as they cannot stop me by either the Law of the Land or the word of God, I have been [in???d][.]
they offer to Baptize those of their own church if they desire it this is done thinking to save them from
joining us for I have baptized a number of their ^members^ churches. I have had vast congregation out to my
meeting both priest &amp; people. their will spedily be a mighty work in this country I think there[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] I T.

seem much pleased with their situation they appear to be worthy people I think mu
much of them perhapse more for haveing been acquainted with you, he said you told
him you thought you should see him in Amrica in about one year from that 
time which was last April I count the time verry particularly up to that time
O my dear W. must I wait longer than that time to see you, [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|br. Joseph]] says that the Lord does
not require a man to be from his family more than a year at one time. brother 
[[Orson Hyde|O. H Hyde]] and [[John Edward Page|J.E. Page]] have started on a mission to the Jews have been gone about 5 months 
and have not got near [[New York|N.Y.]] yet they are going to [[England|Eng.]] and then to constan
tinople, - if you do not get the [[Times &amp; Seasons|times and seasons]] I would just say that there
is verry interesting letter in it from the Jews, it is lengthy and you would be high
ly edefied to have a perusal of the whole of it but I can only give you some items 
from it, They say the Lord has oppened the way where by they might get possession 
of their beloved citty and they lost no time but exerted themselves to rebuild their beloved 
citty and the undertakeing prospered in their hands so that they have completed
the Medrash and greate is the glory of the house and also of the houses of the teachers
of the law and they have authorized one Aaron Selig Ashkenazi to go forth with a 
proclamation to all their brethren soliciting them to come and assist them they 
seam greately rejoiced at their present prospects. There has been an Indian his wife
and daughter baptize in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] last April they were much pleased with the book
of mormon and said every word of it was true he was an interpreter for 6 tribes he 
said that his brethren would receive the work every one of them they come 6 or 7 
hundred miles to be acquainted with it. Brother Joseph has been dilivering a course 
of lectures of late upon the eternal judgment the eternity of matter &amp;c &amp;c I often thought 
how interesting they would have been to you as well as others he made it so plain 
that a child could understand it ? the work is progressing in every part of America
but not as fast as in Eng. I showed your letters to brother Joseph there was quite a 
number present he to^ld^ them to give audience while the last one was red as I had 
shown him the others before they all gave attention and was much pleased with
the contents none more so than Joseph he wants me to let him see your letters which
I have done he says he would not leave his family so but would take them with him
if he took them on his back ? The church began to build a house on the other side of 
the river ^for us^ but they do not think of finishing it this fall sister [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] has moved into 
her house on that side but it is not quite finished the body of ours is up to the roof and there
it stands sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor's]] is not finished sister Pratt had one bought for her ? brother 
[[George Albert Smith|G.A. Smiths]] [[John Smith, b. 1781|father]] lives in our house in Lovely street I did think of moveing there this 
fall but expect now to stay where I am now untill you return as [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father Clark]] has 
made me welcome he says tell br. Woodruff I that he will take as good care of me as he can 
and he wants you to get as many souls as he can sends his respects likewise, ? we 
have had a wedding in the family her[e] of late that sister [[Lurena Church Clark|Church]] that I mentioned in 
my March letter has lately been married to one of father Clark?s sons [[John Wesley Clark|John Wesly]] 
the[y] send their respects to you likewise all the family. Sister?s Young Taylor [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] 
Pratt Clark Turley and Hadlock and families are well likewise br G A Smiths fathers 
and family he wishes me to say for him that he has lately received a letter from 
him and answered the same. my he My health is quite good at present and has been 
since last june when the fever and ague left me little [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willford Owen]] has got it now and 
it is hard for him but I think he will get over it hope so at least he and I needs 
a large share in your prayers that we may be supported by the grace of God. I have sold my 
youngest calf the cow does do as well this season as last. I should be muchfor 
pleased to have you get your likeness taken if you can. The next time you go to Eng. I want to go 
with you I have not forgotten your promis of staying at home 3 years after we were 
married and I presume you have not ? yet when you come home we will talk about 
those things. I have not yet received those papers you mentioned the Millennial 
star but earnestly hope I shall as I feel anxious to see them. I feel verry sorry 
you do not get the times and seasons, I want you to write often. as brother William 
Clark wants to write some to you I must soon give way for him he will occupy 
the next page he is father Clark?s oldest son at home and a worthy man so I must 
close by wishing you further prosperity and that the grace mercy and peace of 
God may rest upon and preserve you from all evil accidents and harm and enable 
you to fill your mission in meekness and the love and fear of God and return you 
safely to the bosom of your family is the daily prayer of your true friend
W. Woodruff [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|P.W. Woodruff]]

You sell tell me to kiss the children for you that I did verry often before little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] 
died and she used to kiss me many time for pa,pa, as she called you and a little before 
the breath left her body she kissed me for you and little Willo as she called him I wish 
you could have seen her she was much mor interesting the last 2 weeks of her life than 
before because she learned to talk much she possessed a lovely disposition you would 
have been pleased with it. I often kiss little Willford Owen for his pa. and think 
the poor child never had the privilege of seeing him but hope he will ere long - la it is 
said he resembles his mother much, he grew finely before he was sick. If you could 
get me a wrought muslin or lace cape I should be much pleased with it. If little 
Sarah could have lived I should have thought ^my^ troubles and afflictions were 
light but now I think they are serious. Please give my respects to all of the Amer
ican brethren and the Saints around you particularly to br. [[Thomas Kington|Kingston]] and family 
where you make it your home. So farewell dear W.
you know I want to see you dont you

My Dear Willford,

With pleasure I seat myself at this time to 
acknowledge the reception of your kind letter which came to hand 10 days since
and I should have answered it immedately after its reception had it not been that my
babe was quite sick but he is better now I had been an[x]iously looking for a letter from you 
for a long time and to my greate satisfaction received it from the hand of a brother, brought 
by some of the brethren from [[England|Eng.]] on the 27th of Aug. 4 families arrived in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] from
Eng. and report says that 30 families more stopped in [[Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio|Cincinata]] Ohio for a little season
to labour and obtain more means to bring them here. I was truly glad that you recei
ved that letter you spoke of that I sent you in march for I conclude you must feell verry
an^x^ious to hear from home judging you by myselfe for if I do not get a letter from you of
ten I get quite uneasey ? this is the 7th letter I have sent you since you left N [[New York|N.Y.]] I have
taken much pains to write you since you left home and much lament that you have 
not received my letters, for I have written them verry full and one was a long sheet like your
mamoth sheet-filled full, I wrote you once in Jan. then in Mar. then in Apr. then 
in May then June then July then this in Sept ? the April letter I sent by brother [[Orson Hyde|O. Hyde]] 
and [[John Edward Page|J. E. Page]], who who started soon after the April conference on a mission to the ^Jews^ via
of Eng and the one in july I sent by brother [[Lorenzo Snow|L. Snow]] containing an acount of Sarah
Emma death he expected to go d^i^rect to Eng. and I hope you have received that one this
time, one I directed to you in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] in the care of [[John Taylor, b. 1808|J. Taylor]] thinking you would be more 
likely to get it. You say you have sent me 4 letters since you arrived in Eng. I 
have received them all and they brought much news, and afforded me and others much
satisfaction for all the brethren and sisters seam anxious to hear from Eng. and I
with them rejoice with you much in the prosperity of the work with you and that the Lord is 
blessing you labours and the brethren?s there - The work rolls on there swiftly but the 
time of your absence seames long to me it is 13 months today since I last saw you and it seames 
to me to be almost an age but I will try to wait patiently your return which I know will be as soon 
as the Lord^?s will^ is done with you there and did I not know that the Lord required you to be in his vine
yard I could not endure your absence but the Lord has promised strength equal to our day 
and I find he has fulfilled that promis to me, for I have been enabled the most of the time
to be contented and reconciled to my situation although I have had much sickness and a 
severe trial to pass through in looseing my little Sarah even in the absence of her father the little 
dear had no relatives to follow her to her grave but her mother and [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|little brother]] whome she
tenderly loved, she d there was quite a number of the brethren and sisters accompanyed me but
it was a peculiar trying scene for me, more so because of your absence she did not forget her pa,pa, 
for she used to call him many times in a day, but I trust she rests from the toils and 
troubles of this life. I have not heard from [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father Carter]] or [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father Woodruffs]] house
hold for sometime, but lately learned by a letter from br. [[Dwight Webster|D. Webster]] that [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] had late 
ly received a letter from you and that she had been unwell but was better, the others 
were well br. Webster went to the south in june in company with br. [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] as far 
as [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] he makes good progress in the work and is pleased with his calling 
br he thinks of spending the winter in the south if so he will be ordained an eld. and 
have charge over the churches there, thus writes br. Smoot to his [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|wife]] and says he 
and br W. has baptized 15 he (Smoot) is soon expected home and will bring his mother 
in law [[Esther Hunter McMeans|McMeanes]] with him he and his wife send their respects to you likewise 
br [[Albert Smith|Albert Smith]] and rejoices in the progress of the work with you also br. S. Smith 
and wife. Br. D. Webster spent a week with me in june I suppose you know
of the engagement between him and sister E. Woodruff he told me of it himselfe when
he was here. I think him to be a fine man and will make a worthy companion 
he wrote some in a letter that I was writing to you when he was here.

The siskness in Montrose and Commerce is not so greate as it was last season
but there has quite a number died this season some of which I know [[Seymour Brunson|Seymour Brunson]], 
widow [[Sarah Burt Beman|Beman]], [[Jonathan Harriman Holmes|J. Holme?s]] [[Marietta Carter Holmes|wife]], [[John Portineus Greene|J.P. Green?s]] [[Rhoda Young Greene|wife]], Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]], and [[Harriet Pamela Partridge|daughter]],
[[Sidney Rigdon|S. Rigdon]] and father [[Joseph Smith, Sr.|Joseph Smith]] are verry low, and many others that I do not
know I had our little Sarah buried in Commerc and have got a picket fence around
it ^her grave^ painted white and trimed with black ? I miss her company much. If you
have not received my letters there are many things that contained in them you
would like to hear our family matters &amp;c. In my Jan letter I told you about my 
temporal affairs and situation and I have just written you a letter which I
shall not send you but shall keep it for you when you come home come home 
those are pleaseing words shall I ever realize them I hope to. I am now at 
[[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father Clark?s]] where I have been since last Dec. they are verry kind to me and have been 
ever since I have been there he makes me welcome to stay here untill you come home there 
is a branch of the church here of about 50 and they are well united [[Ephraim Grant Luce|Ephraim Luce]] belongs 
to it and family N. Thoma's and family they wish to be remembered to you. Stephen 
Luce lives in Commerce - one part of it is call Nauvoo it is building up verry fast indeed 
they have appointed a stake on the west side of the river and [[Nashville, Jackson County, Iowa|Nashvill]] is the place 
appointed to build up a citty. I have seen brother [[William Benbow|William Benbow]] from Eng. where 
you made it your home for 2 months when they were there and the little girls that used
to sleep with you, or the man of God as they called you, they were as much pleased to see me as
though we had always been acquainted I had a verry pleaseing visit with them they

it when you learn that it was all written on my knee in the bed not
being able to sit up. I shall give up the remainder of this sheet to brother Smoot not
being able to fill it myself. With much love I remain yours

I liked to have met with a loss in my sickness but have not yet.

Elder W. Woodruff asteemed
friend &amp; friend brother I gladly imbrace the
oppertunity that now offers me of writing
you a few lines by way of compliment
altho writen on my knee in hast by reaso[n] [page torn]
of the press of bu[si]ness that is now waiti[ng] [page torn]
on me. I beleave that things remane much
as they was when you left. Sickness prevailes
and all buness seemes to have stoped for the present

Perhaps it may be said that the presidency
has bought upper [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] but what they give
for it I cannot say deffinetly. I would also informe
you that Govner [[Robert Lucas|Lucus]] of [[Iowa Territory|Ioway]] has sent
dow an exepress for [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]] and he is gone to see him
but what his buness is I persum is not known
It might be edefying or grattifying to you to
informe you that the fary at Commerce is
now in the hands of the bishops as I am cred
bly informed and President [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] is fast
recvering from a serious attact of sickness
you have the first interest in my prayrs?
most fervent, and I desire an interest in yours
I am sir as ever your most)
affecttionet Brother? ) A.O SmootYes I even begin to look forth for the day when I hope and trust that I
shall behold and embrace him whom I now feal to dedicate to the Lord know
ing his calling although it I think it the greatest sacrafice that I could
make to be deprived of the society and company of my nearest friend on earth
but I think that the grace of God is sufficient for all things even to raise
me from a bed of sickness and preserve me ^and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]]^ untill thy return which is
my sincere desire. Oh! Willford do not forget ^us^ when at the throne of grace
for we need as much grace to stand at this time of trial there are not
enough well people in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] to take care of the sick therefore
they suffer for want of attention?much the same in [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]]
although some have died there?and none in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] save a
number of children brother [[Parley Parker Pratt|Pratts]] was one of the number? well
when you left. There have about 53 of the brethren died in [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]]
and it continues verry sickly there yet? brother [[Johnston F. Lane|Lane]] has lost both
of his children. brother [[Warren Smith|Warren Smith]]s wife is dead some of your
Southern acquaintance?brother [[Jeremiah Byrd Murphy|Jeremiah Murphy]] has been here from
[[Tennessee|Tennessee]] and wishes to be rem^e^mbered to you. I suppose that you
have learned the fate of our [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|Island]] friends as I heared that you went
through [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]] was glad that you had an oppertunity of seeing
them. I received a book of brother [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor?s]] writing from [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]]
with your marke or my name on it. was glad even to see that
I received a letter from home the day that you left home. the^i^r heath
was generally good accept sister [[Sarah Brackett Carter Foss|Foss]] who was quite feeble and had been
for 2 months in consequence of lifting the old gentleman who lived with her
in his last illness he died last April. they sent much love to you and
the letter was d^i^rected to you. they much wished you ^to^ called and see
brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] in [[New York|N.Y.]] they feared that you would not know that he was
there. did not know that we had a paper from him. they wanted me
to come home and stay with them while you was gone. they wanted
you to call there on your return from [[England|England]]? Sister Foss would be
much pleased with a letter from you. do write me once a month for
they will seam long. I found the last page in your journal and read
it with interest. hope that you found a lock of my hair with some lines
in your trunk. Sarah sends a lock of her hair to you with a kiss by kissing
the letter. Shshe often calls pa-pa-pa- verry loud?dont you hear her. If
you have an oppertunity to get some wooling undershirts they would be much
better for you. I have been weighting to receive a a letter from you before I wrote
but feared if I weighted longer you would not get it before you left N.Y.Sept 19th 1839
Lovely-street as you named the place when here

Dear Willford

After waightining waiting 5 long weeks after you left me to
hear from you I take my pen although in a feeble state and on the bed
as you will perceive from my writing. I let [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] stay at [[Abraham Owen Smoot|brother Smoots]]
8 days after you left then she came home well and fleshy and bright she continued well
about 2 weeks and then I was taken with the fever and ague 3 or 4 days before she was.
we were then in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] and no one to do any thing for us as they were all sick
about there so that brother and [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|sister Smoot]] came out and mooved us to their
house and rendered us every assistanc they could although their house was
unfinished yet our accommodations were much better than in Montrose.
we have been quite low having had a shake every day but are both getti
ng better now. I was much rejoiced to hear of the improvement of your
health after you left by a man who saw ^you^ about 40 miles from here who said
that you requested him to call and see me. I was glad to hear from you any
way. much wonder that you do not write as you have always done before
I think that you have not time or the letter has miscaried or something has
happened. so good night my Willford hopeing that I shall feel better
in the morn. The morn has come and found me for the first time
without a chill or shake although I feal verry weak yet I think that
I am gaining health and Sarah to. The men have come to day to raise my
house I am in hopes that they will get it finished by the time that I am
able to go into it their has been some talk of sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Tailor?s]] going in with
me as she had to move out of brother [[Brigham Young|Youngs]] house she went into my room
with sister [[Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt|Pratt]] while I am out here. Sister Taylor wants to come
out into this neighbourhood she is a good neighbour. but the family you
left with me Oh! dear! if I had expected the time had been long that I 
should have dwealt there I should have sent for you to have come home
for I could not have staid in the house with any contentment? but
thank the Lord I have not for the frirst moment wished you at home
since you left but desired and prayed for your spead and success on
your mission, Yea that you might have strength both temporal and spi
ritual wisdom grace knowledge humility and understanding to pres
erve you from all evil and help you fill your mission in the love
and fear of God and have many souls as seals of your ministry

I hope to do better next time  [[Jonathan Harriman Holmes|Homes]] has lost his [[Marietta Carter Holmes|wife]], and [[Mary Emma Holmes|babe]] about 3 months old, O The church have 
bought a steamboat and have got it running on the river? they gave 4000 
dolls. for it. Brother [[William Van Ausdall|Vanosdel]] has been appointed chief magistrate this season 
Brother [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdons]] health is verry poor. I am weighting for you to come home before 
[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emmas]] funeral sermon is preached or [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willford O.]] is blest. Please Tell Brother G. A. 
Smith that his [[Clarissa Lyman Smith|mother]] and [[Caroline Clara Smith Callister|sister]] have been sick but are now quite smart like
wise his [[John Smith, b. 1781|father]] and [[John Lyman Smith|brother]]. Brother [[Pierce Hawley|Hawley]] sends his respects to you likewise 
Brother [[Albert Smith|A. Smith]]. [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Brother Joseph]] has received a letter from you and brother 
G. A. Smith. May the Lord Bless preserve and keep you from all harm is

bu Dont deprive yourself of the comforts of life for any of these things for I had rather 
do without them? I have not got the paper you spoke of now any one

&amp; W.O. Woodruff

Answered London Jan 13th 1841all be restored again.? Paul says I die da^i^ly [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|brother Joseph]] says that he actually 
died and was raised to life again? says the beasts that he fought with at Epesus often 
killed him and he came to life again? if so Willford why may not our little 
[[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] be raised to life again? He, brother Joseph has brought forth many new 
things this season.? There has been quite a number of deaths in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] 
the past season I believed that I mentioned some of them in my last 
letter to you [[Seymour Brunson|Seymour Brunson]], he was buried under armes? bishop he said that 
brother [[David Wyman Patten|D. Patten]] was calling him and desired brother Joseph to let him go for 
he needed him? likewise bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] is dead and his wife is married again to 
[[William Huntington, b. 1784|father Huntingdon]] who lost his wife last fall ? [[Sarah Burt Beman|Mother Beanam]]? father John Jo 
[[Joseph Smith, Sr.|Joseph Smith]] the patriarch a little previous to his death he called his children around 
him and blessed them and appointed [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]] Patriarch in his stead? There are 
many things I have mentioned in my other letters to you which would be 
interesting to you which I could mention if you have not received them. 
such as some of the brethren?s going among the Indians, I saw two of them 
on the 2nd of this month and they said the prospects were good - last April 
there was an Indian his wife and daughter baptized in Commerce.? I have 
not heard from [[Maine|Main]] or [[Connecticut|Connecticut]] since I wrote you last. - Did you 
know that [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|brother Ilus]] in [[New York|N. Y.]] was married? Brother [[Dwight Webster|Dwite Webster]] 
came here in june and went to the south with [[Abraham Owen Smoot|brother Smoot]] &amp; 
expects to spend the winter in [[Tennessee|Ten.]] brother Smoot has ordained him an 
elder and given him charge over the churches there, he makes great pro
ficiency in the ministry? brother Smoot has got home and with his wife sends 
his respects to you [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Sister Smoot]] says to tell brother Woodruff not to forget my hymn book 
and while you are thinking of hers remember that I have no hymn book or bible.

Brother [[John Herrett|John Herrett]] has been walking in your steps even on the [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|fox islands]] 
with some other elders and there has been quite a stir among the people there again 
and there has about as many come into the church lately us when you was 
there? sister [[Jane Herrett|Jane Herrett]] say give my respects to br Woodruff I have lately had 
a letter from her? I have lately seen sister [[Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley|Bently]] she that ^was^ sister Pattin she says 
give my love to brother Woodruff and tell him he knows that I love him with 
all my hart, her health is poor and she desires the prayrs of all that quorum 
that it may not turn with her as it did with brother [[Parley Parker Pratt|Pratts]] first wife in her 
last day but that she may be spared through it and do good on the earth
she wants that little portrait of brother Pattins which you have as she has n[one]

I [page torn] you to get your portrait painted if you can conveniently? a[page torn]
if you [page torn] [ca]n get me a wrought black lace veil I should like it much and [page torn]
cape and collar I should be much pleased as they come much cheaper the[page torn] 
here. The families of the 12 have rather snug times to get along here? brother 
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball]] was a wise man to build his house and get his family into it before he 
left them. I have seen [[Sister Moon|sister Moon]] [[Sister Sutton|sister Sutton]] and another sister from [[England|Eng]] I 
have forgotten her name they were from [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]] they have seen you all. 
I was glad to see them. I read some of your letters to them they were 
much pleased with them. Please give my respects to brother Kimbal and 
all the quorum that are there likewise all the saints around you.

19th Yesterday Sunday, we had an interesting sermon we had an interesting
subjec upon the living's being baptized for the dead it was made so plain that none 
could dispute it reasonably and I should be glad to be baptized for my grandparents 
and some others but want to wait for you to do it would it not be best, I had ra
ther you would do it than any person living.? Sister [[Hannah Mercey Currier Swasey|Swasey]] one of my good 
neighbours sends her respects to you and says tell brother Woodruff that she wants 
him to come home for my sake. I am now at [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father Clark]]s and think I shall 
stay here untill you come home. I am comfortable here and if I want any thing 
can call on brother [[William Oglesby Clark|William Clark]] who wrote to you in my other letter makeing 
a covenant with you that he would supply my needs and wants untill you 
come home, He is a fine young man? belongs to the 70s and is father Clarks oldest 
son at home he know you and says he is some acquainted with you? therefore 
give yourselfe no uneasiness about my temporal wants but give me and our 
[[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|babe]] an interest in your prayrs. I fell anxious to see my presents you spoke of 
in your last letter? Ah! what shall I do when those little shoes come for Sarah 
I don?t know sometimes how to bear her loss it seames as though I cannot endure 
it, but I must stop for it seems line a neverending subject for me to speak or 
write on. Sister [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] and [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] received some very pretty presents I saw 
them when I was there they (like me) thought much of them; more on account 
of their comeing from their husbands ? If you could get some articles of clothing for 
your family it would be quite acceptable? the sister who gave you the bed in N. Y.
apostatized in about 2 weeks after so [[Sister Stone|sister Stone]] told me from N. Y. Sarah 
Milliken is not married yet but expects to be to a man out of the Church she 
is in Commerce.? [[Aphia S. Woodman|Aphia Woodman]] has sent a letter to Sarah Milliken asking 
her advice and mine about coming west with [[Milton Holmes|Milton]] she is about 60 miles east of 
[[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father Carter]]s with her brother - Milton has lately sent here to know who of the 
brethren are going to Eng. this fall and when they will be in N.Y. so it appears that 
he is thinking of going but there are none who are thinking of going from here this 
fall, I hear that brother Joseph dont think it is best for them to go. Brother [[Jonathan Harriman Holmes|Johnathan]]
came from a distance, we had a address from our prophet after which it was 
voted that [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] should be built up and three ^one^ man was appointed to preside 
over it I think they ^it^ was brother [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Almon Babbit]] [[Oliver Granger|father Granger]] &amp; brother [[Elias Higbee|Higby]] 
?then it was motioned that a committee be appointed and commissioned to 
appoint &amp; lay up stakes for the gathering ^from [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] to Kirtland.^? [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram Smith]] [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Whight]] 
and Judge Higby were chosen? then they proposed building the Lord's 
house by tytheing the people they commen^ce^ to collect materials this fall and begin to 
build next spring? the people meet togather and work every tenth day 
br. [[Reynolds Cahoon|R. Cayhoon]] H. Smith &amp; one more were appointed for the committee ? the house 
is to 100 feet by 120 and much other business was done the meeting closed 
by an address from [[John Cook Bennett|Dr. Bennet]] (a quarter master general who has lately been 
baptized) upon the subject of war. And by his talk you wo^u^ld conclude they
that the brethren expected war with [[Missouri|Missourie]] sometime ? he is a great orator.

4 th Sun. meeting commenced to day at 9 oclock and it was judged that 
there was 5000 people on the ground. I shall not particularize the business of 
this day or the morrow for my [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|babe]] was quite troublesom which took my at
tention much, 5th. [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|brother Joseph]] was expected to preach today on the Priest
hood but his health would not admit of it so A. Babbit took the stand and 
delivered an interesting discourse upon the same subject.? yesterday brother Joseph spoke 
a short time from 29 verse of the 15 chap. of first Cor. of which I will here after speak
&amp; this afternoon brother L. White spoke on the same subject which was very interes
ting. To-day we hear that brother [[Theodore Turley|Turly]] and his company are within 2 or three days 
journey of here, and I stopped a week, to see them expecting to hear from you by then 
spent most of the time with sister [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] she sends her respects to you?  She and
family are well likewise sister [[Mary Ann Frost Pratt|Pratt]] &amp; child I went to see sister [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] She was not verry 
well but was getting better, [[Elizabeth Young, b. 1825|Elizabeth]], and [[Vilate Young, b. 1830|Vilate]] have been sick but are better? sister 
[[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] &amp; family are comfortably well? likewise sister [[Polly Keeler Clark|Clark]] &amp; [[Frances Amelia Kimberley Turley|Turleys]] family's also 
[[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|sister Woodruff]] is comfortably as to health but her babe is not well. It has got now to be 
the 15th of the month and brother Turley has not yet arrived here ? I see my subjects and 
sentences are verry broken but if you knew how I have to write you would not think 
it strange, for I often have to leave my pen every minute and take the babe ^and^ but have to 
write with him in my lap so that I make but poor headway about this business,? 
although my sentences are more broken &amp; disconnected than they otherwise would 
by reason of my little son, I do not consider it any task to take care of him and 
presume you will excuse me for these reasons and to ask the Lord to spare him for 
future usefulness and for a comfort to his parents.? I feel that without my babe I 
should be miserable indeed ? yes much more lonely than at now - you cannot think how
much I miss little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] her death has disarmed me of all courage faith &amp; 
fortitude, I have had almost one scene of trouble since you left me by sickness &amp;c but 
I ^feel^ as though they were all light afflictions when compared with that ? O pray for 
me Willford that I may have grace and strength equal to my day - for I feel like a 
lonely child on the earth now but I endure it as for Christ sake knowing that nothing 
but a sense of duty to our heavenly ^father^ would cause us to part with the enjoyment of each of 
each others society; but I will try to be patient and take as good care of our little lad as
I can untill you return, which I pray God may be soon, for it seames that you 
have been gone an age,?  Only ^think^ most 15 months, do tell me something about when 
you think of comeing HOME - Well I have wandered far from my subject the 
conference, it hend 3 days and closed on the 5th (Monday) and I returned home after 
spending a week in Commerce - We had a verry interesting conference and often did I 
wish that Yo you and your quorum could have the privilege of being there. 16th today
I hear that the brethren have commenced to draw stone for the meetinghouse. Now a few 
words from Brother Joseph sermon on the living?s being baptized for the dead that they 
may be judged according to men in the flesh; he has learned by revelation that those in 
this church may be baptized for any of their relatives who are dead and had not a 
privalege privaledge of hearing it this gospel even for their children, parents, bothers, sisters, 
grandparents, uncles, &amp; aunts,? but not for acquaintances unless they send a mi
nistering spirit to their friends on earth,? as soon as they are baptized for their 
friends they are released from prison and they can claim them in the resurrection
and bring them into the celestial kingdom? this doctrin is cord^i^ally received by the church 
and they are going forward in multitudes, some are going to be baptized as many as 
16 times? they have to be baptized and confirmed separately for every friend? once 
in one day? How many can a spirit be baptized wh? why not deputize a friend on earth 
to do it for them? [[John Wesley Clark|John Wesly]] can receive this work but how can his spirit be 
baptize in water? It is the privilege of the oldest one in a family to be baptized 
for their friends if they desire it but they can give it to another if they choose 
Brother Joseph makes this doctrin look verry plain and consisten? he 
has been bringing strange things forward to the church this season? strong 
meat? he has delivered a course of lectures this season which were verry 
interesting? I could not attend only apart of the time but often wished you 
could be present?  he says that the throne of God stands on the earth like this earth 
only it is cleansed &amp;c &amp;c? says that this earth is the wickedest planate that ever God made 
and that its inhabitants are will have the greatest glory if they overcome evil? and 
that it was the largest when made but at different times there has been parts 
taken from it, for instance when the ten tribes were lost and says they will[[Lee County, Iowa Territory|Lee County]] Iowa Territory, Sept. 6th ^Oct 6th^ 1840

My Dear Companion

To day I came down to the Hawly settle
ment and there I received a letter from you which I had long looked for, it
afforded the pleaseing of your health inteligence of your health and prosperity in 
the gospel and many kind words to the children? the former I was much pleased
to hear but the latter even those to [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] were like daggers to my heart think
ing She was torn from my embrace and laid in the silent grave when she could not 
receive a kiss for her pa, or a fathers blessing but just previous to the departure
of her spirit from her body, she left a kiss with me for her pa, pa, whome ^she^ called many times 
in day? the little dear was not permitted to see you after you left her in her little
carriage at brother [[Pierce Hawley|hawly]]?s door. I often think of her traveling from [[Maine|Maine]] with
us though that toilsome journey and of her suffering with me in my cold house in
Lovely street when we were both sick, and suffered much for want of wood &amp;
fire I could not sit up all day and was verry feeble and alone she was sick &amp; 
had to crawl about on the cold floor alone these things grieve me, but she has gone, 
her deposition was to lovely to long remaine long on the earth her spirit to pure to mingle 
with the spirits of the earth a more affectionate kind and lovely disposition never 
inhabited a human brest than she possessed &amp; I was anxious for the time to come that 
I could teach her the things of the kingdom of God.

Ah! Sarah?s gone?Dear Babe?Her journey?s ore! 
She breathe'd? she wept.? but she shall weep no more. 
How short her time by providence assigned! 
About 2 years she was on earth confine'd! 
Angelic bands her spirit did convey, 
To happier realmes in everlasting day:
Our lovely child has first arrived at home, 
to see the splendor of the eternal throne. 
And shout us welcome to the promised land. 
Our Sarah?Lovely Babe?Her infant frame, 
No more shall feel the smart of mortal pain,
She only sleeps! Though motionless she lies.
Her sacred dust, refined, again shall rise, 
to shine in bliss most exquisitly bright, 
Surpassing far the sun?s refulgent light. 
And is she dead? O no! She entered life 
the moment she escaped this world of strife:
She?s now from earth removed, her soul expands, 
And by the throne in holy rapture stands; 
Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streames, 
And basks unsully' delighted, in unsully?d beames;
Now hears with wonder the melodious strain, 
And joins to celebrate Mesiah?s name; 
Her mind illumined now with glad surprise, 
Sees happier worlds, unseen from mortal eyes. 
She now perhaps ^from^ Zion?s hight sublime 
Looks down and views the simple things of time; 
Or, if permited, to the earth descends, 
And gladly mingles with her earthly friends; 
Although unsee her happy spirit near,
May hear the sigh, and see the falling tear, 
May with concern behold maternal grief, 
And fondly wish to sooth and give relief.

On the 15th I received another letter 
dated july 8th, which also bore
pleasing inteligence of your 
health and prosperity and 
also of the brethren with you. 
The friends flock around to hear 
your letters and seam much inter
ested in them. I send them to 
[[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]] to read as he wants to 
see them. Perhapse you may 
think that I have forgotten to 
tell you anything about our little 
[[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willford Owen]], O no, for he is now 
in my lap pulling &amp; scratching 
round so that I can hardly write. 
he has just ^torn^ up the almenack before 
I saw what he was doing, he grows 
finely considering the sickness he has 
had, has been sick much of the time 
since he was born, he has the chills &amp; 
fever now. He is now reaching 
and trying to get my pen I will 
give it him and see what he 
will write. [In Wilford Jr.?s handwriting] Dear pa pa do come 
home and see me I want to see you 
Dear wants to see you to, she often 
cries about it. W. O. Woodruff. 
Thus he has written some to his 
pa pa himself they say the it is 
said that fools and children tell 
the truth? Enough of this.? 
I have thought of not writing to you 
any more for two reasons one is 
I fear that you will not get them 
and another is I heard that our letters 
were oppened before you get them by a set of men, but I trust your good sense will 
cause you not to have my weak letters exposed for they are designed for no eye but yours. 
I have received all the letters you mentioned haveing written and they have affor
ded me much satisfaction, &amp; sometimes I get quite lonely and disconsolat then the reception of 
a letter cheers me up and I live hopeing that the time will come that you may be retu
rned home once more, this is the 8th letter I have sent you since you have been in 
[[England|Eng.]] and paid the postage on them to [[New York|N.Y.]] I regret verry much that you do not get
more of them. My health is comfortably good? I was verry glad yours was so 
good. We hear that brother [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratt]] has taken his family to Eng. But brother Joseph does 
not approve of it I hear.  When I commenced this letter I thought I would keep 
a little kind of a journal untill after the conference on the 2nd of Oct. I attended the con
ference though from the beginning I will give you some items of it as my mem
ory serves me and in my next letter will coppy the minutes as you do not get the papers 
should have done so now but Brother [[Robert Blashel Thompson|R Thompson]] had not got them made out 
yet? The [illegible] conference commence was appointed the 2[nd] of Oct but in consequence 
of bad weather they did not meet 3rd to-day there was a large assembly many brethren[stamp in red ink] 6 Ev 6

lace wrought veil and a wrought lace cape and collar 
I should be much pleased as they are much cheaper there 
than here but if not convenient let it go. I really 
hope you will get my letters for I took the utmost 
pains to write to you I am comfortable here now 
br. [[William Oglesby Clark|William Clark]] that wrote in one of my letters to 
you says if want any thing to call on him which 
I shall do but believe me when I say that the families 
of those in Eng. mostly need them at home I th [damage]

it should cause uneasiness. I would tell you some 
more things but I fear that some one will see it.

I know you do

The church is prospering well here 
never better? they have bought 
a steam boat and gave 4000 
dolls. for it and it is running 
on the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]] 
scribbling indeed 
cant stop to read
what I have writtenNov. 1st. today we have had a good meetting at father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clarks]] where I live? there 
is a branch of the church here of about 50 members my name with [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] 
&amp; [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willford?s]] are enroled in this branch? brother [[William Oglesby Clark|Wm. Clark]] is the president of this 
branch has gone to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] or [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] today and says that I must preside over the 
meeting today? there are a number of elders here and I would like to have some 
of them take your place a while and let you be at home with me and Willford 
Owen, O poor little is gone Sarah is gone how can I bear it? hard hard indeed, O
tell me Willford why she was taken from me when you was gone it seames some 
times that I can hardly help murmering at it? she was the was the pride and 
joy of my heart in my lonely moment and her sweet disposition rendered her lovely 
to all around her? Willford Owen is not near as pretty as she was ? just befor she 
died she left a kiss with me for her pa, pa. I had like to have forgotten to tell you that 
on the 29th I received a letter from sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice Woodruff]] they were well then and men
tioned haveing received a communication from you dated july 10 they have received 
3 letters from you? they have lately had news of uncle [[Joseph Hart, b. 1787|Joseph Harts]] death of [[Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts|Springfield]] 
he died about the middle of Sept. I think with the billious fever? as Eunice said her 
[[Azubah Hart Woodruff|mother]] was writing to you I suppose she will give you the particulars of his death 
Eunice is not diffident about her connexion with br. [[Dwight Webster|Webster]] she writes verry plain 
to me on the subject? says she feels as though she was writing to a sister. 
She says uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem]] will probably move west in the course of a year or two? she 
appears strong in the faith.

2nd I have just this minute heard of an opportunity of sending 
to you safely I therefore leave my breakfast partly eaten and 
commence to write a little more in my letter thinking that 
apart of a sheet will be better than none ^to you^ if your feelings are 
like mine in regard to hearing from you? my health and 
Willford Owen?s is good this morn. I dont know as you like 
the addition of Owen to his name but sister [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Smoot]] much desired 
it. I told you in my last letter which I mailed about 
ten days since that I would send you the minutes of the 
conference in it but as I have not got them and suppose that 
brother [[Robert Blashel Thompson|Thompson]] will send them I defer it. I have not 
received the papers from you should be much pleased to? 
We have just received the Sept. paper it contains the most 
of one of your letters and little Sarah death in it and I hope you 
will get it by the bearer of this. I have received all the letters 
from you that you spoke of and this is the 9th one that I have 
sent you since you have been in [[England|Eng]]. I long want much 
to hear from you again hopeing you will tell me something 
about comeing home. I expect to hear by br. [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] as you 
mentioned writing by him and I want to see those articles 
much because they come from you. Brother [[John Edward Page|Page]] &amp; [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] 
left here last April on a mission, to the Jews they were exp
ecting to go first to the jews in [[New York|N. Y.]] then to those in Eng 
from thence to Constantinople ? they are preaching 
by the way to get means to carry them though they 
dont think of leaveing America with 1000 dolls. each 
we have not heard as they have got to NY yet I expect[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] Lee County Iowa Terr. Oct. 25th 1840

My Dearest Willford
I have just sent a full sheet to 
the office for you and think I will begin another now and 
keep a kind of a journal or sketch of times and things with me 
untill I hear from you again. Today we have had a good meet
ing at father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clark?s]] where I live and just as meeting closed 
brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]] rode up to the door this is the first time. I have 
seen him since his return from his mission? he has been 
gone about 4 months and been into the states of [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] [[Alabama|Alabama]]
&amp;c. and has baptized in company with br. [[Dwight Webster|D. Webster]] about 26 and or
dained him an elder and given him charge over the church in 
Ten. about 200 miles from where you traveled? br Smoot took 
supper with me and I think you would have been a welcome guest 
at the table he says that br. Webster has got to be a workman and 
thinks of returning to [[Connecticut|Con.]] in march and settleing up his busines 
and comeing west as soon as he can. 26th today I feel lonely but 
comfort myselfe with thinking that W. will come home and sure 
ly he will not get away so again without I go to? you speak 
about [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willford?s]] growing fast so as to go into the vinyard, I think 
he will be large enough by the next time you want to go so you 
can take him along at least I want you to. 27th today I have 
had a tried day my babe has been verry sick he still has the chills 
and fever verry hard and today I got quite alarmed about him
his fever ran so high but at night he is better I have broke his fever 
4 times with Sappington?s pills but it will return. 28th today 
I have felt quite comfortable my babe has been considerable smart.
I thought I would write you a little every night just before I 
retired to rest and let you know a little of the occurrences of the 
day with me. 29th today I am makeing a vest for brother [[Abraham Washburn|Washburn]] 
toward paying for a pair of shoes as I am much in want of them I 
feel badly thried in mind, W. says I should like to know what it is 
about well I will tell you when you come home, 30 today I feell some 
better and finish my vest as I make slow progress in tayloring with 
my babe and other chores 31st I feel quite well in mind today after 
committing my case to my heavenly father he has taken it into his hands and 
will do wright about it, I am makeing a cap for [[Ezra Thompson Clark|Ezra Clark]], Willford continues 
better Please direct your letters to [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] as it will be more convenient for me to get them.
Brother [[Dwight Webster|Webster]] s^t^arts on his mission monday morn.			          Good night Willford
(May 25 I have just heard that [[New Orleans, Louisiana|N. Orleans]] was covered 10 ft. deep with water and
it was still rising and that [[Natchez, Adams County, Mississippi|Nathces]] was entirely destroyed by a a whirlwind)

May 9th 25th 1840

July 14th 1840
Answered        out the church. Lest you may not get my letters I would just say that brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]]
is married and sister [[Shuah Coffin Carter Moulton|Shuah]] expects to be soon. sister [[Rhoda Farnham Carter Scammans|Rhoda Scammans]] has a young
[[Sarah Carter Scammans|daughter]] 13 days older than my [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|babe]]. brother [[Luther Scammans|Luther]] wants to come to the west but sister R
does not. Did you know of the correspondence between brother [[Dwight Webster|Webster]] and sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] I
knew nothing of it untill he came here [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother Woodruff]] hinted someting of the kind in
her letter and Eunice sent me word to receive him as a particular friend of her's. and
then brother Webster told me of it himselfe he expects to take on himselfe the yoke of matrim
ony with sister Eunice a soon after his return from this mission. I think that he
will make an agreeable companion. he is a pleasant man and has an enquiring mind and
seames to gain much faith and strength by converseing and becomeing acquainted with
the brethren I think after he gets some more experience he will make a verry useful man.
[[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]] has not yet retirned from [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]]. suppose he is on his way. has been verry sick
on the way. The brethren are about trying to redeem [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] those who hold claim on
it will take land in [[Canada, British North America|canada]] and the church here will give them land here for their
possessions in canada I have lately heard that one brother [[Lyman Stoddard|Stodard]] formerly from there
was going back to see them about it. I often think that I should like to be with you a 
while and see how are getting along. If you could look over here in a rolling prairie near the
timber into a little small house with one door in it you might see me verry often
[paper torn]ing my little [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|boy]] in my armes and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] clinging on to the rocker of my chair so that
[paper torn]may rock a little with us singing pa-pa  ma-ma and bilo [paper torn]boy or Willo as
she calls him.? I find my little ones are much company fo[paper torn] I had almost
forgotten to tell you that we heard that the Indan?s had been into two counties in
[[Missouri|Missourie]] and made them pay them taxes on the land. it is said that the Misso
urians fear the Indians much. Mr. [[Samuel Bogart|Bogart]] the capt. of the Missourie mob shot
[[Alexander Beattie|a man]] their election day and he lived but a few hours. has had his trial and is to be
hung the 4th of next july. thus I suppose his career will be ended for this life.

Many of the brother are fearful of the Indian?s comeing on [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] side of the
river and killing them but I feal verry easey about it myselfe although I have no
Willford to look out for me. I believe my trust is in the Lord and I think that he
will protect me. 24th Saturday eve. our family are in comfortable health and tomorrow
I expect to go to [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] to hear [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|brother Joseph]] preach on the resurrection
[[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Sister Taylor]] has recently received a letter from [[John Taylor, b. 1808|brother Taylor]] wherein he says that you
baptize 32 persons one week and 13 of them were methodist preachers. glad to hear of
your success. Just heard that there was a letter in the office for me. hope it is so. write
often. dreamed last night of seeing and asking you when you was comeing home thought
you said, you did not know. hope you will tell me in your next when you think of come
ing home. Please give my respects to all the brother there with whome I am acquainted and all
those who love our Lord Jesus Christ. must give way for brother Webster. May grace mercy and
peace rest upon you forever in is the prayr of your companion
Willford Woodruff. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|P.W. Woodruff]]

[Brother Webster?s writing]
Dear Brother in the Lord
Mrs Woodruff has presented me this sheet with the
privilege of communicating a few lines therein to you, which I thankfully embrace. by this
you will conclude that I am at the west, which is the case. I left [[Connecticut|Con]] the 19 of April
and after a journey of 21 dayays I arived at Montrose from thence to this place. I
expect to remain here with the Church a short time, &amp; than take a Mission to the east. I
am glad to find the Church in a prosperous situation which I think is the case. the news the
particulars I suppoase your Wife will communicate to you. there are many convinceing proofs
o that Israel will soon return and Zion be redeemed. I still remain a believer in the worck
although not exempt from temptation. yet throug faith in Christ I expect to conquer and gain
a Crown of life may the worck of God roal forward untill the kingdom and the greatness therof shall
be given to the Saints. pray for me. may the Love of God be with you. With the respects
of Dwight Webster, Your Brother in the Lord.I do not know as you can find out this letter for I have to write it mostly with [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|my babe]]
in my armes and little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah]] around me ? she calls aloud for pa-pa many times in a day
but the poor child has no pa to hear her. she is quite lonely like myselfe can you not tell me some
thing near when you shall y come home I shall look for you in the fall. I have written you
three letters before this since you left this continent and d^i^rected them to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston, Lankinshire, Eng.]]
and received 2 from you one dated Jan. 12th the other 27th - I should have written you oftener but
my circumstances would not admit of it ? it was not for the want of fealing or anx
iety about you for believe me the society of no friends can fill the place of Willford in my heart
for I feal verry lonely of times Yes the briny flood will oft times overflow its banks in spite
of all my endeavours to restrain it but I know that it is the will of God that my compan
ion should labour in the vineyard of the Lord therefore I have tried to be reconciled to the will
of God in all things ? I have not been left to murmer or complain once since you left me
but am looking forward to the day when you shall return home once more haveing filled
your mission in the love and fear of God. You are always present with me when I go
before the throne of grace and when I am asking for protection and blessings for myselfe and little
ones I claim a large one for my dear Willford who has gone far far from me even to a foreign
nation where he is exposed to all the scoffs of those who realize not the inportance importance of the things
of God and the dangers attached there unto? O may the spirit of humility wisdom grace peace and
truth ever rest upon you is the prayr of your [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe]] who much desires to see you but cannot
at present. Sarah Emma and little Willford Jun Jr. wrote to you in the letter I sent you by brot
her [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] I hope you will obtain the letters I have sent you for I mentioned many things
in them relative to my situation. I am now at father [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clark?s]] whome I mentioned in my other
letter am living by myselfe and think of staying here untill fall they are verry kind to me.
I have a girl with me that works for me a part of the time and for herselfe some ? [paper damaged]
got along quite comfortable since I came to father Clarks for help food and raime[nt] [paper damaged]
requested me to tell you particulars I would say that my cow has not yet come in [paper damaged]
the calfe you left with me I kept it (although they were not much pleased with it in brother
[[Pierce Hawley|Hawly]]?s [[Hawley&apos;s Grove, Lee County, Iowa|neighbourhood]]) because you desired me to before you left I have 2 hens and 12 chickens
they compose my stock at present. I hear that brother [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]] is expecting to have some houses built
in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] for the families of the 12 Commerce is building up surprizeingly ? the emigration
there is said to be much greater than it ever was in [[Caldwell County, Missouri|Caldwell County]], and the work is rolling
on in America with much rapidity ? am glad to hear of its progress in [[England|England]] ? pitty the
poor people in Eng. ? I hope the saints will be patient and weight untill the Lord delivers them
which he will do in his own time and way. I suppose that you get the [[Times &amp; Seasons|times and seasons]] as the Editors
said they sent each of the 12 a paper and by them you will learn of our brethrens success at Congress
and many other things perhapse more correctly than I could inform you. Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] has
lately lost [[Harriet Pamela Partridge|a daughter]] 18 years of age. ? brothter [[Jeremiah Byrd Murphy|Murphy]] of [[Tennessee|Tennesse]] whome you used to be acquainted
there came to lovely street stoped a while then returned to his family and lived but 4 days
afterwards. Sister [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|Taylor]] [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] &amp;[[Parley Parker Pratt|P Pratts]] familie?s are well. ? Sister [[Vilate Murray Kimball|Kimbal]] is troubled some
with the ague and I have it every little while. We have lately heard that there has been a battle
fought in [[Maine|Maine]] between the British and Americans about the boundary line and the Governors son
was killed how it will end I know not ? the British requested the Americans to give up the
disputed land forth with but they refuse to do it therefore they are fulfilling the prophecies ancient
and modern. We have heard of no accident happening to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|N. Orleans]] ? there has been much
destruction of the shipping in this country the past winter and spring ? think it must have surp
rized the people much to have seen that light and the earth rise as you mentioned in
your letter. [[Ephraim Grant Luce|Ephraim Luce]] and [[Stephen Grant Luce|Stephen]] have a standing with the 70 seventies ? brother Stephen
is expecting to go out on a mission this season ? his [[Malatiah Luce|father]] and [[Ruth Luce|mother]] is expected here this sea
son ? she that was [[Melana Ames|Melana Ames]] and [[Mary Ames|Mary Ames]] have come back to the church. [[Justus Ames|Brother]]
and [[Betsey Hudson Ames|sister Ames]] have sent for me to come and stay with them untill you return they
live about 60 miles from Commerce ? [[Rufus Ames|Rufus]] has been baptised their son ? and [[Valentine Ames|Volentine]] has as
much as he can do to get along with his family ? lives on the [[South Fox Island, Knox County, Maine|south Island]]. Mr Mulliner is very
believing yet in this work and it is thought that he will be baptized ? brother [[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] talks of going
on to [[Fox Islands, Knox County, Maine|the Islands]] this season ? I expect that [[Sarah Milliken|Sarah Milliken]] will marry a man[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] [[Lee County, Iowa Territory|Lee County]] May 9th 1840

My Dear Willford

Think me not negligent in answering your letter when I tell you
you that it about 3 weeks since I received your last communication which I was truly glad
to get and perused it with much satisfaction? the most of my time since your letter came to hand
has been devoted to the care of [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|my babe]] for the destroyer has tried hard to get him from me but I feell
as though I had the best right to him and I claimed him at the hand of God and he was pleased to
spare him unto me which I consider to be another token that he has not forgotten me? may
I ever be thankful for his mercies to me? he was taken with the hooping cough and then the croup
(which is prestness for breath) set in which brought him to the gates of death ? O! thought I how
can I give up my babe even in in the absence of his father who had never seen him I felt as thou
gh I could not endure it so I and one of the sisters that lives near me took hold on faith with
all the powers of mind that we could muster and the Lord heard and answered us? she s^t^aid with
me and was a greate comfort to me?  you do not know her she has lately moved into the neigh
bourhood? so he is as well as can be expected with the hooping cough? he had the croup which is generally
mortal with children? [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] has been verry well this winter but some unwell of late but
is getting better? My health would be quite good if I did not have to be broken of my rest with my babe
so much as at the present but hope that he will soon be better of his cough

[Lydia Luce?s handwriting]
Dear Brother, Through the blessing of kind heaven I am permited the privilege of siting
at Sister [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe's]] table to write a few lines to you to let you know that we have
not forgotten you, my family is in good health and spirits and we hope soon to be
^setled^ in this vicinity, where we may have the privileg of visiting your family occasealy

with much rapidity Br. Joseph said that [[Benjamin Winchester|B. Winchester]] had about as [much] [page torn]
as he could do daily to baptize in [[Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] likewise in the south [page torn]
[[George Washington Brandon|Washington Brandon]] that ^you^ formerly knew in [[Tennessee|Tennesse]] is preaching and [page torn]
living there and the work spreads faster than ever in that place? one brother
[[Isaiah Benton|Benton]] has denied the faith there. It is thought that the church is in the most
prosperous state now that it ever was since its rise.

You speak of our sacrifices I am verry sensible of them but consider my
last one greater than any or all of the rest the i.e. parting with my dear compa
nion so long and to go so far from me ? believe me there is nothing but the spi
rit of God could reconcile me to it, and knowing that he is called by ^him^ God
to fill a mission and cry repentance to this generation I will try by the help
of God to be reconciled to the ^his^ will of God looking forward to the time of your
return home to the bosom of your family and the time that I trust we shall
be permited to stand on mount Zion with our little family nomore to be sep
arated, Yes my dear Willford I think our separation and trials will then be over,
let us then try to be faithful in keeping the commands of God. I believe that I hav
an interest in your prayers, never do I go before the throne of grace to as^k^ for blessings
for unworthy me but wahat what I remember my companion who has gone far
from me yes I remember you by day and by night even in the silent watches of the night
I now lay aside my letter for a few days untill a certain time shall arrive that I am looking for
daily? dread it much? wish you could be with me. March 22 that day has arrived &amp; I was? 
presented with a little [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Wilford]] waying Eight po? &amp; aquarter whome I trust I shall be able
to keep with me (at least for a while) I am as comfortible as I can exspect
[[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|P. W. Woodruff]]I often wish that you could have her a little while perhapse one night or so and
then I could have her back again? she is a verry affectionate child. I am now at
[[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Father Clark]]s where I have been about 12 weeks he has no wife she died just
before they were driven from [[Missouri|Missourie]]? he has made me welcome to stay here
untill you return; would it not be for the best think you,? they are a verry kind
family he says he wants me to feal as much at home as at my fathers house
sister [[Lurena Church Clark|Church]] that he hires to keep his house sends her respects to you and says
that she will take as good care of me as she can, she is a fine girl I think much
of her? Old father [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] lives in our house in brother [[Pierce Hawley|Hawley]]?s [[Hawley&apos;s Grove, Lee County, Iowa|settlement]]
he (brother Hawley) moved his family to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Qunicy]] last fall but is expected back this
spring; he was appointed the bishops assistant, likewise brother [[Daniel Avery|Avery]] and brother
[[Thomas Harvey Owen|Owen]] in the same neighbourhood? but I should be verry sorry to be dependent on
them for my support for they talked of makeing me sell my clothes and things
to support myselfe ^when there^, but thank the Lord I am at present out of their hands; I 
hear of no such thing now. I have been liveing by the wayside as it were ever since
you let me, I hope that you never will take another man?s say so in regard
to such things again but I do not blame you in the least for these things but
impute it to men?s not keeping their word; My dear Willford can you not tell me
something near when you will be at home, for the time seames verry long
to me. I have not heared from [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|father Woodruff]]?s family since you left
[[New York|N.Y.]] [illegible] ^shall^ you write to them or must I give them the news from you. I rece
ived a paper from sister [[Shuah Coffin Carter Moulton|Shuah]] a few days since she said they ^were^ well but [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|Mother]]
failed quite fast? she has been to N.Y. to visit brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] she waited 2 weeks
to see you there but was much disappointed in not seeing you? Brother
Joseph returned from [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] a few days since the present prospect is
that our brethren will get a redress of their wrongs? they have now 2 mill
ions of dolls. of damage now before the house and a committee is now appoi
nted to go round among the brethren and get their affidavits and bills of
damage (that is those who have not given in their bills) and it is said that
they will amount to 1 million more? the majority of the house is in our
favour? [[Henry Clay|Henry Clay]] and other influential men are warm advocates
for the church? Judge [[Elias Higbee|Higby]] [[Sidney Rigdon|S. Rigdon]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. Pratt]] and [[Benjamin Winchester|B. Winchester]] are
in Washington now? When our brethren first went to Congress they
told them they could do nothing for them, but the prospect is quite different
at now ^present^.? I expect that brother [[Orson Hyde|O. Hyde]] is on his way to [[England|England]] as I heard
that he was expecting to start today? I should have written by him had I
known it in time? the first of Jan. brother [[Brigham Young|Young]] and Smith were on
their way to [[New York City, New York County, New York|N.Y. citty]] and expected to cross the water when the Lord should

I have received 6 dolls. from you five in one letter &amp; one in another which was verry acceptable but
feared that you would need it more than I did as the people are so poor in England[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] [[Lee County, Iowa Territory|Lee County]] March 8th 1840

My Dear Willford

As this is a memorable day to me I think I
cannot spend it better, than in writing to my dear Willford not being unmindful
that last sabbath was your birth ^day^ and knowing where we were last march about
this time, leads me to exclame Ah! what geat changes may take place in one
year and even in much less time? then my Willford was with me? 
but where is he now? far far from me acrost the mighty deep but I
desire to be contented and reconciled to the will of God in all things, praying
him to protect you from all evil and return you home once more to the
bosom of your family who are anxiously weighting your return. I wrote to
you the first of Jan. but then did not know that you had sailed for [[England|Eng.]]
but soon after received your last letter from [[New York|N.Y.]] dated Dec. 17th the letter
was sent back to me by [[Mr. Killbourn|Mr Killbourn]] after I sent it to the Office, I them drect
directed it to England according to your diretions and hope that you have
recived it before this time. I have received five letters from you since
you left home? the first dated [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] Sept. 30th. second N.Y. Oct 23rd
third Nov. 24th fourth Dec. 13th the fifth and last Dec. 17th and have written
you two before this,? when one is deprived of anothers company what a greate
blessing and consolation it is that we can converse with each other by letter
writing? I am anxiously looking daily for a letter from you but take this
opportunity of writing to you lest within a few days I shall not be as well able
to write as now? my health is not verry good at present but I desire to be tha
nkful that it is as good as it is. I can sit up most all day and sew the most
of the time? O my dear Willford I wish you could be with me for a little while
now it would be the greatest consolation to me that I could have.? two or
three nights since I dreamed that you came home to stay with me a week or
two, believe me, I was highly gratified but when I awoke and found it but
a dream I was sadly disappointed,? but as it cannot be so at present I desire to
commit myselfe into the hands of God, with all that I have? Our little Sarah
Emma is well bright, and harty, and I think as busiy a child as you ever saw
she frequently calls aloud for her pa-pa? she clings around me as though I
was all the friend she had here which causes me unpleasant fealings, when I think
how much I am alone in regard to relatives here? she is much company for me
[upside down]
Brother M^e^acham desires to be remembered to you? he has had the misfortune to break his leg this winter[[Abraham Owen Smoot|Brother]] and [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|sister Smoot]] send their respects to you - [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W Woodruff]] sends hers
to you and the brethren that went from Americ likewise all the saints in [[England|Eng]]. The family
where I live are verry kind to me I am comfortable for provision now. - My cow has lately
come in and she is so ugly about milking that I cant do much with her - shall I sell
the calf in the fall or change it for a heifer - I have two calves now 2 hens and 8 chickens
and 2 children and a small garden - I think you would excuse this bad writing and
disconnected sentences if you would see how I have to write - with one child in my
armes and another at my elbow, crying to be taken up - I hope that you will not
expose this letter for I feel quite ashamed of it - a part of it was written from the impulse
of a - moment write often for I feel verry anxious to hear from you often likewise
all the church are anxious to hear your letters red - I shall write to you often
I hope you will ever remember me in your prayres - be assured that I do the same
If I could see you I would tell you many things that I cannot write.
May the Lord bless, save, protect and return you home is the prayr of your
Phebe
Good by dear Willford be faith ful
and the Lord will take care of you.

SHIP LETTER

Phebe July 2d 1840
Answered Aug 21st 1840
by brother [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] - they are much company - for me wish you could see
them a while I kiss them every day for their pa. My dear Willford did
you know that 11 long months has passed away and you have not said one word
about comeing home in your letters - is seames almost an age, do tell me
something about it in your next letter - may the will of the Lord be done
but I hope that it will be to send you home this fall is not pray the Lord
that I may  have patience and grace to bear it for it is all that I can be most
more than I can bear, to think of spending another cold long winter with
out you - If you could send the children some red flannel for winter
it would be verry acceptable - and my every day clothes are getting quite poor
as I have been out of health ever since you left home but am quite smart now
have not had a chill for 3 weeks - will you not bring your [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|son]] a cap when
you come home, however I suppose that you do not have much meanes to do with
we are poor but how can we help, it if it could be your privilege to stay at home
and we both labour hard I should think litely of it for the sake of your society - but
to be poor and alone to[o] is rather hard. and no prospect of its being different
is rather discourageing is it not Willford. - [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Brother Joseph]] says that it is the
elders privilege to spend half of their time with their families will you not
remember that Willford. If you do not I shall be apt to remind you of it. -
I suppose that you will remember it much as you did staying at home 3
yeares after we were married - I think if you do not stay at home home a while
the next time you come we will put on the big pot and all go for I am quite
tired of liveing alone - perhapes you may think that I have got to scolding but
you knowe me and therefore must not mind small things. [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Brother Taylor]] has
sent for [[Leonora Cannon Taylor|sister Taylor]] to come to him in [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] without delay but brother
Joseph thought it not wisdom for her to go therefore she has given it up. I
heard [page torn] br he said that he and [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]] should go to [[England|England]] next season [page torn]
gathe[r] [page torn] the saints and the work would be finised there also that t[page torn]
wou[ld] [page torn] [b]egin to behead the saints within 2 years in England, [page torn]
Joseph [page torn] [h]as been advanceing new things to the church and publick [page torn]
late says that this earth was the largest ^panat [planet]^ that ever was made and that there
has been parts taken from it several times and at the time the 10 tribes
were lost there was a part taken from it and that that they would all come
back and be joined to it again and that would be the realing to &amp; fro like
a drunken man  &amp;c &amp;c There has been some strange things taking place here of late
2 weeks since there was 2 horses seen to cross the [[Mississippi River, United States|Missisipi river]] one red and
the other white, the red one landed about opposite Josep?s house the other went
father down, it was seen by 4 persons in a boat crossing the river they were
so near that they could see the water slop under their feet and distinguish the
colour of the cloths that the rider's had on - when the red horse moved his tail
there would be fire fly from it. and Joseph [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]] and Hiram ^have^ gone
to [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]] to hold a debate with the Governor and a presbeterian minister
have not heard the result. I suppose that you  have learned the defeat of the
brethren at [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] from the papers as brother Robinson to^ld^ me he sent
them to you. I hear that 10 of the 70 are about starting for England, I should
think you would need assistance according to your preaching places; brother
[[Jonathan Harriman Hale|Hale]] I hear is one of the number and I think if [[Joseph Bates Noble|Bates Nobles]] was to go somewhere
on a mission it would do him good. - It is not so sickly in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]]
or [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] yet as last season. Please give my respects to the brethren
and tell them that went with you that I have lately seen sister Taylor
[[Heber Chase Kimball|Young Kimbal]] [[Parley Parker Pratt|Pratt]] Hyde [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|Clark]] [[Theodore Turley|Turley]] &amp; [[Joseph Hadlock|Hadlock]]. they were well &amp; their
families. Dear Willford I want to see you so much but I believe that I can say upon
serious reflection that I have not wished you back once untill you have filled your
mission although I have had many trials since you left but I find God to be my
friend, I feel your absence to be a greate privation and sacrifice for me to make but
I hope and trust that you will be the means of doing much good and fill you mis
sion in the love and fear of God as soon as possible and come home to me and our
little ones as soon as possible with the smiles of heaven resting on you. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe W. Woodruff]] 
could not sit up to have my bed made, I was brought verry low in consequence 
of my situation little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] was verry sick at the same time both of our 
lives  were nearly dispaired of but through the mercy of God I got some better 
so that as soon as my house was called done I went into it, it had no door 
window or loft in it, and it was a hard matter for me to get it done any way they 
seamed unwilling to do it, I had no shelter for the cow and was much trou
bled to get wood, my house was verry open I was alone the most of the time, 
but could not sit up only a part of the time. I often felt that I was alone, 
a stranger in a strange land sick and ill provided for with my little Sarah clin
ging around me as though she had no other friend to look to for protection &amp; 
not knowing how it might turn with me would often cause me peculiar feelings, 
but I would often look back and ask myself the question did I leave my fathers 
house for the sake of honour, ease, or popularity, I think I did not but for the word of 
God then I would try to be reconciled to my situation but I found it to be verry 
hard work in the situation that I then was in? once I had a kind Willford to cheer 
me in my lonely hours, but then I had none. I lived in my house about 2 
months and quite as long as I wished in the situation that it was then in. Father 
Clark learned the situation that I was in he invited me to go to his house 
and spend the winter with ^then^ Sarah and my cow and calfe, and when I felt able 
to sew some for his family I accepted the invitation and am here now, in the 
spring he asked me to stay untill fall I have concluded to do so as they are building 
houses for the wives of the 12 in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] I shall probably voo move there in 
the fall I have flattered myself that I should have my Willford to help me move 
then, as I have moved 4 times since you left. Father [[John Smith, b. 1781|John Smith]] lives in 
my house now in Lovely street it was fitted up for for his family. Tell brother George 
Smith that his father and family are well have lately received a letter from him 
and sent an answer to it? I wrote a little in it to you as I was there on a visit. 
I have just returned f[ro]m a visit to Commerce and that neighbourhood the first 
one I have made [sin]ce you left home? I was gone 3 weeks Brother [[Albert Petty|Petty]] has 
returned from the South and settled in Commerce brother [[Stephen Grant Luce|Stephen Luce]] and 
brother [[Isaac Carter Odekirk|Outerkirk]] lives there likewise brother [[Albert Smith|Albert Smith]] and [[Ephraim Grant Luce|Ephraim Luce]] lives 
on the west side of the river. The brethren have a got a big field as they call it 
in brother [[Abraham Owen Smoot|Smoot]]s neighbourhood it contains about 300 acres of land he 
(Smoot) has lately gone out on a mission for six months, brother [[Dwight Webster|Webster]] 
from [[Connecticut|Connecticut]] has gone with him he has been here and spent a week with 
me and brought me a letter from [[Azubah Hart Woodruff|Mother Woodruff]] they were weell and 
mentioned haveing received a letter from you? I shall write to them as soon 
as I finish this- I found brother Webster to be a fine man. I suppose you knew 
that he and [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] were engaged to each other - he told me all about it when he 
was here. [[Sarah Milliken|Sarah Milliken]] expects to be married soon to a man out of the church 
he has lately joined the universal church so you can see how much faith ^he has^ in mormon
ism. [[Arthur Milliken|Arthur Milliken]] and [[Lucy Smith Millikin|Lucy Smith]] have lately been married Ilus 
Carter is married and still lives in [[New York|N.Y.]], I have received a letter from [[Ezra Carter, b. 1773|father]] 
and [[Sarah Fabyan Carter|mother Carter]] and she said that she expected to loose [[Shuah Coffin Carter Moulton|Shuah]] soon they were 
well, they want you to come there when you return home - [[Marietta Carter Holmes|sister Mary]] fails. 
Sister [[Rhoda Farnham Carter Scammans|Rhoda Scammans]] has got a young [[Sarah Carter Scammans|daughter]] 13 days older than our little, 
[[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willford Owen]], which I  suppose you have heard of long since for I wrote a 
letter to you before I was confined but reserved a space in it to give you the news 
and kept it by me untill after my confinement then immediately had it finis
hed and sent it to the office I there gave you an account of my situa
tion but lest you have not received it I will say that I may had a 
fine son on the 22nd of March whome I call Willford for his long absent 
father he was taken with the hooping cough when 5 weeks old but has got over it 
now and grows finely it is said that he resembles his mother much. 
Sarah Emma grows f^i^nely is backward about talking but says many words 
calls poor, pa,pa, &amp; prety pa pa many times in a day, she calls the babe pretty 
boy and pretty Willo, she runs out of doors to play much of the time, and is as busy as 
you ever saw a little one, she and Willford wrote to their papa in the letter that I sent[[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] [[Lee County, Iowa Territory|Lee County]] July 2nd 1840

My Dear Willford

It is with peculiar feelings that that
I sit down to write to you at this time. I have not heared from you 
for nearly 5 months untill now, and I have been left to wonder at it, some 
times thinking that you might be in prison, or where you could not write 
I have felt more than common lonely of late, for what reason I do not know 
but your letter came to hand the 24th of June bearing date of April 24 which 
was cordially received. I was pleased to hear of your health and prosperity in 
the ministry but sorry to hear that you had not received any of my letters, 
this is the 5 one that I have written you since you left [[New York|N.Y.]] one of and they 
were writen verry ful I told you how things were with me in 
them. I directed three of them to [[Preston, Lancashire, England|Preston]], [[Lancashire, England|Lankenshire]], [[England|England]], 
another to W. Woodruff in care of [[Alfred Cordon|Alfred Cord[on] ]] [page torn] [c]lub buildings, Navigation 
rode [[Burslem, Staffordshire, England|Buurslem]] [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]] England according to the directions in
your letter written from Jan. 29. and this ^I^ shall direct to [[Liverpool, Lancashire, England|Liverpool]] in care 
of [[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] hopeing that you will be more likely to get it. I sent one 
by brother [[Orson Hyde|Hyde]] and [[John Edward Page|Page]] when they started on their mission to the 
Jews. I have received three from you since you arrived in England 
one dated Jan. 12th another 29th then this last one April 24. I do hope 
that you will get them ^mine^ for I wrote much that you would like to 
know about my situation, house, cow, sickness, moveing from Lovely street 
to [[Timothy Baldwin Clark|father Clarks]], &amp;c, &amp;c, which if you have not heard might be inter
esting to you. as it is quite a task for me to write now haveing two 
little one around ^one^ and poor health (yet I have taken the utmost pains 
to write to you since you left home) I will give you a brief sketch 
of these things. You left  me in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]], I kept about the house 2 weeks after, 
then was taken with the chills and fever went out to sister [[Margaret Thompson McMeans Smoot|Smoots]] stayed 
there about 10 weeks was confined to my bed the most of the time for days &amp; days

My Dear Willford

I think that you will believe me when 
I say that it is with peculiar feelings that I commence this sheet to you 
my dear Willford what will be your feelings when I say that yesterday 
I was called to witness the departure of our little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] from this 
wold world- yes she is gone ? the relentless hand of death has snatched her from 
my embrace ? but Ah! she was to lovely to kind to affectionate to live in 
this wicked world ? when looking on her I have often thought how
I should feell to part with her I thought I thought could not live 
without her especially in the absence of my companion - but she is gone
the Lord has taken her to himself for some wise purpose ? It is a severe 
trial for me to pass through particularly so in you absence but the 
Lord has stood by me in a wonderfully manner I can see and feell that 
he has taken her home and will take better care of her than I possibly 
could for a little while untill I shall go and meett her ? Yes Willford
we have one little angel in heaven and I think it likely her spirit 
has visited you before this time ? I do not know how to live without her
she I used to call her poor pa-pa and pretty pa-pa many times in a day 
she left a kiss for her pa-pa just with me just before she died ? she 
eat her dinner as well as usuall thursday about 4 oclock she was
taken with a prestness for breath we done every thing for her that we 
could called for the elders and had her anointed a number of times and 
hands laid on her but all to no avail the next day her spirit took its flight
from this to another world without a groan so that now I am dep-
rived of every thing near and dear to me but my little darling [[Wilford Woodruff, Jr.|Willford]] 
for the things of the world are empty and vain to me and he is not verry 
well ? Today Willford and I with quite a number of our friend ac-
compaings us came over to Commerce to pay our last respects to our
little darling in seeing her decently buried ? she had no relatives to followMrs

Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Sister]]
As Willford has reserved for me a page to fill, I will now cheerfully (tho? in something of a hurry)
seat myself to pen you a few lines. I recieved your Letter at the hands of my brother and was truly glad to
hear from you, was sorry however to hear of the ill state of your health as also that of your family, but
how it will soon be improved. Wilford as you are aware is quite unwell, and we feel as you write, much
anxiety respecting him, as he is about to undertake such a journey. and it seems to me as tho? I could
not have him leave us so soon, but then, we know that God has called and said ?Go?, and
shall we worms of the dust say stay' Nay, but let us rather rejoice that he is accounted worthy
to become a messenger from God to the nations of the earth. but still my natural feelings at times
gain the ascendency and I can hardly reconcile myself to have him leave us. I need not say that
W. is a brother that I set much by of this you probably are aware. but as [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] is gone, my
affections return with double force upon Willford. I place confidence in him as I formerly did
in Asahel, looking to him, as a friend and protector, I hope however I shall not forget that
my comforts and blessings flow from God, the bountiful giver of all good,

I suppose I shall have to be brief at this time, but I shall write you from time to ti[me] [page torn]
shall hope to hear from you often, and do give us a particular account of things an[d] [page torn]
with you, for we shall ever be glad to hear, and also as it respects the situation of the church.
I would ask no greater blessing than to be permitted to take up my residence with the Saints with the
Saints at the west, I would be willing to undergo ma[n]y earthly privations. I have felt as tho? I should
like it much could I be with you whilst W. is gone his mission, but I suppose it would not be
considered consistent at present. but I do feel as tho? I should be permitted e'er long, to stand on
Mount Zion with the blessed company. pray for me Sister, that I may live in such a manner
as to be accounted worthy to escape the just judgments of God abroad in the land, and finally
have a standing given me with the saints of God. I have been quite unwell most of the time since
W. has been at home and consequently have not received as much pleasure in hearing him converse upon
this Latter day work, as I otherwise should have done. but we have had a very pleasant with him, and
shall remember it with much pleasure. the greatest complaint I make is that I have not had scarcely
any apportunity of conversing with him myself. I hope the Lord will grant that he may have grace
given him to perform his mission acceptably. that the Lord would be with him and bless him
continually. grant him with the rest of the company a safe and pleasant journey over the waters
and when their mission is fill'd return them safe to the bosom of their friends.

My best wishes for the welfare of yourself and babe, I remain yours, Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]]with peculiar feelings as I journied by land the places whare you suffered
with your sickness [Eunice?s handwriting, Wilford?s words] with regard to crossing the [[Lake Erie, United States|Lake]], we had a very tedious time of it. were
caught in a line storm, and was in it 3 days on our way to [[Buffalo, Erie County, New York|Buffalo]], at which place on the 13th we ^I^ took line
boat for [[Albany, Albany County, New York|Albany]], arrived at Albany on the 19th. during which time in consequence of the cold I took on the Lake
with the crowded situation of the boat, caused a return of the chills and fever, which I had every day for
the last week of my journey. I took stage at Albany at 10 oclock at night, travell'd through the night, and
also the next day, and finally arrived at [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] about sunset. spent the night at Aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Wheelers]], the next
morn being the 21st of Sept. I arrived at [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] house at [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], and had the happy privilege thro?
the blessing of God, of once more meeting Fathers household face to face, have now been at home about 10 days
and immediately on my return home as I began to be recruited from my journey, my health began to
amend, and did not have my turns of fever and ague, although I have felt the effects of it in some
degree from day to day, but I would here say that I have felt perfectly easy as regards the affliction of my
body feeling confident that I shall soon recover my usual health. and I would here say as before that I do
not wish you to give yourself an uneasiness as it regards my health, only give me your prayrs, and all will
be well. I would just also remark that I lacked nothing on my journey as it regards my temporal wants, and
had 50 cents left when I arrived at Fathers, and my purse is beginning to be replenished so that I shall
be enabled to continue my journey in a few days. since at home I have had an interview with most of the
Saints that belong to this small branch of the church. Uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]], Sister [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna Cossitt]] brother Dwight?
Webster &amp;c. were among the number, and I felt truly ^to^ rejoices before the Lord to find them firm in the faith
and holding fast whereunto they had attained, and determined to do the will of the Lord henceforth, and they
have a Zion spirit desiring to gather with the Saints. I would say that my Grand mother, [[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|Anna Thompson]],
departed this life a day or two since. was buried yesterday. We have visited Uncle [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart]] found him quite low
and to all appearance near the borders of the grave. as it regards the rest of our friends they are usually well,
I have not as yet heard from any of our friends in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], but I expect soon to see brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] in
[[New York|New York]].

Give my respects to Sisters [[Mary Ann Angell Young|Young]] all the Saints in [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] and [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]] from head to foot
inasmuch as you have an apportunity, tell brother [[Pierce Hawley|Hawley]] that I have had an interview with
his brothere in law [[Robert P. Sattley|Mr Satler]], he was very anxious to see him. I must now draw to a close
as Sister [[Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster|Eunice]] will fill the remainder of this sheet, b I hope I shall be gratified with a
Letter from you before I leave New York.

I still remain yours in the strongest ties,
Wilford Woodruff

[still in Eunice?s handwriting]
Mrs [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Phebe Woodruff]]

N.B. I would here remark that I discovered your ?petition? soon after leaving home and was highly
edified with the spirit thereof thereof and I pray God my heavenly Father at all times to answer
all such prayrs that may ascend in our behalf.
