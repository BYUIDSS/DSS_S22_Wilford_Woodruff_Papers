[rest of page blank]they were suffered therefore to be forbid; and in Exod. 
Chapt. 28, saying these are the garments which they shall make,
this they say excludes all that are not here named, &amp; Moses
being commanded at the burning bush to put off
his shoes, for the ground on which he stood was Holy,
for the same reasonâ because of the extryaordinary
presence of God then in that place, they make a further
argument for it. For say they, the Temple was all Holy,
for the same reason, that is because of the extraordinary
presence of God, then residing in the Shekinah over the
Mercy Seat, (this was the sacred name) &amp; for further
reasons, it was most strictly exacted, that the priest should
^be^ always barefoot in the Temple, but the Jews &amp; eastern Nations
uncover their feet, that no dust or pollution might 
profane the Holy ground. Herne [Herein] pulling off a shoe among
the ancients, indicated reverence for the presence of God.
The customs was also expressive of the covenant of a bargain,
or covenant amongst the eastern nations; the party
conveying away a right or privilege, took off a shoe &amp;
gave it to his fellow, as a pledge of his fidelity.


Amongst the Jews it was a token of renunciation, thus the
kinsman of Ruth renounced his claim upon her in
favor of Boaz; she loosed his shoe from his foot to show
she was released from all engagements by which the laws
of the country, had bound her to the claims of her nearest
relations &amp;c, &amp;c.

of oil, &amp; 75 wine gallons, &amp; alone five pints each, which
was the contents of the [ear] for liquids; he gave them likewise
20,000 measures of wine, of the same contents. He gave the King
of Egypt as much; and the Tyrian workman all, yearly,
120,000 measures of wheat, and as many of Barley; so that
all the workmen had evry year, 602,850 measures of
wheat, &amp; as many of Barley; so that all the workman
had evry year besides 602,850 measures of wine, &amp; the
like quantity of oil &amp;c. He gave likewise to Hirain King of
Tyre, 20 towns in Galilee, &amp; a gold pillar of great value.
Villopandus says there never was such a magnificent
structure on earth as the Temple built by King Solomon;
the gold &amp; silver vessels consecrated to the use of the Temple, came
to one thousand &amp; nine one million, five hundred fifty one
thousand &amp; two hundred &amp; three pounds four shillings, besides the
gold plates with which the walls, roof, &amp; pavement were lined; the
gold nails &amp; jewels above mentioned are not valued. He gave
as a free gift to the workman, six millions, seven hundred,
sixty three thousand &amp; seventy seven pounds; besides their daily
wages &amp; diet which are not valued, nor have we any valuation
of the Brass &amp; other materials made use of in the building. V
Villapandus reckoned the jewel to excede this sum. Josephus expresses
4 hundred &amp; 40 thousand gold vessels, &amp; thirteen hundred &amp; forty thousand
of silver for the use of the Temple = Ten thousand priests vestments
of silk with purple girdles &amp; two million of purple vestments for
the singers. The Treasure left by King David towards building
the Temple one thousand eight hundred &amp; seventeen million
six hundred fifty four thousand &amp; twenty four Roman crowns of gold
Page 5joined by golden nails the heads of which were of curious
workmanship, each of those nails were 25 ounces of gold, with
most precious jewles jewels, of various coulours, set in &amp; stone like
the stars in the firmament. There belonged to the Temple 440,000
vessels of gold and 1,340,000 of silver, which took up 108,000 talents
and 2,000 shekels of gold, in the whole amounting to 1,817,654,024
Roman gold crowns, &amp; of silver a million of talents, which
is 1,465,480,000 more such crowns; all this was consecrated to
the Temple, besides what was laid out on the wages &amp; food of the
workman &amp; other materials. The reduction of a Roman gold
crown, which is about six shillings in English a peace, the gold amounts
to five hundred &amp; forty millions, two hundred &amp; three pounds ninty
&amp; six thousand, &amp; two hundred &amp; three pounds, four shillings. Sterling;
and the silvers came to four hundred &amp; thirty nine million,
three hundred &amp; forty two thousand pounds Sterling. The weight
of the brazen alter was 2,000 talents; &amp; that of the Brazen Sea
8,640. The roof of the Temple, being covered with plates of
Brass, comes to 500,141 talents, and 103 pounds weight. The two
brass columns or pillars, called [blank and [blank] at the enterance
of the Sanctuary weighed 19,027 talents, &amp; being covered
with gold of an inch thick it amounted to 5,850 talents
of gold. Solomon employed in building the Temple 401,900
Israelites, the same number of Lydonians, also Tyrians
&amp; Egyptians, to each of whom, besides their daily wages and
diet, he gave when the Temple was finished, ten shekels of
gold. Solomon also gave the King of Tyre's household,
yearly, 20,000 ears or measures of wheat, each containing
eight bushels &amp; a half, Winchester measure, &amp; twenty measuresthey were of stone so thick as three men could scarscely
fathom them; none less than fifteen cubits &amp; of the Corinthian
order, beautiful to a wonder; the windows bends those
in the pavement to let light into the appartments under
ground were 2,246 &amp; the length of the wall which inclosed
the Temple was 3,081 cubits, and six cubits &amp; a hands breadth
thick, and betwixt this wall &amp; the porch of the gentiles, was 37 1/2
cubits broad, &amp; 768 cubits long. In the middle of the
Temple there stood the House of God, &amp; was encompassed with
its own wall 100 cubits broad &amp; 250 long &amp; the gates were
covered with gold 13 cubits high &amp; 8 broad, the bredth of the
Tower was 64 cubits the hights to the cornor stone were
125 cubits &amp; the holy place 12 cubits high &amp; 20 broad &amp;
40 long 2 1/2 thick without any windows which divided the sanctuary
from the Holy of Holies; in this structure were 732 chambers, &amp;
most all of them square; &amp; none less than 12 cubits of extent
but many of them much more, there were many appartments
under ground as kitchens, sacred &amp; profane, also a large store
house for the first fruits of Israel, &amp; a vast Hall over the Sanctim
Sanctorium whare the Tables, curtains &amp; the rest of the instru-
ments of the Tabernacle, &amp; sacred offerings were kept. The beams
were 12 1/2 cubits long, 1 1/5 thick, all of cedar, 1 7/8 broad, with
sculptures carved work, and gold plates; the floor of the
whole structure was paved with stones of various colours,
very precious, &amp; so artifilly artificially laid in chequirs [checkers] work
that they looked like one entire stone; the walls, roof &amp; floor
of the sanctuary were all covered with plates of fine gold,Page 1st from page 38

A further Account of King Solomons Temple.
The prodigiousness of the work may be understood by the
number of the men employed in this structure, their
being 10,000 men per month in Lebanon to hew down
timber; 70,000 to carry burdens, 80,000 to hew the
stones, &amp; 3,300 overseers who were all employed for secven
seven years.      There was another edifice built over
the Temple of the same dimensions with itself &amp; makes
the whole height 120 cubits, and the whole building
was of free stone, so exactly joined, that it seemed
to be one entire solid rock, growing there of its own
accord; this Temple was encompassed with a wall of three
cubits high to exclude the profane multitude &amp; admit
none but the priest, &amp; it was called Gison; without
covered with gold, &amp; all the people that were purified might
enter here. and from the ramparts which supported the wall
was 800 cubits on the top equal to a common place, or two
foot &amp; a half, &amp; the length of the ramparts below was 1,000 cubits
the bredth 100 cubits &amp; the highth 300 cubits, the stones of
which they were built were 40 cubits long 25 broad &amp; 8

The number of Israelites under the direction of Moses &amp;
Aaron, that came out of Egypt from Pharoah King of Egypt
[end of sideways text]

numbers were 814,950 besides the mixed multitude that followed
them, it ^also^ follows the Egyptians Armies overwhelmed in the red
sea, &amp; pharoah in the midst of them. this took place on a Monday
May 11th and 1461 years before the birth of Christ.     5. The Representation
of Moses bringing down the Tables of Stone from Mount Sinai
showing the Israelites at the foot of the Mount, which was in
1491 (born in 1574) and sent the ten plagues of Egypt in 1492
5 The representation of the first tent used as a Tabernacle at the
foot of Mount Sinai. This is to represent the Tabernacle that
was reared in the wilderness &amp; taken with them During their
march through the promised land &amp;c that contained the different
articles. The Holy fire was kept in it with the Ark, with which
all burnt offerings were offered, descended at all times from
Heaven at the consecration of Aaron, &amp; was preserved
by the priests so long as the Tabernacle was in existence
untill the Babylonist Captivity, from which time it was
never reviewed. This Tent or Tabernacle which Moses &amp; Aaronand Eleazar and Phineas was to be their G. Wardens
so Joshua &amp; Caleb brought Moses down by night &amp; buried
him privately, in the easternmost part of the valley of pisgath
Mount as it was Moses's last desire, &amp; to be kept secret from
all the congregation of Israel, for fear they might revolt or
rebel &amp;c &amp;c (see Page 17.)     5 Moses &amp; Aaron were installed
in power &amp; invested with all the apparlel of High Priest
in leaving Egypt with a rod or Staff in their hands, also
with a breast plate buckled in front which expressed Urim 
and Thummin, which signifies perfect light; it was that which
led the Israelites safely in possession of the promised land
5th The representation of Moses &amp; Aaron on the Mount, which
with the Israelites under their direction that came out
from Egypt, from pharoah &amp; passed the Red Sea or their march
to the promised land, as God appointed it &amp; theirs
[rest of page blank]which were cast off, &amp; his hand over his eyes, as a 
sympathetic sign of reverence &amp; humility. 5 "The representation 
of the High priest's Mitre whareon is a plate of gold, engraved 
Holiness to the Lord."
5. Twelve lights placed in a triangular
foirm, is to represent the Twelve stones that was laid on the banks 
of the river Jordan, also to the Twelve tribes of Israel, &amp;c and 
was placed at Gilgal, on the east border of Jerico, these stones
were named, &amp; each Tribe bore on his sho^u^lder a stone according 
to their different Tribes &amp; superiority with the Twelve Tribes,
engraved, namely Reuben Judah Gad Zebuloun Dan, Simeon, 
Asher, Joseph, Levi, Napthali, Issachar, and Benjamin. this was 
in the year of 2942; so the Israelites crossed the Jordan on dry 
land, similar to the Red Sea under the command of Joshua 
&amp;c, and encamped in full strength in the plains of Gilgal; the 
reason the st Sun &amp; Moon stood still at the command of 
Joshua, was owing to the Amorites worshiping them as their 
gods so Joshua made them retreat from their gods in terror
&amp; with great slaughter.     5 (Moses &amp; Aaron) Aaron 
died on Mount Hor but Moses created a pillar before his 
death on Mount Ebel (on the other side of Jordan) &amp; inscribed 
on it, "the blessings of obedience &amp; the curses of disobedience
which he pronounced at that time in the presence of all the 
congregation of Israel, then he ascended to the summit on top 
of Mount Pisgah, there he took a survey of the land of Canaan 
in the presence of Joshua &amp; Caleb in the 120th year of his age 
and 1451 years before Christ. it was there &amp; then Moses gave up 
his office as the Leader of Israel to Joshua. Caleb his deputy From Page 13 in Book

No. 4: The representation of the Ark of the covenant that 
was borne by the High Priest at the time that they surrounded the 
walls of Jericho seven times, making long blasts with their 
Ram's horns, &amp;c. The Seven Lights on the plate is to represent the 
High Priest that marched seven times going round the 
walls of Jericho; &amp; bore along with them the Tabernacle
&amp; took its rise from the th time of Joshua, when the Israelites 
had gained possession of the land of Canaan, by the overthrow 
of Jericho, which was utterly destroyed; for the Temple ^tabernacle^ with 
the Ark was then in Gibeon, &amp; kept there untill the final dedication 
of the Temple by King Solomon, &amp; -------- was the word that King Solomon 
expressed by smiting his breast three times, when so and so was 
missing from the Temple &amp;c

Trade MSome idea tof my early infor-
mation to be gained from a
novelty presented on our app
roach to [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]] of a
Steeple was anounced by
[[Philo Woodruff|Philo]]. My curiosity was greatly
excited. A Steeple! I looked
abroadâupon every tree
and under every old log lying
within sightâbut in vain.
I accused my brother of
deceiving meâhe persisted in
his assertion that he could
see the Steeple declaring
it was "plain as day"
I watched the direction of hisRemember seeing [[Ozem Thompson Woodruff, b. 1804|Thompson]]

for man &amp; a resting place for the
weary traveller that he may con-

glory of this the corner stone
thereof that he may also receive

Behold verily I say unto you

pertaining to my boarding [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|house]]
which I have commanded you
to build for the boarding of strangers
let it be built unto my name
&amp; let my name be named upon
it, &amp; let my Servant [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] &amp;
his house have place therein
from generation to generation
for this annointing have I put
upon his head, that his blessing shall
also be put upon the heads of
his posterity after him, &amp; as I
said unto Abraham concerning
the kindreds of the earth even so I
say unto my Servent Joseph
in thee &amp; in they [thy] seed shall the
kindreds of the Earth be blessed.to do a work &amp; have been hindered
by the hands of their enemies &amp;
by oppression saith the Lord your
God, for I am the Lord your God
&amp; will save all those of your Brethren
who have been pure in heart &amp;
have been slain in the Land of
[[Missouri|Missouri]] saith the Lord. And again
verily I say unto you I com-
mand you again to build a
[[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|house]] to my name even in this
[[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|place]] that ye may prove your-
selves unto me that ye are faithful
in all things whatsoever I command
you that I may bless you
&amp; crown you with honour immor
tality &amp; eternal life.repent not, &amp; hate me saith the Lord
God. Therefore for this cause have
I accepted of the offerings of those men
whome I commanded to build up a
city &amp; an House unto my name
in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] Missouri
&amp; were hindered by their enemies saith
the Lord your God. and I will an-
swer judgment wrath &amp; indignation
wailing &amp; anguish &amp; gnashing of
teeth upon their heads unto the third
&amp; fourth generation so long as they
repent not and hate me saith the
Lord your God. and this I make
an ensample unto you for your
consolation concerning all those
who have been commanded toLord. Verily, verily, I say unto
you that when I give a commandme
nt unto any of the Sons of men
to do a work unto my name &amp; those
Sons of men go with all their mi
ghts &amp; with all they have to perform
that work &amp; cease not their diligence
and their enemies come upon the-
m &amp; hinder them from performing
that work behold it behoveth me
to require that work no more at
the hands of those Sons of men
but to accept of their offering
&amp; the iniquity &amp; transgression of
my Holy laws &amp; commandments
I will visit upon the Heads of those
who hindered my work unto the third
&amp; forurth generation so long as theyvoice of my Servents whome I have
appointed they shall not be blessed
because they pollute my Holy ground
and mine Holy Ordinances and charte[rs]
&amp; miyne ^my^ Holy words which I give
unto them, &amp; it shall come to pass
that if you build a house unto
my name &amp; do not do the things
that I say I will not perform the
oath which I make unto you
neither fulfill the promise which
ye expect at my hands saith the
Lord, for instead of blessings, ye
by your own works bring cursi[ngs]
wrath, indignation &amp; judgment upo[n]
your own heads by your follies
&amp; by all your abominations which
you practice before me saith theall things pertaining to this [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|house]]
&amp; the priesthood thereof &amp; the place
whareon it shall be built, &amp; ye
shall build it on the place whare
you have contemplated building
it, for that is the place which
I have chosen ^for you^ to build it. If
ye labour with all your might
I will consecrate that spot that it
shall be made holy &amp; if my
people will harken unto my voice
&amp; unto the voice of my Servants
whome I have appointed to lead my
people behold verily I say unto
you they shall not be moved
out of their place, but if they will
not harken to my voice nor unto thethe beginning of the revelations &amp;
foundation of Zion, &amp; for the glory
&amp; honour &amp; endowment of all her
municipals and ^are^ ordained by the
Ordinance of my holy house
which my people are always com-
manded to build unto my Holy
name. And verily I say unto
you let this [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|house]] be built
unto my name that I may
reveal mine ordinances therein
unto my people, for I deign to
reveal unto my Church things
which have been kept hid from
before the foundation of the world, 
things which pertain to the dispensat
ion of the fulness of times &amp; I will
shew unto my Servant [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]Moses that he should build a tab-
ernacle that they should bear it
with them in the wilderness
&amp; to build a house in the Land of
promise that those ordinances
might be revealed which had
been hid from before the world
was therefore varily I say unto
you that your annointings
&amp; your washings &amp; your bap-
tisms for the dead, &amp; your Solomn
Assemblies, &amp; your memorials
for your Sacrifizces by the Sons
of Levi and for your oracles in
your most Holy places wharein
you receive conversations and
your statutes &amp; judgments forpriesthood ordained that you may
receive honour &amp; glory. And after
this time your baptisms for
the dead by those who are scattered
abroad are not acceptable unto me
Saith the Lord for it is ordained that
in Zion &amp; in her Stakes &amp; in
Jerusalem those places which I
have appointed for refuge shall
be the places for your baptisms
for your dead.

And again 
varily I say unto you how
shall your washings be acceptable
unto me except you perform
them in a house which you
have built to my name?
For, for this cause I commandedappointment your baptisms
for your dead shall not be
acceptable unto me &amp; if you
do not these things at the end
of the appointment you shall
be rejected as a Church, with
your Dead, Saith the Lord, your
God. For verily I say unto you
that after you have had sufficient
time to build a [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|house]] wherein the
ordinances of baptizing for the
dead belongeth &amp; for which the
same was instituted from
before the foundation of the wor
world your baptisms for your
dead cannot be acceptable unto me
for therein are the keys of the Holyunto you or which he hath
taken away even the fullness of
the priesthood, for a Baptismal
Font there is not upon the Earth
that they my Servants may
be baptized for those who are
dead for this ordinance belongeth
to my house &amp; cannot be accept
able to me ownly in the days of
your poverty wherein you
are not able to build a house
unto me, but I Command you
all ye my Saints to build an
[[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|house]] unto me ^And I grant unto you a sufficient time to build an house unto me^ and during
this time your baptisms
shall be acceptable unto me.
But behold at the end of thisand say unto them, come ye
with all your gold &amp; your Silver
&amp; your precious Stones &amp; with all
your antiquities &amp; with all who
have knowledge of antiquities
that will come may come &amp;
bring the Box tree, and the fir tree
&amp; the pine tree together with all the
precious trees of the Earth, &amp; with
Iron with copper and with brass
&amp; with zinc &amp; with all your pre-
cious things of the Earth &amp; build
a [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|house]] unto my name for
the most High to dwell therein
for their is not place found on the
Earth that he may come &amp; restore
again that which was lost untoafar to lodge therein, therefore let
it be a good [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|house]] worthy of all accep-
tation that the weary traveller may
find health &amp; saftey while he shall
contemplate the word of the Lord,
&amp; the corner stone I have appointed
for Zion. This house shall be a
healthy habitation if it be built
unto my name. And if the Governor
which shall be appointed unto it shall
not suffer any pollution to come
upon it it shall be Holy or the
Lord your God shall ^will^ not dwell
therein.

And again verily I say 
unto you let all my Saints
from afar &amp; send ye swift 
Messengers yea Chosen Messengershead the Office of a Bishoprick like
unto my Servant [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]]
that he may receive the consecratio-
ns of mine house, that he may
administer blessings upon the
heads of the poor of my people saith
the Lord. Let no man despise my
servant [[George Miller|George]] for he shall honour
me. Let my servant George &amp; my
servant [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] &amp; my servant
[[John Snider|John Snider]] &amp; others build a [[Nauvoo House, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|house]]
unto my name such an one as my
servant [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] shall show unto
them, upon the place which he shall
show unto them also, and it shall
be for a house for boarding a house
that strangers may come frommy name that when [[Lyman Wight|he]] shall
finish his work that I may receive
him unto myself even as I did
my servant [[David Wyman Patten|David Patten]] who is
with me at this time. And also my
servant [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]] and
also my aged Servent Joseph Smith
Sen.r who sitteth with Abram at
his right hand and blessed &amp; holy
is he for he is mine.

And again
varily I say unto you my
Servant [[George Miller|George Miller]] is without
guile he may be trusted because
of the integrity of his heart, &amp; for the
love he has to my testimony
I the Lord loveth him. I therefore
say unto you I seal upon hishour of affliction; &amp; [[John Cook Bennett|his]] reward
shall not fail if he receive council
&amp; for his love he shall be great
for he shall be mine if he do this
saith the Lord I have seen the
work he hath done which I
eaccept if he continue &amp; will cro
crown Him with blessings &amp;
great glory.

And again I say
unto you that it is my will
that my servant [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]]
should continue preaching for
Zion in the spirit of meekness
confessing me before the world
&amp; I will bear him up as on
eagles wings &amp; he shall begot glory 
&amp; honour to himself &amp; untoin all things from henceforth
&amp; [[Robert Blashel Thompson|he]] shall be great in mine eyes
but let him remember that his
Stewardship will I require at
his hands.

And again verily
I say unto you blessed is my
Servent [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] for I
the Lord loveth him because 
of the integrity of his heart &amp;
because he loveth that which
is right before me saith the Lord.
Again let my Servant John
C. Bennet help you in your
labour in sending my word
to the kings &amp; people of the Earth
&amp; stand by you even upon my
Servent [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] in the an hour when ye think not
of, and where whare shall be the
safety of my people and refuge for
those who shall be left of them?
Awake! O Kings! ^of the earth^ Come ye! O
Come ye, with your gold &amp;
your Silver to the help of my
people, to the house of the daug-
hter of my people Zion.

And again verily I say unto [[Joseph Smith Jr.|you]]
let my Servent Robert B. Thomp-
son help you to write this pro
clamation for I am well pleased
with him &amp; that he should be
with you. Let him therefore
harken to your council &amp; I will
bless him with a miultiplicity of
blessings Let him be faithful &amp; true.glory as the flower thereof which soon
falleth away that they may be left also

of teeth if they reject my servants &amp;
my testimony which I have revealed
unto them. And again I will visit

A Revelation given to Joseph
Smith [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]] Jan 19th 1841

Verily thus saith the Lord unto
you my Servant Joseph Smith
I am well pleased with your
offerings and acknowledgements which
you have made for unto this end
have I raised you up, that I might
show forth my wisdom throughto a deacon that there may not be disorder
The spirit that opposes the authority of God
is of the devel. We are acquainted with the
course the devel persues in making trouble
in the church of Christ. Satan is not so
destitute of power as some suppose he
is The Lord &amp; all Heaven have had to wage
war with him &amp; his influence in Eterni
ty, &amp; it is by keeping the Law of God &amp;
giving heed to the officers of his church in
order to overcome. Let not the presidi
ng Elder give up his place to every Elder
that may come along saying stand by
untill I speak for if an Angel of God shou
ld come down from Heaven he would req-
uire the stewardship concerning the lambs
of the flock at the hand of the presiding Elderwith my servant [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]
whithersoever my servant Jose-
ph shall counsel them obta-
ining the fulfillment of these
commandments which I have
given unto you and leave the
residue in mine hands even
so â Amen

Items of [[Parley Parker Pratt|P. P. Pratts]] instruction at [[New York|New York]] Conference
It is a wrong spirit to speak evil of the
authorities that God has set in his Church
even the least of them to a deacon, for
all [heaven] will respect the authority they

behold this is my will therefore if you
cannot obtain five hundredwhich I have consecrated to be
the land of Zion even your own
land. After these testimonies wh-
ich ye have brought before me against
them ye shall course ^curse^ them &amp; who-
msoever ye will course ^curse^ I will curse

of them that hate me. Let no man
be afraid to lay down his life for
my sake for whoso layeth down
his life for my sake shall find it

his life for my sake is not my deciple.
It is my will that my servent [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]]that my Servant {[shorthand?]} is the man
to wholm I liken the Saints to
whome the Lord of the  vineyard spoke
in the parable which I have given
unto you. Therefore let my
Servent [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] say unto the strength
of my house my young men
&amp; middle aged gather together unto
the land of Zion upon the land which
I have bought with monies that
have been consecrated unto me
&amp; let all the churches send up wise 
men with their monies &amp; purchase
lands even as I have commanded
them. &amp; inasmuch as mine
enemies come against you to
drive you from off my goodly landMoses led the Children of Israel
for ye are the Children of Israel
&amp; of the seed of Abram &amp; ye m
ust needs be led out of bondage
by power &amp; with an out stretched
arm "even as your fathers were
led" at the first even so shall the
Redemption of Zion, therefore let 
not your hearts faint, for I
say not unto you as I said unto
your fathers, mine Andels [Angels] shall
go up before you &amp; not my pre
sence, but I say unto you
mine angel shall go up before
you &amp; also my presence &amp; in
time ye shall possess the goodly land.
Verily, verily, I say unto youcometh the blessing which I have
promised in a former command-
ment after your tribulations
&amp; the tribulations of your Brethren 
your redemption &amp; the redemption
of your brethren even their rede
mption to the land of Zion to be
established no more to be thrown
down; nevertheless if they shall
pollute their inheritance they shall
be thrown down for I will not
spare them if they pollute their
Inheritances. Behold I say unto
you that the redemption of Zion
must needs come of power, therefore
I [blank] ^[r]^ ^[g]^ raise up unto my people a
[page folded] âan who shall lead them like asand ever. But inasmuch as they keep
not my commandments &amp; harken not
to observe all my words then the Kingdom
of the world [blank] prevail against them, for
they were set to be saviors of men
and inasmuch as they are not the sav-
iors of men they are as salt that hath
lost its savor and is thenceforth good
for nothing but to be cast out &amp;
be trodden under foot of men,
but verily I say unto you I have
decreeed that your brethren which had
been scattered shall return to the
lands of their inheritantsces and build up
the waste place of Zion [ink change] for after
which tribulation as I have said
unto you in a former commandmentbecause they did not hearken altogether
unto the precepts &amp; commandments
which I gave unto them. But verily I
say unto you that I have decreed a
decree which my people shall realize
inasmuch as they harken from this hour
unto the council which I the Lord their
God shall give unto them. Behold they shall
for I have decreed it, it shall begin to
prevail against mine enemies from
this very hour, and by harkning to obse
rve all the words which I the Lord their
God shall speak unto them they shall
never cease to prevail untill the
Kingdoms of the world are subdued
under my feet &amp; the earth is given
unto the Saints to possess it foreverA Revelation given at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]

Verily I say unto you my friends
Behold I will give unto you a revelation
&amp; commandment that you may
know how to act in the discharge of your
duties concerning the salvation and
redemption of your brethren who have
been scattered from the land of Zion
being driven &amp; smitten by the hand of
mine enemies on whome I will pour
out my wrath without measure in
mine own time for I have suffered them
thus far that they might fill up the mea
sure of their iniquity that their cup might
be full &amp; that those who call themselves after
my name might be chastened for a little
season with a sore &amp; grievious chastizementwith famine, &amp; plague, &amp; earthqua-
kes &amp; the thunder of heavens &amp; the fieres

Prophecy or Commandment given December 25th AD 1832

Verily thus saith the Lord concerni
ng the wars that will shortly come to
pass begining at the rebellion of
[[South Carolina|South Carolina]] which will eventu-
ally terminate in the death &amp; misery
of many souls; and the days will come
that war will be poured out upon
all Nations begining at this place for
behold the Southern States shall be
divided against the Northern Statested &amp; fulfilled after her redemption;
There has been a day of calling but
the time has come for a day of chusing
&amp; let those be chosen that are worthy
&amp; it shall be manifest unto my servent
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] by the voice of the Spirit those
who are chosen &amp; they shall be sanct
ified &amp; in as much as they follow the cou
ncil which they receive they shall have
power after many days to accomplish
all things appertaining to Zion. And again
I say unto you sue for peace not own
ly the people that have smitten you but also
to all people &amp; lift up an ensign of peace
&amp; make a proclamation for peace unto
the ends of the earth &amp; make proposals for peace
unto those who have smitten youthat it may become fair as the Sun
&amp; clear as the Moon &amp; that her banne
rs may be terrible unto all nations
that the kingdoms of this world may
be constrained to acknowledge
that the kingdom of Zion is in very deed
the kingdom of our God &amp; his Christ
therefore let us become subject
unto her laws. Verily I say unto
you it is expedient in me that the first
Elders in My Church should recieve
their endowment from on high in
my [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|house]] which I have command
ed to be built unto my name in
the land of [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] &amp; let those
commandments which I have given
concerning Zion &amp; her law be execu-lands in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] that
can be purchased &amp; in the adjoining
counties round about for it is my
will that their lands should be purchased
&amp; after they are purchased that my Saints
possess them according to the law of
Consecration which I have given &amp;
after these lands are purchased I will
hold the armies of Israel guiltless in
taking possession of their own lands
&amp; of throwing down the towers of mine
enemies that may be upon them &amp; scatt-
ering their watchman &amp; avenging me
of mine enemies unto the third &amp; fourth
generation of them hate hate me. But
finally let my army become very
great &amp; let it be sanctified before meyou may rest in peace &amp; safety
whilst you are saying unto the people
execute judgment &amp; justice for us
according to law &amp; redress us of our
wrongs. Now behold I say unto you
my friends in this way you may find
favor in the eyes of the people unt-
ill the armies of Israel become
vary great &amp; I will soften the hearts
of the people as I did the heart of
Phariaoh from time to time untill
my servent [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] &amp; mine Elders
whom he shall appoint shall have time
to gather the strength of my house &amp;
to have some ^sent^ wise men to fulfill
that which I have communicated
concerning the purchesies of all thehave families in the East, let them
stay for a little season inasmuch as
my servent [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] shall appoint unto
them for I will council him conce-
rning this matter; and all things whatso-
ever he shall appoint unto them shall
be fulfilled &amp; let all my people who
dwell in the region round about be very
faithful &amp; prayerful &amp; humble before
me &amp; reveal not the things which
I have revealed unto them. Talk
not of judgment, boast not of faith,
nor of mighty works, but carefully
gather together as much in one region
as can be consistantly with the feeling
of the people. And behold I will give unto
you favor &amp; grace in their eyes, thatmy wariors my young men &amp; mid-
dle aged to gather together for the redemption
of my people &amp; throw down the towers of
mine enemies &amp; scatter th[e]ir watchmen
but the strength of mine house has
not harkened unto my words, but
inasmuch as their are those that have
harkened unto my words, I have
prepared a blessing &amp; an endowment
for them I have herd their prayers &amp;
will eccept their offering &amp; it is expe-
dient in me that they should be broug
ht thus far, for a trial of their
faith, &amp; verily I give unto you that
as many as have come up hither that
can stay in the regions round about let
them stay, &amp; those that cannot stay whoTherefore it is expedient in me that
mine Elders should weight for a little
season for the redemption of Zion
for behold I do not require at their
hands to fight the battles of Zion for
as I have said in a former commandm-
ent even so I will fulfill. I will fight
your battles; Behold the destroyer
I have already sent forth to destroy
&amp; lay waste mine enemies &amp; not
many years hence they shall not
be left to pollute mine heritage &amp;
to blaspheme my name upon the
land which I have consecrated for
the gathering to gether of my Saints. Behold
I have commanded my Servent [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]
to say to the strength of my house, even of the transgressions of my people it
is expedient in me that mine Elders
should weight for a little season for
the redemption of Zion that they them-
selves may be prepared &amp; that my
people may be taught more perfe-
ctly concerning their duty &amp; have
experience &amp; know more perfectly
concerning their duty &amp; the things
which I require at their hands &amp;
this cannot be brought to pass
untill mine Elders are endowed with
power from on High for behold I
have prepared a great endowment
&amp; blessing to be poured out upon
them inasmuch as they are faithf
ul, &amp; continue in humility before meAnd Zion cannot be built up
unless it is by the principles of the
Law of the Celestial Kingdom, otherwise
I cannot recieve her unto myself
and my people must needs be chastened
untill they become obedient if it
must needs be by the things which
they suffer, I speak not concern-
ing those who are appointed to lead my
people who are the first Elders of my
Church for they are not all under
condemnation but I speak con-
cerning the Church abroad. their are
many who will say whare is their God, behold
He will deliver in times of trouble otherw-
ise we will not go up unto Zion &amp; will
keep our monies. Therefore in consequenceRevelation given June 22, 1834, [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] Mo.

Verily I say unto you who have assembled
together that you may learn my will con-
cerning the redemption of Zion mine
afflicted people. Behold I say unto you,
were it not for the transgressions of my people
speaking concerning the Church &amp; not
individually they might have been redee-
med even now, but behold they have not
learned to be obedient to the things
which I require at there hands but
are full of all manner of evil and do
not impart of their substance as
becometh Saints, (to the poor &amp;
afflicted among them) and are not
united according to the union required
by the Law of the Celestial Kingdom.spirit of God will come to pass &amp; thus
by learning the spirit of God &amp; understanding
it you may grow into the principle of
revelation untill you become perfected
in Christ Jesus.

An Evangelist
Is a patriarch even the oldest man
of the Blood of Joseph or of the seed of
Abram wharever the Church of Christ
is esstablished in the earth there should
be a patriarch for the benefit of the
posterity of the Saints, as it was with
Jacob in given [giving] his patriarchal blessing
unto his sons &amp;c.he may have a perfect knowledge of the mys-
teries of the kingdom of God, &amp; this is the
state &amp; place where the ancient Saints arived
at when they saw such glorious visions, Isaiah
Ezekiel, John upon the Isle of Patmos, St
paul in the third heavens &amp; all the Saints who
held communion with the general
assembly &amp; church of the first born &amp;c.

The spirit of revelation is in connexion
with those blessings. A person may profit
by noticeing the first intimations of the spirit
of revelation for Instance when you feel
pure intelligence flowing unto you it
may give you sudden shak[e]s of Ideas
that by noticing it you may find it fulfi-
lled the same day or soon ie those things
that were presented unto your minds by thehis calling &amp; election made sure then
it will be his privilege to receive the other
Comforter which the Lord hath promised
the Saints as is recorded in the testimony of
St. John in the XIV ch from the 12 to the 27 vers
note the 16-17-18-21:23 verses. Now what is this
other Comforter it is no more or less
than the Lord Jesus Christ himself &amp;
this is the sum &amp; substance of the whole
matter that when any man obtains this
last Comforter he will have the personage
of Jesus Christ to attend him or appear unto
him from time to time &amp; even he will
manifest the father unto him &amp; they will
take up there abode with him &amp; the visions
of the heavens will be opened unto him &amp;
the Lord will teach him face to face &amp;Israelite while the Israelite at first
might be far before the gentile
in pure intelligence. The other com
forter spoken off is a subject of great
interest &amp; perhaps understood by few of
this generation. [ink change] After a person hath faith
in Christ, repents of his sins &amp; is baptized for
the remission of his sins &amp; receives the Holy
Ghost (by the laying on of hands,) which is the 
first comforter then let him continue
to humble himself before God hungering
&amp; thirsting after righteousness &amp; living by
every word of God, &amp; the Lord will soon
say unto him Son thou shalt be exalted,
&amp;c. When the Lord has thoroughly proved him
&amp; find that the man is determined to serve
him at all hazard then the man will findlitteral seed of Abram thhan one
that is a gentile though it may not
have half as much visible affect upon
the body for as the Holy Ghost falls up
on one of the literal seed of Abram it
is came [calm] &amp; serene &amp; his whole soul
&amp; and body ownly exercised by the pure
spirit of Intelligence. While the aff-
ect of the Holy Ghost upon a gentile is
to purge out the old blood &amp; make
him actually of the seed of Abram
That man that has none of tehe
Blood of Abram (naturally) must
have a new creation by the Holy Ghost
in such a case there may be mo
re of a powerful affect upon the body
&amp; visible to the eye than upon anto his neighbour know ye the
Lord for all shall know him (who
remain) from the least to the greatest
How is this to be done. it is to be done
by this sealing power &amp; the other comforter
spoken of which will be manifest by
revelation. There is two comforters
spoken of, the first comforter is the Holy
Ghost the same as given on the day of
pentecost &amp; that all Saints receive
after faith, repentance &amp; baptism.
This first comforter or Holy Ghost has
no other affect than pure intelligence
It is more powerful in expanding
the mind enlightening the understanding
&amp; storeing the intellect with present
knowledge of a man who is of theThe doctrin of the Resurrection of the
Dead and Eternal judgment are
necisary to preach among the first
principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The Doctrin of Election
St Paul exhorts us to make our calling
&amp; election shure. This is that Sealing
power spoken of by Paul in other places
see Ephe 1st 13â14 v that we may be sealed up
unto the day of redemption, this principle
ought (in its proper place) to be taught
for God hath not revealed any thing to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]
but what he will make known unto
the Twelve &amp; even the least saint
may know all things as fast as he is
able to bear them for the day must
come when no man need saycannot be recieved through the
medium of any other principle
than the principle of righteousness
for if the proposals are not complyied
with it is of no use but withdraws

Tongues
Were given for the purpose of preach-
ing among those whose language
is not understood as on the day of pen-
tecost &amp;c, &amp; it is not necessary for
tongues to be taught to the Church
particularly, for any man that
has the Holy Ghost can speak of the things
of God in his own tongue as well
as to speak in another. for faith
comes not by signs but by hearing
the word of God. [FIGURE]On the doctrin's of faith
Faith comes by hearing the word
of God through the testimony of the
Servents of God that Testimony is alw-
ays attended by the spirit of prophecy
&amp; revelation.

Repentance
Is a thing that cannot be trifled with
every day. Daily transgression &amp; daily
repentance is not that which is pleasing
in the sight of God [FIGURE]

Baptism
Is a Holy ordinance preparatory to
the reception of the Holy Ghost,; It is the
channel &amp; key by which the Holy Ghost
will be administered. The gift of the
Holy Ghost by the laying ofn of handsto apostacy &amp; if he does not repent will
apostitize as God live, the principle is as
correct as the one that Jesus put forth
in saying that that person he who seeketh
after a sign is an adulterous person
&amp; that principle is ^eternal^ undeviating &amp; firm
as the pillars of heaven for whenever you
see a man seeking after a sign you may 
set it down that he is an adulterous
man. [FIGURE] [illegible]

Other important items of doctrins from
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] given in [[Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois|Commerce]] Ill.

The pure testimony of the servents
of God in all ages of the world is
attended with the Spirit of Revelation
&amp; prophecy, or in other words faith
comes by hearing the word of God &amp; theany other that ever was or ever will be given
&amp; revealed unto man in this world or that
which is to come, yea in all your kicking
&amp; floundering see to it that you do not this
thing lest innocent blood be found in your
skirts &amp; you go down to hell. all
other sins are not to be compared to sinning
against the Holy Ghost &amp; poroving a traitor
to thy brethren (A final [FIGURE] key delivered
from [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] in the following language.) I will
give you one of the keys of the miysteries of
the kingdom. It is an eternal principle
that has existed with God for all eternity
that that man who rises up to condemn
others [ink blot] finding fault with the Church
saying that they are out of the way while
he himself is righteous, then know assur
edly that that man is in the high roadYe are not sent out to be taught but
to teach. let every word be seasoned with
grace be vigilent be sober, it is a day of
warning &amp; not of many words. act honest
before God &amp; man beware of gentile
sophestry such as bowing &amp; scraping unto
men in whom you have no confidence
be honest open &amp; frank in all your inter
course with mankind.

O ye Twelve &amp; all Saints profit by this im
portant Key [FIGURE] that in all your trials
troubles, temptations; afflictions, bonds,
imprisionments, &amp; death see to it that you
do not betray heaven, that you do not betray
Jesus Christ, that you do not betray your
Brethren, that you do not betray the revela
tions of God, whether in the Bible Book of
Mormon or Doctrins &amp; Covenants orWhen the Twelve or any other witnesses
stand before the congregations of the earth
&amp; they preach in the power &amp; demonstration
of the spirit of God &amp; the people are asstonis[h]ed
&amp; confounded at the doctrin &amp; say that
that man has preached a powerful discourse
a great sermon then let that man or
those men take care that they do not ass
cribe the glory unto themselves but be ca-
reful that they are humble &amp; ascribe the
praise &amp; glory to God &amp; the Lamb for
it is by the power of the Holy Priesthood
&amp; Holy Ghost they have power thus to speak:
what art thou O man but dust &amp; pain
wholm dost thou receive thy power &amp; blessings
but from God Then O ye Twelve notice
this [FIGURE] key &amp; be wise for Christ sake &amp; your
own so[u]ls sakehonourable mention of his name &amp; not
backbite &amp; devour our brother. Why [won't]
not man learn wisdom by precept of this 
late age of the world where we have such a
cloud of witnesses &amp; examples before us
&amp; not be obliged to learn by sad experi
ance every thing we know. must the new
ones that are chosen to fill the places
of those that our fallen of the quorum of the
Twelve begin to exalt themselves untill
they exhalt themselves so high that they will
even tumble over &amp; have a great fall
&amp; go wallowing through the mud &amp;
mire &amp; darkness Judas like to the
buffetings of Satan as several of the quor
um of the Twelve have done or will they
learn wisdom &amp; be wise. (O God give them
wisdom &amp; keep them humble I pray)The following important items &amp; plain
&amp; precious principles were delivered unto
the Twelve from [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] in [[Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory|Montrose]]
Ioway Territory July 1st 1839

Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy
&amp; be ready to forgive our brother on the first
intimations of repentance &amp; asking forgiveness,
&amp; should we ever forgive our brother or even
our enemy before they repent or ask forgiveness
our heavenly father would be equally as mercif-
ul unto us. Again let the Twelve &amp; all
Saints be willing to confess all their sins
&amp; not keep back a part &amp; let the twelve
be humble &amp; not be exalted &amp; beware of
pride &amp; not seek to excell one above another
but act for each others good &amp; pray for one &amp;
another &amp; honour oveur brother or makein the form of a personage unto man
&amp; reaches out his hand unto him &amp; the
man takes hold of his hand &amp; feels no
substance he may know it is Satan
for an angel of God (which is an angel
of light) is a Saint with his resurrected
body &amp; when he appears unto man
&amp; offers him his hand &amp; the man feels
a substance when he takes hold of it as
he would in shaking hands with his ne-
ighbour he may know it is a Angel
of God, &amp; should a Saint appear unto
man whose body is not resurrected he
will never offer him his hand for it
would be ^a^gainst the law by which they
are governed &amp; by observing this key we
may detect Satan [ink blot] that he decieve us
not [FIGURE]for verily I say unto you the keys of
the dispensation which ye have received
have come down from the fathers &amp;
last of all being sent down from heaven
unto you verily I say unto you
behold how great is your calling.
Clense your hearts &amp; your garments
lest the blood of this generation be req
uired at your hands. Be faithful
untill I come for I come quickly
&amp; my reward is with me to recompense
every man according as his work shall
be. I am Alpha and Omega Amen

[FIGURE] As there are many keys to the kingdom
of God the following one will detect Satan
when he transforms himself nigh unto
an angel of light. When Satan appearsnot yourselves concerning the affairs
of my church in this place saith the
Lord but purify your hearts before
me &amp; then go ye into all the world
&amp; preach my gospel unto every creat-
ure who have not recieved it &amp; he that
believeth &amp; is baptized shall be saved &amp;
he that believeth not &amp; is not baptized
shall be damned, for unto you
(the Twelve) &amp; those (the first presid-
ency) who are appointed with you to
be your councsillors and your
leaders is the power of this priesthood given
for the last days &amp; for the last time in the

times which power you hold in connection
with all those who have received a dispensation

inhabitants of the earth, a day of wrath

tion, as&amp; as a whilrlwind it shall come

my word. Whosoever recieveth my word
recieveth me &amp; whosoever recieveth me
recieveth those the first presidency whome
I have sent whome I have made counsellors
for my name sake unto you. and again
I say unto you that whosoever ye shall
send in my name by the voice of your
Brethren the Twelve duly recomme-
nded &amp; authorized by you shall have
power to open the door of my kingdom,
unto any nation whithersoever ye
shall send them inasmuch as they humble
themselves before me and abide in my words

verily I say unto you darkness coverethhim &amp; my hand shall be over him &amp;
the keys which I have given him &amp;
also to youward shall not be taken
from him untill I come. Verily
I say unto you, my servent [[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas]]
thou art the man whome I have chosen
to hold the keys of my kingdom as
pertaining to the Twelve abroad
among all Nations that thou mayest
be my servent to unlock the door of the
Kingdom in all places where my serva-
nt [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] &amp; my servant [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney]] and my
servant [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] cannot come for

all the Churches, for a little season
wherefore whithersoever they shall send
you go ye &amp; I will be with youand unto all who love my name and

About this time [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] arrived at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]],

[rest of page blank]to the pattern given by our beloved Savior Jesus
Christ, send greeting:

Dear Brethren:â
We have appointed our
beloved brother and companion in tribulation,
[[John Corrill|John Corrill]] to meet you in the name of the
Lord Jesus. He in connection with others duly
appointed also, will visit you alternately for
the purpose of instructing you in the necessary
qualifications of the Latter Day Saints: that
they may be perfected, that the officers and
members of the body of Christ may become
very prayerful and very faithful, strictly keep-
ing all the commandments and walking
in holiness before the Lord continually. That
all that mean to have the "destroyer pass
over them as the children of Israel and not
slay them," may live according to the "Word
of Wisdom&quot;; that the Saints by industry, dili-
gence and faithfulness and the prayer of faith,
may become purified, and enter upon their
inheritance to build up Zion according to the
word of the Lord.

We are sure if the Saints are very humble,
very watchful, and very prayerful, that few will
be deceived by those who have not authority
to teach, or who have not the spirit to teach[[Caleb Baldwin|Caleb Baldwin]], and [[Sylvester Hulet|Silvester Hulet]]; and Pres-
ident [[David Whitmer|David Whitmer]] gave the following decision
which was sanctioned by the Council.

According to testimony and the voice of the
Holy Spirit which is in us, we say unto you
that God in his infinite mercy doth yet grant
you a space for repentance, therefore if you
confess all the charges which have been alleged
against you, to be just and in a spirit that
we can receive it, then you can stand as
a private member in this Church; otherwise
we have no fellowship for you: and also that
the ordination of Sylvester Hulet by Samuel
Brown is illegal and not acknowledged by
us to be of God, therefore it is void and
of none effect.&quot; Brother Brown confessed the char-
ges and gave up his licences but retained his
membership. Council adjourned on the evening
of the first of August, but previous to adjourn-
ing the council gave the following letter to
the Elders appointed to visit the churches in
[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay Co.]] &amp;c.

To the Latter Day Saints who have been
driven from the land of their inheritance and
also those who are gathering in the regions
round about in the western boundaries of
[[Missouri|Missouri]], the High Council established accordinghold public meetings in that section of coun-
try as often as should be deemed necessary to
teach the disciples how to escape the indigna-
tion of their enemies and keep in favor with
those who were friendly disposed and Simeon
Carter, [[John Corrill|John Corrill]], [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]]
were appointed by the unanimous voice of the
Council and congregation to fill the mission.

Elder [[Nathan West|Nathan West]] preferred charges against
[[Samuel Brown|Samuel Brown]], High Priest, for teaching contrary
to counsel, namely; encouraging the brethren
in practicing gifts (speaking in tongues); in or-
daining [[Sylvester Hulet|Sylvester Hulet]], High Priest, (without coun-
sel) in a clandestine manner; asserting that
he had obtained a witness of the Lord which
was a promise of performing the same, in
receiving the gift of tongues, which gift he had
never before received, but afterwards said that
he had been in possession of that gift for the
space of a year; and in seeming to under-
value the authority or righteousness of the High
Council by charging Elder West not to say
anything that would tend to prejudice
their minds that they might not judge
righteously. These charges were sustained by the
testimony of [[Leonard Rich|Leonard Rich]], [[Charles English|Charles English]], Brother
Bruce, [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]], [[Hiram Page|Hiram Page]], [[Roxa Slade|Roxa Slade]]and heard the report of [[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]], Orson
Pratt, [[Zebedee Coltrin|Zebedee Coltrin]] and [[Isaac Morley|Isaac Morley]], concer-
ning the mission appointed them at the previous
council.

President [[David Whitmer|David Whitmer]] gave the council
some good instruction; that it was their duty
to transact all business in order, and when
any case is brought forward for investigation
every member should be attentive and patient to
what is passing in all cases and avoid con-
fusion and contention, which is offensive in the
sight of the Lord. He also addressed the Elders
and said that it is not pleasing in the sight
of the Lord for any man to go forth to preach
the gospel of peace unless he is qualified to set
forth its principles in plainness to those he en-
deavors to instruct, and also the rules and regu-
lations of the Church of Latter Day Saints: for
just as a man is and as he teaches and
acts, so will his followers be, let them be ever
so full of notions and whims. He also ad-
dressed the congregation and told them that
it was not wisdom for the brethren to vote at
the approaching election, and the Council ac-
quiesced in the instruction of the President.

[[William Wines Phelps|William W. Phelps]] proposed to the Council
to appoint a certain number of Elders toas soon as possible, that we may know whether
we can have the arms upon said order, or
not, also when. Send where we can receive them
and we will appoint an agent to receive and
receipt the same. Be assured that we do not
wish to obtain them from any hostile inten-
tions, but merely because the right of property
is ours. If I remember right, there is one gun
and a sword more then the order clalls for.

There followed a copy of the [[Daniel Dunklin|Governor's]] order,
similar to that of the Governor to Col. Lucas of the
2nd of May.

On the 12th, the High Council of Zion assembled
in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], and appointed Edward Part-
ridge, [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[Isaac Morley|Isaac Morley]], and Zebedee
Coltrin to visit the scattered and afflicted Breth-
ren in that region, and teach them the ways
of truth and holiness, and set them in order
according as the Lord should direct; but that
was not wisdom for the Elders generally to hold
public meetings in that region.

[rest of page blank]and for a living, as good and as great
as our venerable fathers had for indepen-
dence and liberty: that though the world has
been made to believe by false reports and
vague stories, that the Saints (called Mormons)
were meaner than the savages, still God has
been our help in time of trouble and has
provided for us in due season; and to use
the language of Pope, he has let the work
"Spread undivided" and "operate unspent."

For the honor of our beloved country and
the continuation of its free government, we appeal
for peace; for an example of forbearance, and
the diffusion of the everlasting Gospel, we appeal
to the humanity of all nations; and for the
glory of God, before whom we must all answer
for the deeds done in life, and for the hope
of holiness hereafter, we mean to remain faith-
ful to the end, continuing to pray to the Lord
to spare us and the people from whatever is
evil and not calculated to humble us, and
prepare us for His presence and glory: at the
same time beseeching Him in the name of
Jesus to extend His blessings to whom he will,
and his mercy to all, till, by righteousness
the kingdoms of this world become fair as
the sun and clear as the moon. (over)pure hear ye him!

While we ask peace and protection for the
Saints, wherever they may be, we also solicit
the charity and benevolence of all the worthy
on earth, to purchase the righteous a holy
home, a place of rest and a land of peace,
believing that no man who knows he has
a soul will keep back his mite, but cast it in
for the benefit of Zion; thus when time is no
longer, he with all the ransomed of the Lord
may stand in the fulness of joy, and view
the grand pillar of Heaven, which was built
by the faith and charity of the Saints, beginning
at Adam with this motto in the base "Repent 
and live" surrounded with a beautiful circle
sign supported by a cross, about midway up
its lofty column, staring the world in letters of
blood "The Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand" and finished
with a plain top, towering up in the midst
of the celestial world, around which is written
by the finger of Jehovah: &quot;Eternal Life is the great-
est gift of God."

Although we may fail to show all men
the truth of the fulness of the Gospel, yet we
hope to be able to convince some that we are
neither deluded nor fanatics, but like other
men have a claim on the world for landfrom God, and while every event that transpires
around us, in evidence of the truth of them,
and an index that the great and terrible day
of the Lord is near, we intreat the philanthro-
pist, the moralist and the honorable men of
all creeds, and sects, to read our publications,
to examine the Bible, the Book of Mormon and
the Commandments, and listen to the fulness
of the gospel, and judge whether we are enti-
tled to the credit of the world, for honest motives
and true principles.

A cloud of bad omen seems to hang
over this generation. Men start up at the im-
pulse of the moment and defy and outstrip all
law, while the destroyer is also abroad in the
earth wasting flesh without measure and
none can stay his course. In the midst
of such portentious times, we feel an anxious
desire to prepare, and help others prepare for
coming events; and we candidly believe
that no honest man will put forth his
hand to stop the work of the Lord, or persecute
the Saints.

In the name of Jesus, we entreat the peo-
ple of this nation to pause before they reject
the words of the Lord, or his servants: These,
like all flesh, may be imperfect "But God isbe seen in the 18th chapter of Isaiah: "The present
should be brough[t] unto the Lord of Hosts of a 
people scattered and peeled and from a people
terrible from their beginning hitherto; - - - - - - a
nation meeted out and trodden under foot;
whose land the rivers have spoiled;, to the peace
of the name of the Lord of Hosts the Mount
Zion." And how few have come forth rejoicing
that the hour of redemption! and some that
came have turned away, which may cause
thousands to exclaim amid the general confu-
sion and fright of the times, "Remember Lot's
Wife."

It would be a work of supercerogation to
labor to show the truth of the gathering of the
Children of Israel in these last days: For the
prophet told us long ago that it should no
more be said, "The Lord liveth that brought up
the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt,
but the Lord liveth that brought up the Chil-
dren of Israel from the land of the north
and from all the lands whither he had
driven them;&quot; and so it must be for the hon-
or and glory of God.

The faith and religion of the Latter-Day
Saints, are founded upon the old Scriptures,
the Book of Mormon, and direct revelationSt. Mathew: &quot;Go ye therefore and teach all na-
tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father
and of the Suon and of the Holy Ghost, teach-
ing them to observe all things whatsoever I have
commanded you: and lo I am with you
always, even unto the end of the world."

Thus we shall send laborers into the Lord's
vineyard to gather wheat and prepare the earth
against the day when desolation shall be
poured out without measure; and as it now
is and ever has been considered one of the
most honorable and glorious employments of
men to carry good tidings to the nations,
so we shall expect the clemency of all men,
while we go forth for the last time to gather
Israel for the glory of God, that he may
suddenly come to his temple; that all na-
tions may come and worship in his pres-
ence, when there shall be none to molest or
make afraid, but the earth shall be filled
with his knowledge and glory. We live in
an age of fearful imagination, with all the
sincerity that common men are endowed with,
the Saints have labored without pay to instruct
the United States that the gathering had
commenced in the western boundaries of
[[Missouri|Missouri]], to build a holy city, where, as maymore fully satisfy the world that our object
is peace and good will to all mankind, we
hereby appeal for peace to the ends of the earth,
and ask the protection of all people while we
use every fair means in our power to obtain
our rights and immunities without force; set-
ting an example for all true believers that we
will not yield our faith and principles, for
any earthly considerations whereby a precedent
might be established, that a majority may
crush any religious sect with impunity; know-
ing that if we give up our rights in Jackson
County, farewell to society! farewell to religion!
farewell to right! farewell to property! farewell to
life! the fate of our church now, might become
the fate of the Methodist next week, the Catholics
next month, and the overthrow of all societies
next year; leaving nation after nation a wide
waste where reason and friendship once were!
Another and the great object which we mean
to help accomplish is the salvation of the
souls of men; and to bring to pass such a
glorious work, like many other religious denomi-
nations in all ages, we shall license Elders
to preach the everlasting Gospel to all nations
according to the great commandment of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, as recorded inJuly 1834.

hands of our venerable fathers, to us, but they
will also protect us from insult and injury,
and aid the work of God, that they may
reap a reward in the regions of bliss, when
all men receive according to their works.

In relation to our distress, from the want
of our lands in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], and for the
want of the property destroyed by fire and waste,
rather than do any act contrary to law, we
solemnly appeal to the people with whom we
tarry, for protection from insult and harm;, and
for the comforts of life by labor, or otherwise, while
we seek peace and satisfaction of our enemies
through every possible and honorable means
which humanity can dictate or philanthrophy
urge, or religion require.

We are citizens of this republic, and we ask
our rights as republicans, not merely in our
restoration to our lands and property in Jackson
County, Missouri, but it being considered honest in
our faith, honest in our deal, and honest before
God, till by due course of law. We may be proved
otherwise, reserving the right of every man&apos;s be-
ing held amenable to the proper authority for
his own crimes and sins.

&quot;Crowns won by blood, by blood must be main-
tained," and to avoid blood and strife, andNow we seek peace, and ask our rights
even regress and redemption at the hands of
the rulers of this nation; not only our lands
and property in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] but for free
trade with all men and unmolested emigra-
tion to any part of the Union, and for our
inherent right to worship God as we please.

We ask the rights because they have been
taken from us, or abridged by the violence and
usurpation of the inhabitants of Jackson County.
As a people we hold ourselves amenable to
the laws of the land, and while the government
remains as it is, the right to emigrate from
State to State: from Territory to Territory: from
county to county, and from vicinity to vicinity,
is open to all men of whatsoever trade or creed,
without hindrance or molestation; and as
long as we are justifiable and honest in the
eyes of the law, we claim it, whether we remove
by single families or in bodies of hundreds, with
that of carrying the necessary arms and accou-
trements for military duty; and we believe
that all honest men who love their country
and their country's glory and have a wish to
see the law magnified and made honorable,
will not only help perpetuate the great legacy
of freedom that came unimparired from thethe last days, for the salvation and gathering
of Israel.

Let no man be alarmed because our soci-
ety has commenced gathering to build a city
and a house for the Lord as a refuge from
present evils and coming calamities. Our fore-
fathers came to the goodly land of America
to shun persecution and enjory their religious
opinions and rights as they thought proper;
and the Lord after much tribulation blessed
them and has said that we should continue
to importune for redress and redemption by the
hands of those who are placed as ruler and
are in authority over us, according to the laws
and constitution of the people, which he has suf-
fered to be establish and should be maintain-
ed for the rights and protection of all flesh
according to just and holy principles; that
every man act in doctrine and in principle
pertaining to futurity according to the moral
agency which  the has given unto them; that
every man may be accountable for his own
sins in the day of Judgment; and for this
purpose he has established the constitution of
this land by the hands of wise men whom he
raised up unto this very purpose, and re-
deemed the land by the shedding of blood.the friends of humanity and justice in every
clime and country on the globe.

By the desperate acts of the inhabitants of
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], many hundreds of American
Citizens are deprived of their lands and rights; and
it is reported that we mean to regain our posses-
sions, and even Jackson County "by the shedding of
blood"; but if any man will take the pains to
read the 1353rd page of the Book of Commandments
he will find it there said, "Wherefore the land of
Zion shall not be obtained but by purchase, or by
blood, otherwise there is none inheritance for you.
And if by purchase behold you are blessed; and
if by blood, as you are forbidden to shed blood lo! your
enemies are upon you and you shall be scourged
from city to city and from synagogue to syna-
gogue, and but few shall stand to receive an
inheritance." So we declare that we have even
meant, and now mean to purchase the land
of our inheritance like all other honest men
of the government and of those who would
rather sell their farms than live in our society.
And as thousands have done before us, we
solicit the aid of the children of men, and
of government to help us obtain our rights in
Jackson County and the land whereon the Zion
of God, according to our faith, shall stand inis good, for the good of all, we come before the
great family of mankind for peace and ask
their hospitality and assistance for our comfort
and the preservation of our persons and property,
and solicit their charity for the great cause
of gGod. We are well aware that many slan-
derous reports and ridiculous stories are in cir-
culation against our religion and society, but
as wise men will hear both sides, and then
judge, we sincerely hope and trust that the
still, small voice of truth, will be heard and our
great revelations read and candidly compared
with the prophecies of the Bible, that the great
cause of our redeemer may be supported by
a liberal share of public opinion as well as the
unseen power of God. It will be seen by a
reference to the Book of Commandments, page
135, that the Lord has said to the Church, and
we meant to live by his words, "Let no man
break the law of the land, for he that keepeth the
Laws of God, hath no need to break the laws
of the land;" therefore as the people of God, we come
before the world and claim protection by law from
the common officers of justice in every neighborhood
where our people may be; we claim the same
at the hands of the governors of the several States
and of the President of the United States, and ofthings there has been a type." In fact, all
the prophets from Moses to John the Revelator,
have spoken concerning these things, and
in all good faith, by direct revelation from
the Lord, as in days of old, we commenced
the glorious work, that a holy city â a new
Jerusalem, even Zion might be built up, and
a temple reared in this generation, where-
unto, as saith the Lord, all nations should be
invited. Firstly the rich and the learned, the
wise and the noble; and after that cometh
the day of his power. But the inhabitants of
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] arrayed themselves against
us because of our faith and belief and des-
troyed our printing establishment, to prevent
the spread of the work, and drove men wom-
en and children from their lands, houses
and homes, to perish in the approaching
winter, while every blast carried the wailings
of women and the shrieks of children across
the wide spread prairie, sufficiently horrible
to draw tears from the savage or melt a heart
of stone!

Now that the world may know that our
faith in the work and word of the Lord is
firm and unshaken, and to show all nations,
kindreds, tongues and people that our objectpleased, that we should be protected, not only
by all the laws of a free Republic, but by
every republican throughout the realms of
freedom.

The holy prophets had declared, "That it
should come to pass in the last days that
the mountain of the Lord's House should be
established in the top of the mountains and
should be exalted above the hills, and all na-
tions should flow unto it. And many people
should go and say, come ye and let us go
up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house
of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of
his ways and we will walk in his paths;
for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and
the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." And
again it was said by Joel seemingly to
strengthen the faith of the Latter-Day Saints
in the above "That whosoever should call non
the name of the Lord, should be delivered, for
in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be de-
liverance as the Lord hath said, and in the
remnant whom the Lord shall call." The
Book of Mormon which we hold equally sa-
cred with the Bible, says &quot;That a new Jerusa-
lem shall be built upon this land unto the
remnant of the seed of Joseph, for the whichcompels us to complain to the world. And if
our cause and calamity are not sufficient to
excite the commisseration of the humane, and
open the hearts of the generous, and fire the
spirits of the patriotic, then has sympathy
lost herself in the wilderness and justice fled
from power; then has the dignity of the ermine
shrunk at the gigantic front of a mob, and
the sacred mantle of freedom been caught up
to Heaven where the weary are at rest and the
wicked cannot come.

To be obedient to the commandments of our
Lord and Savior, some of the leaders of the
Church commenced purchasing lands in the
western boundaries of the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]] ac-
cording to the revelations of God, for the city of
Zion: in doing which no law was evaded,
no rights infringed nor no principle of reli-
gion neglected but the laudable foundation of
a glorious work begun for the salvation of
mankind in the last days agreeable to our
faith and according to the promises in the
sacred Scriptures of God.

We verily bielieve, knowing that the Nation-
al and State Constitutions, and the statute
laws of the land and the commandments
of the Lord allowed all men to worship as theyto lay our case before the world to be weighed
in the balances of public opinion.

Now, therefore, as citizens of the United
States and leading Elders in the Church of
the Latter-Day Saints residing in the state
of [[Missouri|Missouri]], in behalf of the Church we the
undersigned do make this solemn appeal
to the people and constituted authorities of
this nation and to the ends of the earth,
for Peace; that we may have the privilege
of enjoying our religious rights and immu-
nities and worship God according to the
dictates of our own consciences as guaran-
teed to every citizen by the constitutions of the
national and State governments. That although
the laws have been broken arend are defied
in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], we may be enabled to re-
gain and enjoy our rights and property agree-
able to law in this boasted land of liberty.

Since the disgraceful combination of the
inhabitants of Jackson County has set the
law at defiance and put all hopes of
criminal prosecution against them in that
vicinage beyond the reach of judge and
jury, and left us but a distant expectation
of civil remuneration for the great amount
of damage we have sustained, necessitynot withstanding they offered double price for our
lands, in thirty days, or sell theirs at the
same rate; for this plain reason that the
whole large county of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]] would be as
thirty to one, or nearly so, in comparison with
the matter in question and in supposition, for
one thousand dollars, two thousand dollars
to our people, was asking for three hundred
thousand dollars, the exhorbitant sum of six
hundred thousand dollars, taking the land
rich and poor, in thirty days! with the reproach-
able, vicious, unamerican and unconstitutional
proviso that the committee on our part bind
themselves "That no Mormon should ever settle
in Jackson County": and whereas our committee
proposed to the said Jackson Committee (if they
would not grant us our rights otherwise) that
our people would buy the land of those that
were unwilling to live among our people in
that county, and pay them in one year; they
allowing the damage we have sustained in
the loss of a printing office, apparatus and
book work, houses, property, &amp;c to come out of
the purchase money, but no answer returned:
and whereas to show our honest intentions
and awaken the friends of virtue, human-
ity and equal rights, it becomes our dutythemselves for military duty and self defence,
seeing their arms taken from them by the in-
habitants of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] were purposely kept
from them; and whereas a number of the
members of the Church in the east have emi-
grated to this region of country to settle and
join their Brethren, with arms to answer the
military law, which has created some excite-
ment among the inhabitants of the upper
counties of this [[Missouri|State]], whereupon to show that
our object was only the peaceable possession of
our rights and property, and to purchase
more land in the regions round about, we met
a committee from Jackson County for compromise;
and our emigrating brethren met some gentle-
men from [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]] and other counties to satisfy
them that their motives were good and their
object peace, which they did. and whereas the
propositions of the Jackson Committee could not
be accepted on our part because they proposed
to "buy or sell" and to sell our land would
amount to a denial of our faith, as that
land is the place where the Zion of God shall
stand according to our faith and belief in
the revelations of God, and upon which Is-
rael shall be gathered according to the Prophets:
and secondly the propositions were unfairwhere it was caluculated to purchase of those
who were unwilling to reside with the Church
as a society, all lands that could be bought for
the purpose of building up a holy city unto God,
a New Jerusalem â a place which we were desirous
to call Zion, as we believe a place of refuge
from the scourge and plagues which are so
often mentioned in the Bible by the prophets
and apostles, that should be poured out upon
the earth in the last days; and whereas the
inhabitants of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], Missouri, have
leagued and combined against said church,
and have driven the Saints from their lands,
and taken their arms from them, and burn-
ed down many of their houses without any
provocation; and whereas we have petitioned
the [[Daniel Dunklin|Governor]] of this [[Missouri|State]], and the President
of the United States for the redress of wrongs,
(the law being put at defiance in Jackson Coun-
ty) and for redemption of rights, that we
might be legally repossessed of our lands and
property: and whereas the said inhabitants of
Jackson County, have not only bound them-
selves to keep us out of that county, but have
armed themselves cap a pie and even with can-
non for war: and whereas our people resi-
ding in the upper Missouri, have recently armed[[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] as assistant presidents or coun-
sellors, and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|myself]] as first President of the
Church; and to uphold one another by faith
and prayer.

Previous to entering into this covenant, and
in pursuance of the revelation to the Saints to
sue for, and proclaim peace to the ends of the
earth, the following appeal was written and san-
ctioned by the High Council and first Presiden-
cy of the Church at the foregoing sitting. Presi-
dent [[David Whitmer|Whitmer]] closed the Council by prayer. F.
G. Williams was clerk.

An Appeal.

Whereas the Church of Christ, recently styled the
Church - - - - - of the Latter-Day Saints con-
tumeliously called "Mormons" or "Mormonites" has
suffered many privations, afflictions, persecutions
and losses on account of the religious belief and
faith of its members, which belief and faith
are founded in the revealed word of God, as
recorded in the holy Bible, or the Book of Mormon,
the revelations and commandments of our
Savior Jesus Christ; and whereas the said church
by revelation commenced removing to the wes-
tern boundaries of the State of [[Missouri|Missouri]], where
lands were purchased of the government, andChurch. After hearing the pleas, the President
decided that it was the duty of [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] to
go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] to assist in printing and that
his family remain in the region where they were,
and that he have an honorable discharge from
his station in Zion for a season. (as soon as he
can accomplish his business) signed by the Pres-
ident and Clerk.

It was then proposed by W. W. Phelps that
[[David Whitmer|David Whitmer]], the President of the Church in Zion,
should go to Kirtland and assist in promoting
the cause of Christ, as being one of the three Wit-
nesses. This case was argued by [[Levi Jackman|Levi Jackman]]
and [[Christian Whitmer|Christian Whitmer]] in behalf of the plain-
tiff, and [[Solomon Hancock|Solomon Hancock]] and [[Newel Knight|Newel Knight]]
for the Church; after which it was decided, as
before, that Brother David Whitmer go to the
East and assist in the great work of the gath-
ering, and be his own judge as to leaving
his family or taking them with him. It was
also decided that [[John Whitmer|John Whitmer]] and William
E. McLellin go east as soon as convenient. The
High Priests, Elders, Priests, Teachers, Deacons and
members present then covenanted with hands
uplifted to Heaven, that they would uphold
Brother David Whitmer as President in Zion
in [[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]] absence, and John Whitmer andwhich resulted as follows, namely:
[[Simeon Dagget Carter|Simeon Carter]] No. 1 [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] No. 2
[[William Earl McLellin|William McLellin]] " 3 [[Calvin Bebe|Calvin Beebe]] " 4
[[Levi Jackman|Levi Jackman]] " 5 [[Solomon Hancock|Solomon Hancock]] " 6
[[Christian Whitmer|Christian Whitmer]] " 7 [[Newel Knight|Newel Knight]] " 8
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] " 9 [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] " 10
[[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B. Marsh]] " 11 [[John M. Murdock|John Murdock]] " 12

Father [[Peter Whitmer Sr.|Whitmer]] came forward and blessed
his three sons, namely: [[David Whitmer|David]], [[John Whitmer|John]] and Cristian
Whitmer in the name of the Lord. Also Father
[[Joseph Knight Sr.|Knight]] blessed his son Newel. Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]]
stated to the council, that a greater responsibi-
lity rested upon him than before their organi-
zation, as it was not his privilege to counsel
with any of them except the council and his
own counsellors, and desired their prayers
that he might be enabled to act in righteous-
ness. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] next presented the case of [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]]
to the Council to have their decision whether
he should take his family to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], and
if so, when he shall start, as it had been
deemed necessary for him to assist in the prin-
ting establishment. It was motioned and
carried that four of the counsellors speak on
the subject, two on each side, namely; Sime-
on Carter and William E. McLellin for the Plain-
tiff; and Parley Pratt and Calvin Beebe for thewho had traveled in the Camp with [[Joseph Smith Jr.|me]], and
such others as desired information, until the
7th when the Council assembled according to ad-
journment at the house of Elder [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]],
present fifteen High Priests, eight elders, four Priests,
eight Teachers, three deacons and - - members.
After singing and prayer, I gave the Council
such instructions in relation to their high cal-
ling, as would enable them to proceed to min-
ister in their office, agreeable to the pattern here-
tofore given; read the revelation on the subject,
and told them that if I should now be taken
away, I had accomplished the great work
the Lord had laid upon me, and that which
I had desired of the Lord; and that I had
done my duty in organizing the High Council,
through which council the will of the Lord might
be known on all important occasions, in the
building up of Zion, and establishing truth in
the earth.

It was voted that those who were appoin-
ted on the third, should be confirmed in their
appointments. I then ordained [[David Whitmer|David Whitmer]]
President, and [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] and [[John Whitmer|John Whitmer]]
assistants; and their twelve counsellors. The twelve
counselors then proceeded to cast lots to know
who should speak first, and the order of speakingTo [[John Lincoln|John Lincoln]], [[George R. Morehead|Geo. R. Morehead]] }

July 3, 1834 ~ Thursday


On the 3rd of July the High Priests of Zion
assembled in the yard of Colonel Arthur's where
[[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] lived, in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] pro-
ceeded to organize a High Council agreeable to
the revelation and pattern given at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]],
for the purpose of settling important business
that might come before them, which could
not be settled by the Bishop and his council.

[[David Whitmer|David Whitmer]] was elected President and William
W. Phelps and [[John Whitmer|John Whitmer]] assistant presidents.

The following High Priests namely, Christian
Whitmer, [[Newel Knight|Newel Knight]], [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], Calvin
Beebe, [[William Earl McLellin|William E. McLellin]], [[Solomon Hancock|Solomon Hancock]],
[[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B. Marsh]], [[Simeon Dagget Carter|Simeon Carter]], [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]],
[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[John M. Murdock|John Murdock]] and [[Levi Jackman|Levi Jackman]]
were appointed counsellors and the Council ad-
journed to Monday. [[Frederick Granger Williams|Frederick G. Williams]] was
clerk of the meeting.

I authorized General Lyman Wight to give
a discharge to every man of the camp who
had proved himself faithful, certifying that
fact, and giving him leave to return home.

From this time I continued to give instructions
to the members of the High Council, Elders, thosethe Mormons shall enter that [[Jackson County, Missouri|county]] to re-
side until the money is paid. The damages
that we have sustained in consequence
of being driven away, shall also be left to
the above twelve men; or they may all live
in the county if they choose and we will
never molest them if they will let us alone
and permit us to enjoy our rights. We want
to live in peace with all men; and equal
rights is all we ask. We wish to become
permanent citizens of this [[Missouri|state]] and wish to
bear our proportion in support of the govern-
ment and to be protected by its laws. If the
above propositions are complied with, we are
willing to give security on our part; and
we shall want the same of the people of
Jackson County for the performance of this
agreement. We do not wish to settle down in
a body except where we can purchase the
lands with money; for to take possession by
conquest, or the shedding of blood, is entirely
foreign to our feelings. The shedding of blood
we shall not be guilty of until all just
and honorable means among men prove
insufficient to restore peace. (Signed) Joseph Smith
Jr. [[Frederick Granger Williams|F. G. Williams]], [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]], [[Roger Orton|Roger Orton]],
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]], [[John Sims Carter|John S. Carter]], June 21st
(over)declaration of our intentions from under our
own hands will show are not correct.

In the first place it is not our intention
to commit hostilities against any man or
set of men. It is not our intention to in-
jure any mans person or property except
in defending ourselves. Our flag has been
exhibited to the above gentlemen who will be
able to describe it. Our men were not taken
from any manufacturing establishment. It
is our intention go back upon our Lands
in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] by order of the Executive of
the [[Missouri|State]], if possible. We have brought our
arms with us for the purpose of self defence, as
it is well known to almost every man of
the State that we have every reason to put
ourselves in an attitude of defence, consider-
ing the abuse we have suffered in Jackson
County. We are anxious for a settlement
of the difficulties existing between us upon hon-
orable and Constitutional principles.

We are willing for twelve disinterested
men, six to be chosen by each party, and
these men shall say what the possessions
of those men are worth who cannot live
with us in the County; and they shall have
their money in one year; and none ofPropositions &amp;c of the Mormons.

Being called upon by the above named
gentlemen at our camp in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] to
ascertain from the leaders of our men, our
intentions, views and designs in approaching
this county in the manner that we have; we
therefore the more cheerfully comply with their
request because we are called upon by gentle-
men of good feelings and who are disposed
for peace and an amicable adjustment of
the difficulties existing between us and the
people of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]. The reports of our
intentions are various and have gone abroad
in a light calculated to arouse the feelings
of almost every man. For instance, one re-
port is that we intend to demolish the prin-
ting office in [[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]]: another report is that
we intend crossing the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] on Sun-
day next, and falling upon women and
children and slaying them: another is
that our men were employed to perform
this expedition being taken from manufac-
turing establishments in the East that had
closed business: another^lso^ that we carried a
flag bearing peace on one side and war or
blood on the other: and various others too nu-
merous to mention, all of which a plaincovenanted with uplifted hands to Heaven
that they would humble themselves the Lord
and keep his commandments and obey the
counsel of the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]], the power of God rested
upon them and we were all bathed in tears.
There was not another case of cholera among
the saints from that hour."

This day the &quot;Enquirer&quot; published the cor-
respondence between the Sheriff and the Camp,
of the 22nd of June, as follows:

"Being a citizen of [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] and knowing
that there is considerable excitement amongst
the people thereof; and also knowing that
different reports are arriving almost hourly,
and being requested by the Hon. [[John F. Ryland|J. F. Ryland]]
to meet the Mormons under arms, and ob-
tain from the leaders thereof the correctness of
the various reports in circulation, the true in-
tent and meaning of their present movemen-
ts, and their views generally regarding the
difficulties existing between them and Jackson
County, I did in company with other gentle-
men call upon the said leaders of the
Mormons at their camp in Clay County,âand
now give to the people of Clay County their
written statement containing the substance of
what passed between us. (Signed) [[Cornelius Gilliam|Cornelius Gillium]].ed and was immediately mounted on a 
hard riding horse, rode 15 miles and came
to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|me]].

The last days of June I spent with my
old [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] friends in the western part
of [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]].
July 1, 1834 ~ Tuesday


On the first of July [[Jesse Johnson Smith|Jesse J. Smith]] died. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]]
crossed the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] in company with a 
few friends into Jackson County, to set my
feet once more on the "goodly land;" and on
the 2nd I went down near [[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]] and visited
the brethren. A considerable number of the
camp met me at [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight's]]. I told
them if they would humble themselves before
the Lord and covenant to keep His command-
ments, and obey my counsel, the plague should
be stayed from that hour and there should
not be another case of the cholera among
them. The brethren covenanted to that effect
and the plague was stayed. W. Woodruff
says, I was present at the meeting of Joseph
with his brethren at Lyman Wights and the
Prophet seemed more bowed down with sorrow
at the loss of his brethren than I ever saw
him in my life. At the same time he
was clothed with the Spirit of God and
with humility; and when all the Brethrenor pouring it upon them, and giving
them whiskey thickened with flour to the
consistence of starch. (Whiskey was the only
kind of spirits that could be procured at
this place). About sixty-eight of the saints
suffered from this disease, of which number
fourteen died, viz: [[John Sims Carter|John S. Carter]], [[Eber Wilcox|Eber Wilcox]],
[[Seth Hitchcock|Seth Hitchcock]], [[Erastus Rudd|Erastus Rudd]], Algernon Sidney
Gilbert, [[Alfred Fisk|Alfred]] Jesse J. Smith, Warren Ingalls
Fisk, [[Edward Ives|Edward Ives]], [[Noah Johnson|Noah Johnson]], Jesse B. Law-
son, [[Robert McCord|Robert McDord]], [[Elial Strong|Elial Strong]], [[Jesse Johnson Smith|Jesse J. Smith]],
[[Warren Ingles|Warren Ingalls]] and [[Elizabeth Patten Parrish|Betsey Parrish]]. Among the
most active of those that were engaged in
taking care of the sick at the camp, burying
the dead, &amp;c were [[John D. Parker|John D. Parker]], [[John Tanner|John Tanner]],
[[Nathan Tanner|Nathan Tanner]], [[Joseph Bates Noble|Joseph B. Nobles]], [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]],
[[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]], [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimball]], [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]],
and [[Eleazer Miller|Eleazer Miller]].

[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] sent [[Hiram Page|Hiram Page]] with instructions to bring
Jesse J. Smith and [[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]] to me at all
hazards to the west part of the country, having
had intimations that they were sick, he found
that Jesse had been severely racked with the
cholera all day, Geo. A. Smith had taken care
of him for upwards of thirty hours. Dr. Wil-
liams decided that the cholera had left him
and would recover if not moved, on the
morning of the 28th, Geo. A. Smith was attack-Lord's Store-House, [[Algernon Sidney Gilbert|Algernon S. Gilbert]], for he
was attacked with the cholera the same day
and died about the 29th, according to his
own words, that he would rather die, than
go forth to preach the gospel to the gentiles.

The following is from the chairman of
the committee of the [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]] Mob to our Lawyer.

[[Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Independence]], Mo. June 26th, 1834.

Mr. [[Amos Rees|Amos Rees]]â Dear Sir:â
Since my return
from [[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]], I have been busily engaged
in conversing with the most influential men
of our county endeavoring to find out if
possible what kind of a compromise will
suit with the Mormons on their part. The people
here en masse I find out will do nothing
like acceeding to their last proposition. We will
have a meeting if possible on Monday next,
at which time the proposals of the Mormons
will be answered. In the mean time, I would
be glad that they, the Mormons would cast an
eye back of Clinton and see if that is not a 
country calculated for them. Yours Respectfully,
[[Samuel C. Owens|S. C. Owens]].

The cholera continued its ravages about
four days when a remedy for purging, vom-
iting and cramping was discovered; name-
ly: dipping the person afflicted in cold water[[Daniel Dunklin|Your]] second order for the restoration of
our arms was received last mail; we have
not yet done any thing with it. Hoping
that the influence of the inhabitants of Jack-
son County will materially lessen in the
surrounding counties and the pepoople be-
come more tranquil, we think it wisdom
to defer petitioning for a guard while
there exists a hope of a compromise, &amp;c.

We believe that the President would ren-
der us assistance in obtaining possession of
our lands if aided by the executive of this
[[Missouri|Stakte]] in a petition, and thereby put an
end to serious evils that are growing
out of the Jackson outrage. In a letter from
your Excellency of April 20th, we had a word
on the subject of petitioning.

We should be pleased to hear further, and
would here observe that no communication
from the Executive, giving his opinion or ad-
vice, will be made public if requested not to
do so. We are Respectfully and with great
regard your Obt. Servants,

[[Algernon Sidney Gilbert|A. S. Gilbert]],
[[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]].
[[John Corrill|John Corrill]].

The drafting and signing of the above
was the last public act of that keeper of thenanbrethren in this county have been forci-
bly entered by some of the inhabitants
of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]], and a number of guns
and small arms taken therefrom. Where
the men were absent from their houses,
loaded guns were presented to the fe-
males, and their lives threatened if they
made resistance, and ^as^ we have been
informed, and have no doubt of the
fact.
[rest of page blank]ceived from [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]].

If we fail in this attempt, we
intend to make another effort and go
all lengths that would be required by
human or divine law. As our propo-
sals and correspondence with the inha-
bitants of Jackson, will doubtless hereafter
be published, we think it unnecessary to
detail the same in this communication.
Our right to our soil in Jackson County
we shall forever claim, and to obtain
peaceful possession we are willing to
make great sacrifices. To allay excite-
ment in the county, the aforesaid com-
pany of emigrants have dispersed to
await the final end of all negotia-
tions that can be made with the said
county of Jackson.

Within the last week one of our
men being near the ferry, was seized
by some Jackson citizens, while in this
county, threatened with death if he
made resistance, and carried over the
river, prisoner to [[Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Independence]], where
he was put under guard one day,
and after hearing many threats, was
liberated. The houses of several of ourpossess humane and republican feelings,
our people were rejoiced at the opportu-
nity of an interchange of feelings, and
an open and frank avowal of all
their views and intentions in emigra-
ting to this country with their arms. A
full explanation having been given in a
public address by our brother Joseph Smith
Jr., which produced great satisfaction, the
same in substance was afterwards re-
duced in writing, and handed to the
aforesaid gentlemen, that it might be
made public, as the shedding of blood
is, and ever has been, foreign and
revolting to our feelings. For this reason,
we have patiently endured the greatest
indignities that freemen of this republic
have ever been called to suffer; and
we still continue to bear with heart-rend-
ings a deprivation of our rights, have
commenced negociations with the inhab-
itants of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]] for a compromise; where-
in proposals on our part have been
made, which have been acknowledged
by every disinterested man to be highly
honorable and liberal. An answer to
our propositions has not yet been re-attacked with the cholera.

As it was impossible to obtain cof-
fins, the brethren rolled the corpses in
blankets, carried them on a horse-sled
about half a mile, burrid them in the
bank of a small stream which empties
into [[Rush Creek, Clay County, Missouri|Rush Creek]], all of which was
accomplished by dark. When they had
returned from the burial, the brethren
united, covenanted and prayed, hop-
ing the disease would be staid; but
in vain, for while thus covenanting, Eber
Wilcox died; and while some were dig-
ging the grave, others stood sentry with
their fire arms, watching their enemies.

[[Daniel Dunklin|Dunklin]] as follows:â

Sir,â
A company of our people
exceeding two hundred men arrived in this
county the 19th inst. and encamped about
twelve miles from [[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]], where they were
met by several gentlemen from this and
[[Ray County, Missouri|Ray County]], who went by request of the
people to ascertain the motives and de-
signs of our people in approaching this
county; and as the deputation was com-
posed of gentlemen who appeared to[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] left [[Rush Creek, Clay County, Missouri|Rush Creek]] in company with
[[David Whitmer|David Whitmer]] and two other brethren for
the western part of [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]]. While
traveling we called at the house of Mr.
Moss for a drink of water. The woman
of the house shouted from the door that
they had no water for Mormonsâthat
they were afraid of the Cholera &amp;c; at
the same time throwing out her arms
as if defending herself from the cholera
in the form of a personage. We turned
and departed according to the command-
ment, and before a week had passed
the cholera entered that house and that
woman and three others of the family
were dead.

When the cholera made its appearance,
Elder [[John Sims Carter|John S. Carter]] was one of the first
who stepped forward to rebuke it, and
upon this was instantly seized, and be-
came the first victim in the camp. He
died about 6 o'clock in the afternoon; and
[[Seth Hitchcock|Seth Hitchcock]] died in about thirty min-
utes after. (and [[Erastus Rudd|Erastus Rudd]] died about
the same moment although half a mile
distant; he was buried by [[Jesse Johnson Smith|Jesse Smith]],
[[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]] and two or three others;
while burying him Jesse Smith wasadvanced yesterday from their encamp-
ment beyond [[Fishing River, Clay County, Missouri|Fishing River]] to [[Rush Creek, Clay County, Missouri|Rush Creek]],
where their tents are again pitched. But
feeling disposed to adopt every pacific
measure that can be done without
jeopardizing our lives, to quiet the pre-
judices and fears of some part of the
citizens of this county, we have conclu-
ded that our company shall be imme-
diately dispersed, and continue so till
every effort for an adjustment of dif-
ferences between us and the people of
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]] has been made on our part,
that would in any wise be required
of us by disinterested men of republican
principles.

I am respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith Jr.]]

N. B.âYou are now corresponding with
the [[Daniel Dunklin|govenor]], (as I am informed;) will
you do us the favor to acquaint him
of our efforts for a compromise. This in-
formation we want conveyed to the gove-
nor, inasmuch as his ears are stifled
with reports from Jackson, of our hostile
intentions, &amp;c
J.S.of this terrible disease.

At the commencement [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] attempted
to lay on hands for their recovery
but I quickly learned by painful
experience that when the great Jehovah
decrees destruction upon any people
and makes known his determination,
man must not attempt to stay his
hand. The moment I attempted
to rebuke the disease, I was attacked;
it seized upon me like the talons of
a hawk, and I said to the brethren
if I had had my work done, you
would have had to tumble me into
the ground without a coffin; and had
I not desisted I must have saved the
life of my brother by the sacrifice of my
own.
June 25, 1834 ~ Wednesday


June 25th. Early this morning the camp
was separated into small bands and
dispersed among the brethren living in
the vicinity.

[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] wrote and sent by ex-
press to Messrs. Thornton, [[Alexander William Doniphan|Doniphan]], and
[[David Rice Atchison|Atchison]] as follows:â

[[Rush Creek, Clay County, Missouri|Rush Creek]], Clay County,

[[Algernon Sidney Gilbert|A. S. Gilbert]]
June 24, 1834 ~ Tuesday


June 24th. We resumed our march for
[[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]], Clay County by a circuitous
route around the head of Fishing
River, to avoid the deep water.

When within five or six miles of
Liberty we were met by Gen. [[David Rice Atchison|Atchison]]
and other gentlemen who desired us not
to go to Liberty because the feelings of
the people were so much enraged against
us. At their solicitations we changed
our course, wheeled to the left and cross-
ing the prairie and woodland came
to Br. [[Algernon Sidney Gilbert|A. S. Gilbert's]] residence and
encamped on the bank of [[Rush Creek, Clay County, Missouri|Rush Creek]]
in Br. Barker's field.

^*^ This night the C^c^holera burst forth
upon us and about midnight it was
manifest in its most terrific form,âour
ears were saluted with cries and moan-
ings and lamentations on every hand.
Even those on guard fell to the earth
with their guns in their hands, so tooâ
sudden and powerful was the attackdifferences existing between our people
or society and the inhabitants of Jackson
County upon honorable and constitutional
principles.

Therefore, if the said inhabitants of
Jackson County will not let us return to
our lands in peace, we are willing to
propose firstly:â That twelve disinterested
men, six to be chosen by our people and
six by the inhabitants of Jackson County,
and these twelve men shall say what
the sands [lands] of those men are worth in
that county who cannot consent to live
with us: and they shall receive their
money for the same in one year from
the time the treaty is made, and
none of our people shall enter the coun-
ty to reside till the money is paid.
The said twelve men shall have
power also to say what the damages
shall be for the injuries we have sus-
tained in the destruction of property and
in being driven from our possessions;
which amount of damages shall be
deducted from the amount for their lands.

Our object is peace, and an early
answer will be expected

[[Peter Whitmer Jr.|Peter Whitmer Jr.]], [[Simeon Dagget Carter|Simeon Carter]], Newel
Knight, [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]], Christian Whit-
mer and [[Solomon Hancock|Solomon Hancock]] were called
and chosen and it was appointed
unto them to receive their endowments
in [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] with power from on
high to assist in gathering up the
strength of the Lord's House, and to
preach the everlasting Gospel.

[[Thomas Baldwin Marsh|Thomas B. Marsh]] was called and
chosen; and it was appointed unto
him to receive his endowment in
Kirtlandâhis office to be made
known hereafter.

[[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] was called and
chosen; and it was appointed unto
him to receive his endowments in
Kirtland with power from on high;
and to return to Zion and have
his office appointed unto him hereafter.

The same day the elders made
the following reply as before referred to,
to [[Samuel C. Owens|S. C. Owens]] and others, Committee
of the [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]] Mob.â

"We the undersigned committee
having full power and authority to
settle and adjust all matters andceive [[Edward Partridge|his]] endowments with power from

establishment in Kirtland until
Zion is redeemed.

[[Isaac Morley|Isaac Morley]] and [[John Corrill|John Corrill]]
were called and chosen, and it
was appointed unto them to receive
their endowments ^in Kirtland^ with power from

chosen and appointed to receive his en-
dowments in Kirtland as to assist
in gathering up the strength of the
Lords House and to proclaim the
everlasting Gospel until Zion is redeemed;of the Celestial Kingdom and Zion
cannot be built up.

Previous to crossing the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]],
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] had called the camp together and
told them that in consequence of the
disobedience of some, who had been
unwilling to listen to my words, but
had rebelled, God had decreed that
sickness should come upon the camp
and if they did not repent and hum-
ble themselves before God, they should
die like sheep with the rot; that I
was sorry but could not help it; the
scourge must come, repentance and
humility may mitigate the chastisement
but cannot altogether avert it, as there
were some who would not give heed
to my words.
June 23, 1834 ~ Monday


Monday June 23rd. ^For additional see Millennial Star Vol 157.86.^ During this day
a council of High Priests assembled in
fulfilment of the revelation given the
day previous and the following indi-
viduals were called and chosen as
they were made manifest unto me by
the voice of the spirit and revelation
to receive their endowments.

[[Edward Partridge|Edward Partridge]] was called and
chosen to go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] and re-been discovered or made known to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]]
enemies since I left [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]. Gil-
lium then gave us some instructions
concerning the manners, customs, and
dispositions of the people &amp;c and what
course we ought to pursue to secure
their favor and protection, making
certain inquiries to which we replied;
these were afterward published and will
appear under date of publication.

I received the following revelation
given on [[Fishing River, Clay County, Missouri|Fishing River]] Mo., June 22nd 1834.
^See Rev. June 22nd 1834.^

1st Verily I say unto you who have 
assembled yourselves together that you
may learn my will concerning the
redemption of mine afflicted people.

2 Behold I say unto you were it not
for the transgressions of my people, speak-
ing concerning the Church, and not in-
dividuals, they might have been redeem-
ed even now; but behold they have not
learned to be obedient to the things
which I require at their hands but are
full of all manner of evil and do
not impart of their substance, as becom-
eth Saints, to the poor and afflicted
among them, and are not united ac-
cording to the union required by lawentertain fears that our brethren in-
tend to invade their territory in a
hostile manner. We assure you that
their fears are groundless,âsuch is
not and never was our intention

Sunday 22nd. Br. [[Lyman Smith|Lyman Smith]]
received a wound from the accidental
discharge of a horse pistol from which
he recovered in about three days.
[[Cornelius Gilliam|Cornelius Gillium]], the sheriff of Clay
County, came to the camp to hold con-
sultation with us. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] marched my
company into a grove near by and
formed in a circle, with Gillium in
the center. Gillium commenced by
saying that he had heard that
Joseph Smith was in the camp, and
if so he would like to see him. I
arose and replied, "I am the man"

This is the first time that I hadthe same day the following to the com-
mitte of the [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] mob.

[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay Co.]] 21st, June, 1834.
Gentlemen: â

Your propositions
of Monday last have been generally
made known to our people, and
we are instructed to inform you
that they cannot be acceeded to.

Honorable propositions to you are
now making on our part, and we
think we shall be enable to deliver the
same to you the early part of next
week.

We are happy to have it in our
power to give you assurances that
our brethren here together with those
who have arrived from the east are
unanimously disposed to make every
sacrifice for an honorable adjustment
of our differences that could be requir-
ed of free citizens of the United States.

Negotiations at the camp are now
going on between some gentlemen of
this county and our brethren, which
are calculated to allay the great
excitement in your county. We are
informed that the citizens of Jacksonby our enemies for our religion, and
that we had come one thousand
miles to assist our brethren to bring
them clothing, &amp;c and to reinstate them
upon their own lands, and that we
had no intention to molest or injure
any people, but to administer to the
wants of our afflicted friends; and
that the evil reports circulated about
us were false and got up by our
enemies to procure our destruction.
When [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] had closed a lengthy speech
the spirit of which melted them into
compassion they arose and offered me
their hands and said they would
use their influence to allay the excite-
ment which every where prevailed aga-
inst us, and they wept when they
heard of our afflictions and perse-
cutions and that our intentions were
good. Accordingly they went forth
among the people and made unwear-
ied exertions to allay the excitement.

Bris. [[Ezra Thayer|Ezra Thayre]] and [[Joseph Hancock|Joseph Hancock]] 
were ^(are)^ sick with the cholera. Thomas
Hays was taken sick today (this is
fulfillment of the prophecy given June
3rd). The brethren in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] wrotehad near six hundred shots, very few
of which missed fire, which shows how
very careful the brethren had been in
taking care of their arms during the
storm. We went five miles on the prai-
rie where we could procure food for
ourselves and horses, and defend our-
selves from the rage of our enemies.
June 21, 1834 ~ Saturday


While in this situation, on Saturday, 21st,
Col. Sconce with two other leading men
from [[Ray County, Missouri|Ray County]] came to see us desiring
to know what our intentions were; "for"
says he, &quot;I see that there is an al-
mighty power that protects this people;
for I started from [[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]], Ray Coun-
ty, with a company of armed men
having a fixed determination to destroy
you; but was kept back by the storm
and was not able to reach you." When
he entered our camp he was seized with
such a trembling that he was obliged
to sit down to compose himself; and
when he had made known the ob-
ject of their visit, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] arose and address-
ing them gave a relation of the suf-
ferings of the Saints in Jackson Coun-
ty, and also of our persecutions gener-
ally, and what we had sufferedour tents and getting wet, while our
enemies had holes made in their
hats and otherwise received damage
such as the breaking of their rifle-
stocks and the fleeing of their horses
through fear and pain. Many of
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]] little band received shelter in an
old meeting house through this night.
In the morning the water in Big
Fishing River was about forty feet deep
where the previous evening it was no
more than to our ankles: and our
enemies swore that the water rose thirty
feet in thirty minutes in the Little Fish-
ing River.

They reported that one of their men
was killed by lightning, and that ano-
ther had his hand torn off by his
horse drawing his hand between the
logs of a corn crib while he was
holding him from the inside; and
they declared "If that was the way
God fought for the God damned Mor-
mons, they might as well go home
about their business."
June 20, 1834 ~ Friday


Friday 20th. This morning [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] coun-
selled the brethren to discharge all their
fire arms, when it was found we"forlorn hope" took the "back track" for
[[Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Independence]] to join the main body
of the mob, fully satisfied as were
the survivors of the company who
were drowned that when Jehovah fights,
they would rather be absent. The grati-
fication is too terrible.

Very little hail fell in our camp,
but from one half to one mile around
us the ^hail-^stones or lumps of ice cut down
the crops of corn and vegetation gen-
erally, even cutting limbs from trees
while the trees themselves were twisted
into withes by the wind. The light-
ning flashed incessantly which cau-
sed it to be so light in our camp
through the night that we could dis-
cern the most minute object. The roar-
ing of the thunder was tremendous.

The earth trembled and quaked,
the rain fell in torrents, and it
seemed as if the mandate of ven-
gence had gone forth from the God
of battles to protect his servants from
the destruction of their enemies, for
the hail fell on them and not on
us, and we suffered no harm ex-
cept the blowing down of some ofthose who held them. The horses fled
before the storm and were not found
for several days. It was reported
that the Captain of the company in
the school house said that it was a
dâd strange thing that they could
do nothing against the dâd Mormons
but what there must be a dâd hail
storm or some other dâd thing to
hinder them from doing anything.
But they did not feel disposed to
acknowledge that God was fighting
our battles."

The storm was tre-
mendousâwind and rain, hail and
thunder met them in great wrath and
soon softened their direful courage and
frustrated all their designs "to kill [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joe]]
Smith and his army." Instead of
continuing firing, which they commenced,
they crowded under wagons, into hol-
low trees, filled one old shanty &amp;c. and
when the storm was over their ammu-
nition was soaked; and the party in
[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] were extremely anxious
in the morning to return to [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]]
having experienced the pitiless peltings
of the storm all night. And as soon 
as arrangements could be made thisthe five men entered our camp there
was not a cloud to be seen in
the whole heavens, but as the men
left the camp there was a small
black cloud appeared in the north-
west and it began to unroll itself
like a scroll and in a few min-
utes the whole heavens were covered
with a pall as black as ink. This
indicated a sudden storm which soon
broke upon us with wind, rain, thun-
der, lightning and hail. Our beds
were soon afloat and our tents blown
down over our heads. We all fled
into the Baptist Meeting House. As the
prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] came in shaking
the water from his hat and clothing
he said, &quot;Boys, there is some mean-
ing in thisâGod is in the storm."
We sang praises to God and lay
all night on the benches under cover
while our enemies were in the pelting
storm. It was reported that the
mob cavalry who fled into the school-
house tried to hold their horses by the
bridles between the logs, but when
the heavy hail struck them, they all
broke away skinning the fingers of "See hell enough before morning"; and
their accompanying oaths partook of
all the malice of demons. They
told us that sixty men were coming
from [[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]], Ray County, and
seventy more from [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] to
join the [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] mob who
had sworn our utter destruction. The
weather was pleasant.

As [[Jezeniah B. Smith|Jazemiah B. Smith]] was taking
his bedding out of the wagon he
discovered a large rattle snake which
he had carried with him all day.

During the day the Jackson Co-
unty mob to the number of about
200 made arrangements to cross the
[[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] above the mouth of
[[Fishing River, Clay County, Missouri|Fishing River]] at William's Ferry, into
Clay County and be ready to meet
the Richmond mob near Fishing
River ford for our utter destruction.
But after the first scow load of
about forty had been taken across
the river, the scow in returning was
met by a squall and had great
difficulty in reaching the Jackson
side by dark.

Wilford Woodruff states that "whenman that will sell milk. I could
have let you had more if I had
known that you were coming"; and
he further said; "[[Joseph Smith Jr.|You]] have many ene-
mies about here and you may meet
with some trouble and it is a dam'd
shame that every man can't come
up and enjoy his religion and
everything else without being molested."
It was near noon when we fin-
ished our breakfast and we passed
on in fine spirits determined to go
through and meet the brethren in
[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]]. We travelled but a short
distance when one wagon broke down
and the wheels ran off from others
and there seemed to be many things to
hinder our progress although we strove
with all diligence to speed our way
forward. This evening we camped
on an elevated piece of land be-
tween [[Little Fishing River, Missouri|Little Fishing]] and Big Fishing
Rivers which was(?) formed by seven
small streams or branches. As we hal-
ted and were making preparations
for the night, five men armed with
guns, two of whom had swords rode
into our camp and told us we shouldthe tent when Br. [[John Carpenter|Carpenter]] took it
in his hands carried it beyond all
danger and left it to enjoy its liberty,
telling it not to return.
June 19, 1834 ~ Thursday


Thursday 19th. At daybreak feeling
that we were in a very unsafe 
situation, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] counselled the camp to
move forward without delay and con-
tinue a lively march for about nine
miles where we stopped for breakfast.
While passing through [[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]], Br.
[[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] observed a black woman
in a gentleman's garden near the
road. She beckoned to him and
said, "Come here massa"; she was
evidently much agitated in her feelings.
He went up to the fence and she said
to him, "There is a company of men
laying in wait here who are calcula-
ting to kill you this morning as you
pass through.["] We halted for breakfast
on an eminance near a farm-house.
The owner furnished us with a large
quantity of milk which gave a great
relish to our bacon and corn dodger
which our company had purchased
that morning. When we asked the price
of his milk he replied, "He is a meanAfter our 10 o'clock breakfast we
passed on to within one mile of
[[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]]. We encamped in a very
small prairie surrounded by a thicket
of hazel brush. When [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] arrived where
the camp had pitched their tents
and viewed our unsafe location con-
sidering the danger of an attack
from our enemies, I almost forgot
my sickness, went some distance in
the brush, bowed down and prayed
my heavenly father to suffer no evil
to come upon us, but keep us safely
through the night. I obtained an
assurance that we should be safe
until morning. Notwithstanding the
fact that about 50 of the Jackson
County mob crossed the Lemington Fer-
ry that evening for the purpose of
joining the [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] mob and of
making an attack upon us, all
was quiet in the camp through the
night. While the brethren were mak-
ing their bed in Capt. [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]]
tent, one of them discovered a very
musical rattle snake which they were
about to kill. Capt. Young told them
not to hurt it, but to carry it out ofmy counsel, and told [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] never
to do so again. He promised to stand
by [[Joseph Smith Jr.|me]] forever and never forsake me
again let the consequences be what it
would; but [[Sylvester Smith|Sylvester Smith]] manifested
very refractory feelings.
June 18, 1834 ~ Wednesday


Wednesday 18th. As [[Hiram Stratten|Hyrum Stratton]] and
his companions were taking up their
blankets this morning, they discovered
two prairie rattlesnakes quietly sleeping
under them which they carefully car-
ried out of the camp. This day [[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]]
health was so poor, I left the affairs
of the camp to the management of
Gen. [[Lyman Wight|Wight]]. Having no provisions, we
traveled seventeen miles before breakfast.
I rode in Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball's]] wagon. We
crossed a slough half a mile wide,
through which most of the brethren
were obliged to wade waist deep in
mud and water. Gen. Lyman Wight
who had travelled from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] with-
out a stocking on his foot, carried Br.
[[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] through on his back. Our
breakfast consisted entirely of corn meal
mush, or hasty pudding; we had not
meal enough in our company to make
the mush of the consistence of good starch.the prairie 8 or 10 miles. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|My]] brother Hy-
rum said he knew in the name of
the Lord that it was best to go on to
the prairie, and as he was my elder
brother, I thought best to heed his coun-
sel though some were murmuring in the
camp. We accordingly started. When Ly-
man Wight crossed the [[Missouri River, United States|river]] he disap-
proved of our moving onto the prairie,
upon which [[Sylvester Smith|Sylvester Smith]] placed him-
self in the road, turned back all that
he could by saying, "Are you following
your General, or some other man"? and
twenty staid behind with Lyman Wight.
We drove about 8 miles on the prairie
and encamped out of sight of timber.
The sun apparently went down and
rose again in the grass. Our company
had filled a couple of empty pow-
der kegs with water which tasted so
bad we could not drink it, and all
the water we had was out of a
slough filled with red living animals,
and was putrid. About eleven o'clock
Lyman Wight arrived with the company
that had remained with him. I
called them together and reproved them
for tarrying behind and not obeyingwhere the eagles, buzzards, ravens, crows and animals
ate [[James Campbell|his]] flesh from his bones, to fulfill his own
words, and left him a horriable looking skeleton
of God's vengeance which was discovered
about three weeks after by one Mr. Purtle.
[[Samuel C. Owens|Owens]] saved his life only after floating
four miles down stream where he lod-
ged upon an island, swam off to
shore, walked about daylight through
a field of settles, borrowed a mantle
from a woman to hide his shame
and slipped home rather shy of the
vengeance of God
June 17, 1834 ~ Tuesday


Tuesday 17th. At noon we crossed the
[[Wyaconda River, United States|Wacondah]]; it being high we had to be
ferried over. We were informed here that
a party of men were gathering togeth-
er on the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] with the in-
tention of attacking us that night. The
prairie ahead of us was twenty-three
miles long without any timber or pal-
atable wholesome water. Some of the
brethren wished to stop near the timber
and were about making arrangements
to pitch their tents. We had but little
provisions; [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] proposed to get some wood
and water to carry with us and go onto the Saints in offering to buy their lands at
one hundred percent in thirty days and offering
their's on the same terms, but when it is understood
that the mob held possession of a much larger quantity
of land than the Saints and that they only offered
thirty days for the payment having previously rob[b]ed
them of nearly every thing that they had, it whould
be readily seen that they were only making a sham
to cover their previous unlawful conduct, but the
tempest of an immediate conflict seemed to be checked
and the [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]] Mob to the number of about fifteen
with [[Samuel C. Owens|Samual E. Owens]] and [[James Campbell|James Campbell]],
at their head started for [[Independence, Jackson County, Missouri|Independance]] Jackson
County to raise an army sufficient to meet me
before I could get into [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]]. Campbell
swore as he adjusted his pistols in his holsters, "The
Eagles and Turkey buzzards shall eat my flesh if I
do not fire [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joe Smith]] and his army so that their 
skin will not hold shucks before two days are passed.
They went to the ferry and undertook to cross the
[[Missouri River, United States|Missouri River]] after dark and the Angel of God
saw fit to sink the boat about the middle of the
river, and seven out of twelve that attempted to cross
were drowned. Thus suddenly and justly went
to their own place by water. Campbell was among
the missing he floated down the river some four or
five miles, and lodged upon a pile of drift woodyou an answer as soon as Saturday or Monday
next. We can say for ourselves and in behalf of
our brotherin that peace is what we desire, and what
we dispose to cultivate with all men, and to effect
peace we feel disposed to use all our influence as
far as it whould be required at our hands, as
free common citizens of the United States, and
as fears have been expressed that we designed to
commence hostilities against the inhabitants of
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], we have pledged ourselves to
them, and to the hospitable Citizens of [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]]
that we will not, neither had designed as a people
to commence hostilities against the afore said
Citizens of Jackson County, or any other people.
Our answer shall be handed to Judge Turnham
the Chairman of the Meeting even earlier than
the time before stated if possiable.

NB. as we are informed that a large number
of our people are on their way removing to Jackson
County, we agree to use our influence amediately
to prevent said company from entering into
Jackson County untill you shall receive an
answer to the proposition afore named.
It may be thought at first view that the
mob committee made a fair propositionanother "go on", and in the midst of this awful
crisis a person bawled into to doors "a man stabbed"
the mass instantly rushed to the spot, in hopes,
as some said that one damed Mormon had got 
killed, but as good luck whould have it, only one
Missourian had dirked another, (one Colbert a
blacksmith had stabbed one Males, who had
previously whipped one Mormon nearly to death
and boasted of having whipped many more.) the
wound was dangerous and as the Lord was there
it seemed as though the occurance was nessary
to brake up the meeting without further bloodshed
and give the Saints a chance to consult what
whould be most advisable in such a critical
instant, and they amediately penned the following
answer to the propositions from [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]],
presented by [[Samuel C. Owens|Owens]] &amp;c.,

Gentlemen,
Your propositions for an
adjustment of the difficulties between the Citizens
of Jackson County, and the Mormons is before
us, and as explained in the Court House this day,
we are not authorised to say to you that our
brotherin will submit to your proposel, but we
agree to spread general notice, and call a meeting
of our people in all, the present week, and lay beforeparties are to remain â â â â as they are till
the payment is made at which time the people
of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] will give possession. Signâââ

Noland, [[Thomas Hayton Sr.|Thomas Hayton Sen.]], [[Robert Rickman|Robert Rickman]],
[[Thomas Campbell|Thomas Campbell]], [[Abraham McClellon|Abraham Mc Clellon]]. On
presentation of the foregowing Samual C Owens
made a flaming war speech, and Genl [[Alexander William Doniphan|Doniphan]]
replied on the side of peace. The Revd Mr. Riley, a
baptist, made a hot speech against the Mormons
and said the Mormons had lived long enough in
[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] and they must either clear out, or
be cleared out. Turnham the Moderator of the Meeting
answered in a masterly manner saying, "Let us be
republicans, let us honor our Country and not
disgrace it like Jackson County, for Gods sake
dont disfranchise or drive away the Mormons, they
are better citizens than many of the old inhabitants"
General Doniphan exclaimed, "Thats a fact, and as
the Mormons have armed themselves if they dont
fight they are cowards, I love to hear that they
have brotherin comeing to their assistance, grater
love can no man show, than he who lays down
his life for his brotherin." At this critical instant,
the cocking of pistols, the jingle of insterments of death,
[blank] desperation, one motioned "adjourn"any effort [e]verafter to settle either collectively or
individually within the limits of Jackson
County. The Mormons are to enter into bonds
to insure the conveyances of their lands in Jackson
County according to the above terms when the
payment shall be made and the committee
will enter into a like bond with such security
as may be deemed sufficient for the payment
of the money according to the above prepositions.
While the arbitrators are investigating and
deciding upon the matters preposed to
them, the Mormons are not to attempt to
enter Jackson County or to settle there except
such as are by the foregoing prepositions
permitted to go there. They further propose
that the people of Jackson County will sell all
their lands and improvements on public
lands in Jackson County to the Mormons
the valuation to be obtained in the same
manner the same percent in addition to
be paid, and the time the money is to
be paid is the same as the above set forth
reâââââeth in our proposition to buy. The
Mormons to give good security for the payment
of the money, and the undersigned will to
give security that the land will
to the Mormons. They further propose that allbuy all the lands that the said Mormons
own in the County of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]] and also
all the improvements which the said Mormons
had on any of the public lands in said
County of Jackson as they exhisted before the
first disturbance between the people of Jackson
and the Mormons, and for such as they have
made since. They further more propose that the
valuation of said land and improvements shall
be ascertained by three disintrested inhabitants to
be chosen and agreed to by both parties. They
further propose that should the parties disagree
in the choice of arbitraters then ; ; ; ; is to choose
them. They further more propose that twelve
of the Mormons shall go along with the arbi-
trators to show them the land and improvements
while valueing the same, and such others of
the Mormons as the arbitrators shall want to
do so to give them information, and the people
of Jackson County garentee their entire safety
while doeing so, they further propose that
when the arbitraters report the value of the land
and improvements as afore said, the people of
Jackson County will pay the valuation with
one hundred percent added thereon, to the
Mormons within thirty days thereafter. They further
propose that the Mormons are not to makebare feet, [[Martin Harris|he]] received a bite on his left foot, it
was communicated to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|me]], and I took accasion
to reprove him, and exhorted the brotherin never
to trifle with the promises of God, I told them
it was presumption for any one to provoke
a serpant to bite him, but if a man of God,
was accidentaly bitten by a poisonous serpant
he might have faith or his brotherin might
have faith for him so that the Lord whould
hear his prayer, and he might be healed, but
when a man designedly provokes a serpant to
bite him the principle is the same as when a
man drinks deadly poison knowing it to be
such, in that case no man has claim on
the promises of God to be healed. The citizens of
[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] (to the number of eight hundred
or a thousand among whom were the brotherin)
assembled at the Court-house in [[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]] agree
ably to the request of Judge [[John F. Ryland|Rayland]] in his
letter of the 10th instant, where they met Judge Raynald
and a deputation from [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]] who presented
the following propositions of the people of Jackson
County to the Mormons,

The undersigned Committee being fully
authorized by the people of Jackson County,
hereby propose to the Mormons that they willfeeling and prejudice that exhisted against
us in [[Missouri|Missouri]] in all quarters, but it gave
us great satisfaction to receive intellagence from
[[Edward Partridge|him]] of the union and good feelings that
prevailed among the brotherin; as we were in
perrils and threatened all the while we were
muched troubled to get provissions, and had
to live on corn meal principly, and was glad
to get that. Here [[Dean Gould|Dean Gould]] was baptized
by [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]].

Monday 16th,
Traveled too, ferried over, and encamped on
the bank of [[Grand River, Iowa and Missouri|Grand River]], the ferryman
intended charging seventeen dollars, the
brotherin said they whould not pay it,
but whould sooner make a raft and
ferry themselves over, he then agreed to take
them over for twelve dollars which we accepted.
This morning was exceedingly hot, no air
stirring, and traveling in the thick woods, a
thunder shower coming on, the brotherin caught
all the water they could on the brims of their
hats, and not catching enough to satisfy their
thirst, they drank out of horsetracks. Martin
Harris having boasted to the brotherin that
he could handle snakes with perfect safety,
While fooling with a blue snake with hisThe foregowing was inclosed in the following
letter to their Lawyers,

Gentlemen,
Will you be so good
as to read the inclosed then seal and hand to
the [[John F. Ryland|Judge]]. We have given him an early hint
fearing that he might be induced by the sol-
icitation of our enemies to prepare a sale of our
lands, which you well know whould be like
selling our children into slavery, and urging of
such a measure whould avail nothing unless to
produce an excitement against us in this country
as requested last Thursday. We hope you will
be present on Monday.

Your friends and servants,

Saturday [Sunday] 15th,
Traveled twelve miles, on the way [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]]
and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] returned to us from Jefferson
City, and reported that Governer [[Daniel Dunklin|Dunkin]]
refused to fulfill his promice to reinstate the
brotherin on their lands in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]
on the grounds of impracticability. We crossed
the [[Chariton River, Missouri|Chariton River]] at its mouth and encamped
on the west bank. Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Patridge]] came into the
camp from [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], we received much
information from him concerning the hostilelaudible disposition manifested on [[John F. Ryland|your]] part
to effect peace between our society and the inhabitants
of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], and as many as can con-
veniently will be present on Monday next. Entertaining
some fears that your honor in his zeal for peace
might unwarily recommend a sale of our lands
in Jackson County we have thought it expedient
to give reasonable notice that no such proposition
could reasonable be consented to by our Society
we have not heard that it was the intention of
your honor to urge any such measure, but our
enemies in Jackson County have long been
trying to effect this object. In a letter from
the [[Daniel Dunklin|Governer]] he says "I have been requested to
advice the Mormons to sell out and move
away but beliving that it could have no good
effect, I have withheld my advice." We give
this quotation from the Governer's letter to
disprove the statement made in the Upper
Missouri Enquirer of last Wednsday, and
conclude by adding that home is home, and
we want possession of our homes from which
we have been wickedly expelled, and thoes
rights which belonge to us, as natural free-born
citizens of the United States.

We are respectfully your friends and servant,

belonged to [[Roger Orton|Roger]] to see that the teams were
attended to, but as the team was [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball's]], and
he had taken the care of it all through, Ortons
still threw the care on him. The Silver grey company
numbering fourteen were attached to my mess
making it twenty eight in numbers.

Saturday 14
Brother [[Joseph Hancock|Joseph Hancock]] and another of the brotherin
we're chased a considerable po[r]tion of the day by
four suspicious fellows on horsback armed with
guns, whom they attracted by traveling in the
brush and thickets where horsmen could not
ride; it was late when they returned to camp.
At night we encamped in an unsafe and un-
plesant situation, in a small ravine the
only place we could get water for some miles.
The country was a wild uninhabited region.
In answer to the Judge the Elders wrote

Hon. [[John F. Ryland|J. F. Rayland]], Near [[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]], 14 June 1835^4^
Dear Sir,
Your communication
of the 9th I'nst, from [[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]], was duly
received, and at a public meeting of our society
this day its contents made known, our brotherin
unanimously rendered their thanks for the aid me with all your influence with your
brotherin in the prosecution of an object so much
to be desired by all good men, and citizens,
Yours very respectfully,
[[John F. Ryland|John F. Ryland]].
June 12, 1834 ~ Thursday


June 12th,
We left [[Salt River, Missouri|Salt River]] and traveled about fifteen
miles. The inhabitants manifested a great
respect for us, and many of them accompanied
us some distance on our journey. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] instructed
the camp in the morning, that if a gun
was fired it whould be considered an alarm,
but in the course of the day while I was
a little ahead, I shot a squirel for brother
[[James Foster|Foster]], when several of the brotherin came running
up to see what was the matter. I told them brother
Foster was sick. I want you should pray for him.
June 13, 1834 ~ Friday


Friday 13th,
Elder [[Heber Chase Kimball|Kimball's]] horses through the negligance of
the guard got loose and went back ten miles
with others; he persued them and brought them
back to camp. [[Frederick Granger Williams|F. G. Willam]] and Roger
Orton received a very severe chastisement for
neglect of orders in not taking care of the teams
when in charge of the guards. The reproof
given to Roger Orten was more particularly
for suffering Elder Kimball to go back after the to do all in [[John F. Ryland|my]] power to settle or allay the
difficulties between the Mormons and the Citizens
of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]. I have concluded that it
might have some tendency to affectuate this
object by having the Mormons called togather
at [[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]] next Monday, and there explain to
them my notions and views of their present
situation, and of the circumstances attendant,
I therefore request you to use all your influence
with your brotherin to get them to meet me on
next Monday in Liberty. I much fear and
dread the consequences that are yet to ensue unless
I should succeed in my wishes to restore peace.
It is the duty of all good men to use all proper
and laudible means to establish peace. I expect a
deputation of some of the most respectable citizens
of Jackson County will meet me on Monday next
at Libert, I call upon you in the name of hu-
manity therefore to leave no effects untried to
collect your brotherin at Liberty as requested.
Should my efforts to make peace fail of suc-
cess there can at least be no wrong Sir in
the attempt, and I [s]hall enjoy the concelation
of having done my duty as a man as
well as a christian. I hope Sir, you will
duly appricate the motive which prompts
me to address this letter to you, and willThe foregoing letter endorced the following order
City of [[Jefferson City, Cole County, Missouri|Jefferson]] June 4th 1834,

[[Thomas Pitcher|Thomas Pitcher]], Lut. Col. Commandant,
of the 33rd Regiment,

Sir,
On the 2nd
day of last May I showed an order to Col.
Lucas to deliver the fifty two guns and one
pistol, which you received from the Mormons on
the 5th day of November last, and reported to him
on the 3rd day of the succeeding December to W.
W. Felps, [[Edward Partridge|E. Patridge]], [[John Corrill|John Corrill]], [[John Whitmer|John Whitmer]],
and [[Algernon Sidney Gilbert|A. L. Gilbert]] on their order; On the 24 ultimo
Col. Lucus wrote and informed me that he had
resigned his Commission, and left the County
of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]]. You as Commandant of said regi-
ment are therefore commanded to collect the
said arms if they are not already in your posession,
and deliver them to the aforesaid gentlemen, on
their order.

Respectfully,
[[Daniel Dunklin|Danial Dunken]],
Commander in Chief,

The following day Judge [[John F. Ryland|Ryland]] wrote the follo-
ing,

[[Richmond, Ray County, Missouri|Richmond]] 10th June 1834,

Sir, 
Deeply impressed with a desirecaptain of the second, and [[George Albert Smith|Gorge A. Smith]] [[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]]
armor bearer, [[Frederick Granger Williams|F. G. Willams]] quarter master,
[[Zerubbabel Snow|Z. Snow]] commissary, [[Nathan Tanner|Nathan Tanner]] assistant,
[[Sylvester Smith|Sylvester Smith]] adjutant, the remainder of the
camp was organized into companies of ten.
While at [[Salt River, Missouri|Salt River]] General [[Lyman Wight|Wight]] marsheled the
camp on the prairie and inspected our fire locks
ordered the discharge of the same at targets by plat-
toons, drilled us half a day, and about this 
time I dispatched Elders [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and Parley
P. Pratt to [[Jefferson City, Cole County, Missouri|Jefferson City]] with a message to
Governer [[Daniel Dunklin|Dunken]], to ascertain if he was ready to
fulfill the proposition which he had previously
made to the brotherin to reinstate them on their
lands in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], and leave them there
to defend themselves. June 4th Governer Dunken
wrote to [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] and others, as follows; Mailed
at City of Jefferson 9th June 1835 [1834]. Herewith you
have a second order for the delivery of your arms now
in the possession of the Milita of Jackson County.
Col. Lucus has resigned his command he informs
me; If Lut. Col. [[Thomas Pitcher|Pitcher]] should be arrested before
you receive this, you will please hold up the order
untill I am informed who may be appointed
to the command of the regiment,
Respectfully,
Danial Dunken,now numbered two hundred and five men, all
armed and equiped as the law directs; it was
delightful to see the companies, for they were all
young men, except one company whom we called
the Silver Grays, and who ate at [[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]] table. We
were all in good spirits, and were taught the
sworde exercise by brother [[William Cherry|Willam Cherry]] (who was a
native of [[Ireland|Ireland]]) an expert drill master, who had
been in the British dragoon service for upwords of twenty
years, and deservs much credit for his unwearied
exertions ^in^ importing all he knew to the brotherin.
This was our first attempt at learning the sworde
exercise; brother [[Hiram Stratten|Hiram Stratton]] and [[Nelson Tubbs|Nelson Tubbs]]
procured a shop of Myers Mabley, and repared
every firelock that was out of order in the camp,
and [[David Elliott|David Elliot]] shod our horses. Here brother
[[James Foster|James Forster]] was taken sick, I proposed to him
to remain behind he said, "Brother Joseph let me
go with you if I die on the road." I told him
in the name of the Lord if that was his faith, to
go on his bed in the wagon and he whould
get better every day untill he recovered, which was
literally fulfilled. We reorganized the camp, I was
acknowledged the Commander-in-chief, Lyman
Wight General; I chose twenty men for my life guard
consisting of two companies, (my brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]]
was chosen captain of the first ten, and [[Roger Orton|Roger Orton]]One night we camped in the middle of a prairie
without water; one man took a spade and said,
["]Who knows but I can find water here." and dug
a small hole, which soon filled with good water;
when the brotherin saw this, they said it was as
much a miracle as for Moses to bring water out
of the rock
June 8, 1834 ~ Sunday


Sunday the 8th.
We were joined by [[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]] brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram Smith]]
and [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] with another company, who
started from [[Pontiac, Oakland County, Michigan Territory|Pontiac]], Michigan Ter. May the 5th,
the same day that we started from [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], they
having passed through [[Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County, Michigan|Ann Arber]], [[Jackson, Jackson County, Michigan|Jacksonburg]],
[[Spring Arbor, Jackson County, Missouri|Spring Arbor]], [[Constantine, St. Joseph County, Missouri|Constantine]], [[Elkhart, Elkhart County, Indiana|Elkhart]], crossed the
[[Illinois River, Illinois|Illinois river]] one mile below [[Ottawa, LaSalle County, Illinois|Attawa]], Pleasant
Grove, [[Pekin, Tazewell County, Illinois|Pekin]], [[Quincy, Adams County, Illinois|Quincy]], and Polmepa. [[Elijah Fordham|Elijah Fordham]]
was their Historian, Lymon Wight Steward,
Hiram Smith, and [[Samuel Bent|Samual Bent]] Moderator. We
had agreed to meet at this point, and the first
that arrived was to wait for the other, and it was
a happy meeting. Soon after the arrival of brother
Hiram and his company, I dispatched brother
[[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] and [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Almon W. Babbet]] with
messages to the brotherin in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], fearing
that the letter which I sent from [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] had
miscarried. [[James Alberd Sr.|James Alberd Sen.]] and ten others of
this branch of the Church joined our camp whichmen who had previously followed, passed us sevral
times during the day, and were in search of us
this evening, the guards heard them say; ["]They have
turned aside dam 'em, we cant find 'em." Elders Seth
Johnson and [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|A. M. Babbett]] who had been sent to
[[Bowling Green Township, Fayette County, Illinois|Bowling Green]] branch to gather recruits returned
to the camp on the morning of the 7th, with a
small company two wagons and sevral spare horses
June 7, 1834 ~ Saturday


Saturday the 7th,
One of the camp walked on ahead to procure some
milk; A number of men armed with guns met
him and said, "Here is one damed mormon alone
lets kill him," but at the same instant discovered a
number of others just coming over the hill, when they
immediately rode off in great haste. In the evening
encamped in a grove near a spring in Monroe
County where was a branch of the church known as
the [[Salt River, Missouri|Salt River]] church, and frequently called the
Akered settlement. Here we remained sevral days,
washing our clothes, and preparing to resume our
journey. [[Levi Ward Hancock|Levi Hancock]] says, "while here I worked
on guns, I also made a flag staff and put on
it a white flag tipped with red and put it
on my wagon, and put on it an eagle, and
printed on it in large letters Peace; and as we went
through the settlements, many whould come, and
look at my flag and say peace, and walk off.company, and gave vent to his feelings against
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|myself]] in particular in consequence growling
at him while he was marching the company up
to the camp, he being the last that came over
the [[Mississippi River, United States|river]]. The next morning I told them that
I whould desend to the spirit that was manifested
by some of the brotherin to let them see the folly of
their wickedness. I rose up and commenced speaking
by saying, "If any man insults me or abuses me
I will stand in my own defence, at the expense
of my life, and if a dog growls at me I will let
him know that I am his master." At this moment
[[Sylvester Smith|Sylvester Smith]] who had just returned from here he
had just turned out his horses to feed, came up
and hearing me mak the remarks said, "If, that
dog bites me I will kill him." I turned to Sylvester
and said, "If you kill that dog I'll whip you." And
went on to show the brotherin how wicked and un-
christianlike such conduct appeared before the
eyes of truth and justice. (The elders in [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]]
wrote Governer [[Daniel Dunklin|Dunklin]] as follows) (if nessary to
insert in this history, this letter will be found in Book
A. No. 2 page 320.) from the [[Missouri|Missouri]] Enquirer page
322 to 324)

June the 6th,
We resumed our journey, and at night encamped
in a yard in a maple grove, near the creek. TheJune 4, 1834 ~ Wednesday


Wednesday the 4th,
We crossed the large island which was about five
miles wide and encamped on the bank of the
[[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]]. We were short of provisions, having
little else but Indian meal; and no water
axcept the river, which we carried across the Mississippi.
Many of the company had the dispasition to
scatter in the woods for hunting, but [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] advised
them to the contrary. Some of the brotherin went
on to the sand bar, and got a quantity of turtles
eggs as they supposed, I told them they were
snake eggs, and they must not eat them, but
some of the brotherin thought they knew more than
I did about it, and still presisted in declairing that
they were turtles eggs, I said they were snakes eggs,
"eat snakes eggs will you, the man that eats them
will be sorry for it; you will be sick.&quot; Notwithstand-
ing all I said sevral brotherin did eat them and
were sick all the day after
June 5, 1834 ~ Thursday


Thursday the 5th.
We crossed the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi river]], which was a tedious
job, having but one small flat boat, and the river
being nearly one and a half miles wide; while
some were ferrying, others were engaged in hunting,
fishing &amp;c. As we arrived we encamped on the bank
within the limits of [[Missouri|Missouri]]. While at this place,
[[Sylvester Smith|Sylvester Smith]] rebelled against the order of theyou not watch, and keep guard." "Why yes," said
the priest, "but these are Mormons." "Well I cant
hear but they mind their own business, and if
you, and this stranger (meaning [[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]])
will mind your own business, every thing
will be right." This baptist priest, treated brother
Luke Johnson with great politeness, gave him
his dinner; his wife washed his stockings, gave
him letters of interduction to men in Jackson
County, delivered to his charge some letters that
he had received from Jackson County, which brother
Luke brought into camp; he also stated that he had
seen a man that morning, who informed
him that four hundred men were in readiness,
on the [[Missouri|Missouri]] side, at ten hours notice to use up
all the camp, and he was on his way to give them
notice a little before midnight. We heard sevral
guns fired, to the west of us, which appeared to be
answered by one directly east. There was no settle-
ment west of us nearer the state of Missouri, this
appearing so much like a signal, in addition
to the many threats of our being attacted on cross-
ing the [[Mississippi River, United States|Mississippi]], [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] considered sufficant cause
of alarm to put out a double picket guard, and
place the camp in a state of defence, so that every
man might be ready at a moments notice; it
however proved to be a false alarm.on brother [[Zebedee Coltrin|Zebeda Colton]], (our cook) and told
him to be quick and fry some ham, as
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] had not had my hunger fairly appeased
for forty eight hours; he amediately commenced
cooking the ham, and for once my company
feasted to their full satisfaction. We had just
retired to rest, when the picket guard announced,
[[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]]. He came into our tent, and
made his report. He had visited a number
of influential men, among the rest a
baptist minister, who expressed great anxiety
that our company should be stopped, and
went to the Magistrate to inquire if there was
not some law or pretense for stopping us. He
(the priest) said to the Magistiate, that the com-
pany marched, and had guns like an army,
they pitched their tents by the side of the road; they
set out guards, and let no body pass into their
camp at night, and they are Mormons; and
I believe they are gowing to kill the people up in
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], Missouri, and retake their
lands. The Magistrate replied, "If you were
traveling, and did not want to put up at
public houses, or there was none in that country,
whould you not camp by the roadside in a tent;
and if you were afraid that your horses, or property
whould be stolen in a strange country; whouldappeared among them, and they whould die
like sheep with the rot; still if they whould repent,
and humble themselves before the Lord, the
scourage in a great measure might be lessened,
but as the Lord lived this camp will suffer by
giving away to such unruly temper. This
speach affected every soul in camp, I do not
think there was a dry eye in camp. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] the
Prophet says, I had a conversation with Col.
Ross, (a wealthy gentleman in the neighborhood)
who gave us a flattering account of the country,
and wished to employ one hundred men for
which he proposed to make ready payment. He
wanted brick makers, builders ect etc. Our commisary
purchased twenty five gallons of honey at twenty
five cents a gallon, and a dozzen [[Missouri|Missouri]]
cured hams, which proved to have been a little
improved on the out side; there not being enough
to supply one for every company; my company
agreed to do without; our supper consisted of
mush and honey, as we had been unable
to procure flour on account of the scarcity of
mills, after the fetagues of the day, it hardly
satisfied our hunger, but when we had quite
finished, some six of the hams were brought to
our tent door, and thrown down in anger
saying, "we dont eat stinking meat." I calledcurse had been taken from him because of his
righteousness. He was a warrior, and a chiefton
He fought under the prophet Onondagus, who
held domion from the east to the west sea includ-
ing the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky-mountains]]. Zelph had his thigh
bone broken from the sling of a stone, while
in battle, many years before his death. He
was killed in battle by the arrow found in
his back bone, dureing a great struggle
with the Lamenites, and I Wilford Woodruff,
carried the thigh bone to [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] and
burried it in that country, I intended to
have burried it in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], thinking
that some prophet might have prophisied to him
that the members of Zions camp whould have
taken his bones with them to Zion and burried
them their, when they went up to redeem Zion;
But not having the privlage of gowing to
Jackson County, I buried it in Clay County.
The same day that we left this mound; at
noon while resting our teams and ourselves,
Brother [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] called the camp togather, and after
giving them instructions, standing on a wagon
wheel, he prophesied unto the camp, and said
the Lord had proved to him, that there whould
be a scourage visit the camp in consiquince
of the fractious, and unruly spirit that[[Illinois River, Illinois|river]], as far as our vision could extend, and the
scenery was truly delightful. On the tops of the
mounds were stones which personated the
apperance of three altars, one above the other, accord-
ing to the ancient order, and the remains of bones
were shown over the surface of the ground.
Wilford Woodruff says, &quot;this mound was con-
sidered three hundred feet above the Illinois
river, we had a shovel and a hoe with us,
and while we were desending the mound, the
Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] stopped suddenly and pointed
to the ground and said. "Brotherin dig in there."
And when we had dug one foot we uncovered the
skeleton of a man, which was entire, and in a
good state of perservation, and between his ribs
in the back bone was found the stone point
of a lamanitish arrow, whiched produced his
death. [[Milton Holmes|Milton Homes]] took the arrow out of
the back bone, also one of the thigh bones which
had been broken, and took it to camp, and
put it into my wagon; and at noon while
resting in camp, the Prophet Joseph, while
lying in his wagon, was rap[p]ed in vision,
and the history of this man whoes body we
discovered, was shown unto him. His name
was Zelph he was a white lamanite, a large
thick set man, and a man of God. The(who stood in the door of a cabnit shop) that
he had counted a little rising of five hundred
men, and he could not tell how many there
were. This thing was attempted many times
in villages and towns, as we passed through,
and the people were never able to ascertain our
number. We traveled twenty four miles, crossed
the [[Illinois River, Illinois|Illioniois river]] at Phillips ferry and encamped
on the west bank. This morning we sent, brother
[[Luke Johnson|Luke Johnson]] to ascertain the feelings of the
people, and report to us, the country we passed
through was one of great scarsety though little
settled. [[Levi Ward Hancock|Levi Hancock]] repeats what ^[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]^ said, in our tent, "I want
you to remember what I say to you, the
Lord is gowing to give us dry weather now
till we get through, he has given us rain, that
we might have water on the prairie, you will
see the mercy of God in our favor all the way through
June 3, 1834 ~ Tuesday


Tuesday the 3rd.
Dureing our travels we visited sevral of the mounds
which had been thrown up by the ancient
inhabidants of this country, and this morning
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] went up on a high mound near the [[Illinois River, Illinois|river]]
accompanied by many of the brotherin. From
this mound we could over-look the tops of the
trees, and view the prairie on eather side of theDr. [[Frederick Granger Williams|Willams]] came down from [[Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois|Jacksonville]] with
the people, attended meeting and returned with
them. In the evening after supper, he left Jacksonville
and returned to camp, and reported that the
people universally (who had visited the camp)
expressed the highest satisfaction, with the treatment
and entertainment, and the good order that
prevailed in our midst, that one gentlemen said
he had vissited the camp, and presumed he
had questioned about one hundred of the
men, and had receieved polite answers to all
of his questions, but could not ascertain who
they were, where they were gowing, or what
were their business, and I believe them a fine
set of fellows or a pack of damn knaves and
I cannot tell for my life which. Another
intellagent gentlemen remarked that he did
not believe there was a collage in the United
States, that could turn out such an aloquent
set of preachers, as he had heard that day
in the camp. Dr. Willams said he had heard
hundred of such like remarks at Jacksonville,
and the most perfect good humor prevailed
throughout the town.
June 2, 1834 ~ Monday


Monday June 2nd,
We passed through [[Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois|Jacksonville]], they undertook
to count us, and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] heard one man say,[[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], and said to him, When these
brotherin get through speaking to the people
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] wish you to make a few remarks reasoning
on the importance of a union of all the differant
sects, and denominations. These brotherin
complied with my request, and the cong-
gregation was also eddefied by elder Orson
Hyde on baptism for the remission of sins,
by [[Hiram Stratten|Hiram Stratton]] exhorting the people to
obey the gospel, and [[Eleazer Miller|Eleazar Miller]] gave a
powerful exortation. After the services of the
day were closed, many strangers made
remarks on the preaching they had heard,
they though[t] [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] was a methodist
and were anxious he should stay in that
country and preach. They supposed Brigham
Young was a close communion baptist,
Orson Hyde a camblite, or reformed baptist,
[[Lyman Eugene Johnson|Lyman E johnson]] a presbytarian, Amasa
Lyman Lyman a presbytarian, Orson Pratt
a universalest and inquired very carefully
if we all belonged to one denomination, the
brotherin replied some of us were meathodists,
some baptists, some campbelites, resirectionests ect,.
At the close of the meeting the sacrement was
administered and professing christians of
every denomination were invited to pertake,and professing to be a most liberal free thinker,
spoke to the people very freely about one hour on
his particular views, his manner and style was
very unassuming, and affable; he was listened
to with great attention; and thoes present remarked
that he was one of the greatest reasoners they ever
heard. The free thinker was followed by John
S. Carter, who delivered a very elegant dis-
course on practical piety. Elder [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]]
spoke on the principles of free salvation, follow-
ed by Elder [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] who set forth
baptism as nessary for salvation. After a
few moments resess, at two oclock P.M. the
trumpet again sounded, and a large
congregation from [[Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois|jacksonvill]] and surrounding
country appeared again in the grove, many
of whom expressed a desire to hear that metho-
dist man again. So [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] called Br. Joseph
Young into my tent, and told him to
preach an animated sermon on free grace, and
told him he should have the spirit. I then
went to [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]], and said to him,
"I understand Mr. Lyman that you ar a
Prespetarian." "Yes" said he "I believe in that
doctrin" 'Well' said I, "I wish you whould
make a few remarks to the people on that subject,
after Mr. Young has done. I also sent for elderhorses ect, ect, but [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] soon discovered that he was
more sober than drunk, and that he was probably
a spy. Near night we arrived at a small stream
of water about one mile from [[Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois|Jacksonvill]] where
we found a paw paw bush in the road,
which had been dropped as a signal for
us to camp, by Dr. [[Frederick Granger Williams|F. G. Willams]], whom I
had sent forward in the morning on horse-
back, to select a camp ground and watch
the movements of our enemies. Here we pitched
our tents agreeably to my instruction about
sunset. Brother [[Roger Orton|Roger Norton]] proclaimed about,
that there whould be preaching under the trees,
within the camp at half past ten on the morrow.
There was only one stranger in the camp to
hear the appointment, Dr. Willams had
gone on to Jacksonville with his pill bags
to spend the night
June 1, 1834 ~ Sunday


Sunday, June the 1st.
This morning at half past ten oclock, our
trumpet (a common brass french horn) sound-
ed in the camp for preaching, there were some
two of three of the people from [[Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois|Jacksonville]], and
the surrounding country gathered under the trees
within our camp, and a chest was brought out
for the accomodation of the speaker, when squire
Cook (as [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] was called) amediately took the standwhere we were gowing than from a desire to
hinder us. A brother came to see us with news
that [[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]] brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]] had passed on west
the day before with a company about fifty
miles north of us and saying "he has a fine company,
and they all look mighty pert." I asked him to
accompany us to [[Missouri|Missouri]], he replied "I cannot."
He went and stayed with the spies at a tavern
over night, who said they had followed us three
hundred miles on purpose to take some advan-
tage of us. 
May 31, 1834 ~ Saturday


Saturday 31st.
In the morning this same brother came to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|me]]
and said, "I whould be mighty glad to go with
you, but my business is such I cannot; will
a hundred dollars do you any good." I replied
&quot;Yes it will, for we are short of money&quot; He ame-
diately mounted his horse and rode towards
[[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]], and within an hour after the camp
had started, he returned and said to me "I
am mighty sorry I cannot go with you
here is a hundred dollars, and if I had, had
a few days notice I whould halve got more."
At noon we halted for dinner. A man apparently
drunk, came to the camp and said he had
a large farm fourty cows, a little way ahead
and if we whould go there, he whould give
us all we wanted to eat and drink, feed ourso long pursued in very closely, changeing
their dress and horses several times a day.
Brother [[Eleazer Miller|Eleazer Miller]] with others joined the
company with three horses about noon, a
little east of [[Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois|Rochester]]. This recrute was
very seasonable as many of our horses were
afflicted as they very frequently were in
changing country climate and food.
Many of the horses after eating dry corn
and prairie grass would be served with
colic cholic, and bloat very badly. Brother
[[Ezra Thayer|Ezra Thayer]] administered a medacine
mixed in a great stone bottle, prepared
as follows, a three penny paper of tobbacco,
half an ounce of copperns, and two
table spoons full of cayenne pepper, and
the bottle filled with water when he could
not whisky, one half of a bottle constitutes
a dose and whould unvariably cure a
sick horse in a few minutes and is
worthy of rememberance. Br Thayer called
his medicine 18 by 24. We encamped about three
miles from [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] on [[Spring Creek, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield creek]].
[[Frederick Granger Williams|F. G. Willams]] and [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|A. M. Babbet]] returned
to the camp with two kegs of powder, and
reported, that the people were somewhat excited,
more however from a cureosity to knowin such circumstances so as not to injur 
each other. We traveled acrast the prairie, and
encamped in a strip of timber, where we
stopped to dine. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] wrote a letter to the brotherin
in [[Missouri|Missouri]] (dated camp of Israel) requesting
some of them to meet us as soon possiable,
and give us information of the state of things
in upper Missouri; and sent the letter to
[[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] Post-Office, by Dr [[Frederick Granger Williams|Willams]]. At this
place I discovered that part of my company
had been served with sower bread while
I had received good sweet bread from the
same cook. I reproved Br. [[Zebedee Coltrin|Zebrada Coltrin]]
for partiality, for I wanted my brotherin
to fair as well as I did. (The brotherin in
[[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] wrote the following letter
to his Excellency [[Daniel Dunklin|Danial Dunkin]], [[Liberty, Clay County, Missouri|Liberty]],
Missouri May the 29th, 1834 Sir. (copy the letter
from page 317 A. No. 2)
May 30, 1834 ~ Friday


Friday the 30th
[[Frederick Granger Williams|Fredrick G. Willams]] and [[Almon Whiting Babbitt|Almon W. Babbet]]
went ahead into [[Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield]] in disguise
to learn the feelings of the people, and
procure some powder. We passed through
Springfield our appearance excited considerable
curiosity, and a great many questions
were asked, the spies who had followed usthe ground, when their blood was hot
and very likely to take diseases such as
ague, fever and fever which is perverted in this
climate, as they ought never to lie on the
ground, (which is alwase) damp) when their blood
was hot, they whould also be in danger of
being killed by our enemies, and none of
us be the wiser for it. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] then proposed for a
diversion, that we divide the camp into
three parts, and have a sham battle, which
was agreed to by all. Brother [[Roger Orton|Roger Orton]]
lead one part; [[Frederick Granger Williams|Fredrick G. Willams]] another
division; and I remain in camp with 
third division. They returned to the woods
with their divisions, and soon attacted the
camp, which we defended by various manuvers
for some time many of our Captains showed
considerable tact, and was more acquainted
with miletary matters, than I had expected.
Every thing went off with good feeling, although
captain [[Heber Chase Kimball|Heber C. Kimble]] in receving a charge
grasped captain [[Lewis Zabriskie|Lewis Zabriskie's]] sword and
in indeavering to take it from him had
the skin cut from the paum of his hand.
After the sham battle was over, I called the
camp together, and cautioned them to be
careful in the future, and controal their spiritsexceedingly weary leaid down on the
prairie to rest himself and fell asleep. When
he awoke he saw a rattle snake which lay
between him and his hat, which he
had in his hand when he fell asleep, coiled
up within one foot of his head. The brotherin
gathered around him saying, "It is a rattle
snake let us kill it." But, Br. [[Solomon Humphrey III|Humphry]] said
"No I'll protect him, you shant kill him, for he and
I have had a good nap together.["]
May 28, 1834 ~ Wednesday


May the 28th.
We passed on as usual axcept suffering
much for the want of water and provisions,
and arrived at Decatus township; encamped
on a small stream of water, where one of brother
Tanner's horses died.
May 29, 1834 ~ Thursday


May the 29th.
Having to buy a horse, we were detained
untill near noon. There was some murmuring
among the brotherin; many wished to go
on, and not tarry with the rest of the company
for the day; and some had already started.
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] sent for them to return, and called the
whole camp together and instructed them
not to scatter. I told them if they went
ahead of the camp in a scattered condition
they whould become weary, lie down on[[Jezeniah B. Smith|his]] tent. The whole scenery was very amus-
ing. Not withstanding our enemies were
continually breathing threats of vialence we
did not fear, neither did we hesitate to
prasecute our journey, for God was with us,
and his angels were before us; and the faith
of our little band was unwavering. We knew
that angels were our companions, for we seen
them. 
May 27, 1834 ~ Tuesday


Tuesday May the 27th

We arrived at the Okaw branch of the
river [[Kaskasia River, Illinois|Kaskaskia]] where we found two log canoo-
es, which we tacked together, and on which
we ferried our baggage acrost the stream. We
then swam our horses and wagons, and
when we arrived at the oppiset shore, the
brotherin fastonned ropes to the wagon
tongues and helped the teams out of the water,
and up the steep bank, some of the brother-
in felled a tall tree acrossed the river, on which they
passed over, and carried some of their baggag
on their backs. While we were passing Gorge
A. Smith discovered a spring which with a
little digging furnished us with an abund-
ant supply of excelent water, which afterwards
received the name of the mormon spring.
This afternoon elder [[Solomon Humphrey III|Solomon Humphry]] an
aged brother of the camp, having becometo [[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]] example, which was right. This evening
Brother [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Amasa Mason Lyman|Amasa Lyman]]
returned from the [[Eugene Township, Vermillion County, Indiana|Eugene]] branch, Indiana,
where I had sent them; with a company of about
a dozen men. The report of mobs which were
continually saluting our rear, caused the brotherin
to be constantly alive to the subject, and about
eleven oclock this evening, our picketed guard
reported that they saw the fires of the mob on
the south east of us. I instantly discovered the
mistake, but wishing the brotherin to enjoy
the scene as well as myself, amediately discharged
my gun which was a signal to call all
men to arms. When the companies were all
paraded, and ready for battle, I pointed them
to the reflection of the rising moon, resting on
points of timber on the east, which gave the ap-
parence of the reflection of the light, of a number
of camp fires. The scenery was most delightful,
and was well worth the trouble of any man
arising from his coutch to witness, who had
never see the like, on the broad prairie before.
This circumstance provered that nearly every
man in the camp was ready for battle ac-
cepte [[Dean Gould|Gould]] (who was not baptized) and cap-
tain [[Jezeniah B. Smith|Jezeniah B. Smith]] who was suddenly
taken with the chollic and did not leavethem alone; dont hurt them, how will the
serpant ever loose its vermin, while the servants
of God possess the same dispasition, and con-
tinue to make war upon him. Men must become
humble before the brute creation, and when
men lose their virtuous dispasition, and seek
to destroy the animal race, the lion and the
lamb can dwell together, and the suckling
child play with the serpant in safety.[&quot;] The brother-
in took the serpants carefully on sticks, and
carried them acrossed the creek. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] exhorted the
brotherin not to kill a serpant, bird, or
animal of any kind during our journey,
unless it was nessary to preserve ourselves from
hunger. I had frequently spoken upon this
subject, when on a certain occasion I came
up to the brotherin who were watching a
squrrel on a tree, and to prove them, and
to know if they whould heed my council.
I took one of their guns, shot the squrrel
and passed on, leaving the squrrel on the
ground. Br. [[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]], who was just behind
came up, picked up the squrrel and said,
"We will cook this, that nothing may be
lost.&quot; I percieved that the brotherin under-
stood what I sayed it for, and in their
practice gave more heed to my percept, thanto bait at a slough, about six miles from
the timber. Having no water to drink, but
sutch as was filled with living animals, common-
ly called wigglers, and we did not like to swal-
low them, we strained them through our
teeth; which saved the life of many a poor
animal. This was the first prairie of any
magnitude that we came to on our
journey; and was a great curiosity to many
of the brotherin, it was so very level that
a deer miles off appeared but a shorte dis-
tance. some of the brotherin started in
pursuit, before they were apprised of their mis-
take. We continued our march, pulling
our wagons through a small creek with
ropes, and came to the house of Willam
Wayne the only settler in the vacanity,
where we found a well of water, which was
one of the gratest comforts that we could
have received, as we were almost famished,
and it was a long time before we could,
or dared to satisfy our thirst. We crossed
the [[Embarras River, Illinois|Embarras river]] and encamped on a
small branch of the same, about one mile
west. In pitching my tent we found, three
[blank] prairie rattle snakes, which
the brothern were about to kill, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] sayed, "letWhile others walked down differant
streets leaving the inhabtants wondering
when that big company whould come
along. 
May 22, 1834 ~ Thursday


Thursday the 22nd. After
traveling through the day, we encamped
on a small stream of water in a
grove near [[Belleville, Hendricks County, Indiana|Blleville]] 
May 23, 1834 ~ Friday


23rd Friday. After
a long days drive we encamped
about four miles from [[Greencastle, Putnam County, Indiana|Green-Castle]]
May 24, 1834 ~ Saturday


24th. Saturday. We crossed the [[Wabash River, United States|Wabash river]]
at [[Clinton, Vermillion County, Indiana|Clinton]] in ferry boats, in very quick
time, and pushed on to the state line
where we arrived at a very late houer in
the evening, and encamped in an oak
opening in [[Edgar County, Illinois|Edger County]], Illinois. 
May 25, 1834 ~ Sunday


May
the 25th, Sunday. We had no meeting
today, but attended to washing, bakeing,
and preparing to resume our journey.
A man in disguise, having on an old
seal-skin cap, came into our camp. He
swore we were gowing up to [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]],
and that we should never get over the Miss-
issippi river alive, It was evident he was a spy,
and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] recollect having see him in Jackson County
Missouri. 
May 26, 1834 ~ Monday


26th, Monday. A very hot day. We
traveled through [[Paris, Edgar County, Illinois|Paris]] and acrosst a
sixteen mile prairie. At noon we stoppedyou; who you call your captain or leader, or sup-
erior to the rest? He answered: Sometimes one
and sometimes another takes charge of the
company: so as not to throw the burden
upon anyone in particular. Their spies
who had come from the west; passed us
several times that same day, and the next.
May 21, 1834 ~ Wednesday


Although threatened by our enemies that we
should not, We passed through [[Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana|Indianapolias]]
May the 21st unmollested. All the inhabitants
were quiet. We had been following the Nat-
ional road since the 18th, where it was traveled
frequently we had to take buyroads, which
were many, and led through thick woods.
At night we encamped a few miles west
of Indianapplias. There had previously been
so many reports that we never should be
permitted to pass through that place, and
that the Governer whould have us dispersed.
Some of the brotherin were afraid we might
have difficulty there, but [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] had told them
in the name of the Lord we should not
be disturbed, and that we should pass
Indianipplas, without the people knowing
it, when we neared the place, many got
into the wagons and seperating some
little distance passed through the city[[Franklin Township, Henry County, Indiana|township]], Henry County, in the beech woods.
May 20, 1834 ~ Tuesday


Tuesday 20th. We traveled through the day,
twenty five miles, and encamped near
[[Greenfield, Hancock County, Indiana|Greenfield]]. Some part of the way the roads
being so bad, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] waded over my boot tops
in mud, and helped to pull through
the wagons, with ropes which were fixed
with an iron hook in the end, which was
hoocked in the tongue of the wagon, and
which was easily managed. While we were eating
dinner, three gentlemen came riding up
on very fine loocking horses, commenced their
inquiry of various ones concerning our traveling
in so large a body. Asking where we were
from, and where we were gowing. The reply
was as usual: some from the state of [[Maine|Maine]];
another whould say, "I am from [[New York|York]] state," some
from [[Massachusetts|Maschusetts]], some from [[Ohio|Ohio]], and some whould
reply "We are from the east." and as soon as we
have done eating dinner, we start to go
west again. They then addressed themselves to
Dr. [[Frederick Granger Williams|Willams]] to see if they could find out
who the company was. The Docter replied we have 
no one in particular. They asked if we had
not a general to take the lead of the company.
His reply was no one in particular; but
sayed they, is there not some one amoungsome extent in others, [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] told them they
whould meet with misfortune, difficulties,
and hinderances, and sayed, "You will 
know it before you leave this place," exhorting
them to humble themselves before the Lord; and
become united, that they might not be scourg-
ed. A very singular circamstance took place
that very night, and the next day, concerning
our teams. On Sunday morning when we
arose, we found almost every horse in camp
so badly foundered that we could scarcely
lead them a few rods to water. The brotherin
then deeply realized the effects of discord. When
I learned the fact, I exclaimed to the brotherin,
that for a witness that God over rulled, and
had his eye upon them, that all thoes
who would humble themselves before the Lord
should know that the hand of God was
in this misfortune, and their horses should
be restored to health amediately; and by
twelve oclock the horses were as kninbles as ever,
with the acception of one of [[Sylvester Smith|Sylvester Smith's]]
horses, which soon after died. 
May 18, 1834 ~ Sunday


Sunday
the 18th. We had preaching as usual, and
the sacrement ^was^ administered. 
May 19, 1834 ~ Monday


Monday 19th.
We traveled thirty one miles, passed through
[[Vandalia, Montgomery County, Ohio|Vandalia]] and encamped in [[Franklin Township, Henry County, Indiana|Franklin]]This evening a court muster was held in
camp for the trial of [[Moses Martin|Moses Martin]] for falling
asleep, on watch. Brother Martin pleaded
his own case; sayed that he was overcome
with fetague, and so overpowered that he
could not keep awake ect., ect. [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] desided that
he should be acquitted, and never go to
sleep again while on watch, which was
sanctioned by the court. I took occasion
from the circumstance to give the brotherin
much useful instruction. 
May 17, 1834 ~ Saturday


Saturday 17th.
We crossed the state line of [[Ohio|Ohio]] and encamped
for the Sabeth just within the limits of
[[Indiana|Indiana]], having traveled about forty miles
that day; our feet were sore and blistered
our stockins wet with blood, the weather
was very warm at night. A spy attemped
to get into our camp, but was prevented
by our guards. We had our sentinals
posted every night every night on account
of spies who were continually striving
to haress us by attempting to steal our
horses, ect. ect., This evening there was a difficulty
between some of the brotherin, and Sylvester
Smith on occasion of which [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] was called
to deside in the matter; finding a rebell-
ous spirit in Sylvester Smith, and tomany of the people, and cattle were
infeebled, yet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|my]] [illegible] words were fulfilled.
While passing through [[Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio
great anxiety was manifested; various
reports of our numbers and designs
having gone before us; some of the
inhabidents inquired of the company
where we were going from, Captin Brigham
Young replied, from every [illegible] place but
this, [illegible] and we will soon be from
this. Where are you gowing? To the
west. We forded the [[Maumee River, United States|Maumee river]]
with our baggage wagons, and most
of the men waded through the water.
Some ten or eleven gentlemen came
over from Dayton to ascertain our
numbers, which they reported at least
six hundred. These gentlemen inquired
of many in the camp where we
were from, and where we were
gowing, and what was our business.
They returned to Dayton and reported
that every man in the company was
a gentleman, and gave a respectful
answer to every question asked, but they
could not ascertain where they were
gowing, and what their business was.bloodshed in that place, and when even
a man of God is in a place where
many has been killed he will feel
lonesome and unpleasant and his spirits
will sink. About forty rods from where
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] made this observation we came through
the woods; we saw a large farm, and
there was near the road on our left a mound
sixty feet high covered with apple trees, and
surrounded with oats; this mound contained
human bones. At dinner time some of the
brotherin expressed considerable fear, on
account of milk sickness with which the
people were troubled dureing our route;
many were afraid to use milk or butter,
and appealed to me, to know if it
was not dangerous; I told them to use
all they could get, untill they were told
it was sick. Some expressed fears that
it might be sold to us by our enemies
for the purpose of doing us injury; I
told them not to fear, that if they
whould follow council, and use all they
could get from friends or enemies it whould
do them good and none should be sick
in consequense of it; and although
we passed through naberhoods where Brother [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] broke his harness;
the brotherin fastened their ropes to his
wagon and drew it about three miles
to the place of encampment on the Sci-
oto, river, while he was riding in his wagon
singing and whistling. 
May 14, 1834 ~ Wednesday


14th Wednesday.
We traveled on to [[Bellefontaine, Logan County, Ohio|Belle Fountain]] where
we discovered refrectory feeling in Sylvester
Smith who expressed great dissatisfaction
because we were short of flour; although
we had used all diligence to procure a
supply, and captin [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]
had previously sent two men ahead
to provide a supply for his company.
May 15, 1834 ~ Thursday


Thursday the 15th. We forded the
[[Mad River, Ohio|Mad river]] and passing through a
beautiful country, encamped a little
west of [[Springfield, Clark County, Ohio|Springfield]]. This night Moses
Morton fell asleep while on centry, and
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] went ant took his sword and left him
asleep. 
May 16, 1834 ~ Friday


Friday the 16th, About nine oclock
while [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]] was riding on a wagon with
brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]], [[Ezra Thayer|Ezra Thair]] and Gorge A.
Smith; we came into a place of thick

felt much deprest in spirits, and lonesome,

May 10, 1834 ~ Saturday


10th. Saturday, We passed
through [[Mansfield, Richland County, Ohio|Mansfield]], and camped for
the Sabbeth in Richfield town ship. About
one hour after we had encamped, elders
[[Lyman Eugene Johnson|Limon E. Johnson]], [[Willard Trowbridge Snow|Willard Snow]] and
a number of others joined the camp
from the north west parts of [[Vermont|Vermont]].
May 11, 1834 ~ Sunday


Sunday the 11th. The camp came
togother for a meeting. The sacrament
was administered. Elder [[Sylvester Smith|Sylvester Smith]]
preached. We were there joined by eight
addional brotherin; in company with
elder [[Elias Benson|Elias Benson]] from Richland and
Stark Counties, most of whom were
Germans. 
May 12, 1834 ~ Monday


12th. We left Richfield
traveled about thirty five miles; passed
through [[Bucyrus, Crawford County, Ohio|Bucyrus]] and camped on the
[[Sandusky Plains, Crawford County, Ohio|Sandusky plains]], at a short distance
from the place where the indians
roasted General Crawford, and near
the indian settlement. 
May 13, 1834 ~ Tuesday


13th. We pass-
ed through a long range of beech woods
where the roads were very bad; in some
instances we had to fasten ropes to the
tongues of the wagons, to draw them
out of the sloughs and mud holes.arranged each man in his respective
company, and assigned his place, and
duty, which was generaly in the following
order, Two cooks. Two firemen. Two tent pitch-
ers. Two watchmen. One runner. Two wagoners
and horsmen. and one comisary. We
purchased flower; baked our own bread; coocked
our own provisions generaly, which were good
but sometimes scanty; and sometimes
we had jonny cake or corn-dodger, instead
of flour bread. Every night before retireing
to rest at the sound of the trumpet
we bowed before the Lord, in the several
tents; and presented our thank and offerings
with prayer and supplications; and at
the sound of the morning trumpet every
man was again on his knees before the Lord,
imploring his blessings for the day. Our
journey was like the ancient Jaredites
pitching our tents by the way. 
May 8, 1834 ~ Thursday


May the 8th. 
After completing our organization by number-
ing our wagons, we commenced our march
toward Zion. The weather was pleasant, and
delightful. We traveled through the day
and pitched our tents in a beautiful
green, at [[Chippewa Lake, Medina County, Ohio|Chippeway]] for the night twelve
miles from [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]]. 
May 9, 1834 ~ Friday


9th. We continuedand nearly all elders, prists, teachers,
or deacons. And as our wagons were
nearly filled with baggage we had
to travil mostly on foot. On the 7 [[Joseph Smith Jr.|I]]
gathered togather all the company
and each one donated what money
he had into one general fund; and we
appointed [[Frederick Granger Williams|F. G. Willams]] paymaster of
the company for the funds thus collect-
ed. The following is the whole list of the
names of the camp, being two hund-
red and five men and five women,
some of whom were not present at the
first organization. (Incert the list; in the
Deseret News Vol. 14 No 1 page 21. [blank])

I asked brother Woodruff for the use of
his sword to carry on the journey
which he readely granted. We now had
in our camp twenty baggage wagons.
I continued to organize the company
by appointing sutch other general
officers as were required, and gave
sutch instructions as were nessary for
the deciplin, order, comfort, and safety of
all concerned. I divided the whole camp
into companies of twelve. Each company
selecting their own captain, who severalyand seal them up to eternal life.
According to appointment on the 1st day
of May 1834 those who were ready left
[[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] for [[New Portage, Medina County, Ohio|New Portage]], their was
but a small po[r]tion of the company
ready. The company that did
starte was composed of over twenty
men, with four baggage wagons.
Wilford Woodruff owned one of the four
teams, and baggage wagons which
he drove. The company pitched their
tents by the way. This first company
tearried with the Church at New Portage
untill the main body arrived from
Kirtland. On the 6th day of May, we
were then fully organized. As the saints
had been robbed of nearly every thing
in [[Missouri|Missouri]], the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] gathered to-
gather clowthing and such nesseries
of life as could be obtained for them,
also provided for ourselves horses, wagons
guns and tents for our journey, also
all sorts of munitions of war, for
self defense as our enemies were threatening
on every side. The history of Joseph sayes,
"My company from Kirtland, amounted
to about one hundred, mostly young menletter and showed it to the brotherin, present
and said, "Did I not tell you [blank] last night
that I would soon have some money and
here it is." On Sunday the 27 of April the
saints met togather and held a testamony
meeting, and many of the elders spoke and
bore their testimony, among the number
was [[Sidney Rigdon|Sidney Rigdon]], [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]],
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]], [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]],
[[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver Cowdry]], and also [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the
Prophet who closed by saying "Brothering we
are laying the foundation of a great work
and you know it not, you comprehend it
not. The work we are engaged in will grow,
spread, and increase untill it will fill the
land: it will go from sea to sea it will
fill the [[Rocky Mountains, United States|Rocky Mountains]]: all nations will
hear it: it will fill its destiny; It is the work of
Almighty God, and he will maintain and
defend it." Wilford Woodruff sayed in his
journal it appears to me there was more light
made manifest in that meeting parta
ining ^to^ the gospel and kingdom of God
than I had ever received from the whole Secter-
rian world. The Prophet Joseph called
the men togather who were gowing up
to Zion before leaving [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]]where he found a few saints; and Wilford
Woodruff accompanied him with Harry
Brown to [[Henderson, Jefferson County, New York|Henderson]] County where he
visited the few saints who had been orginized
in that region of country. His object in
visiting the saints at the present time was to
get the young men and middle aged to
go to [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]] and accompany the [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Prophet]] up
to [[Missouri|Missouri]] for the redemption of Zion. But the
only ones he got to go to Kirtland from northern
[[New York|New York]] was Wilford Woodruff and Harry Brown
[[Warren Ingles|Warren S. Ingllas]] who arrived togather in Kirtland
on the night of the 25 of April 1834, and the first
time they met with the Prophet Joseph Smith,
who invited them to make their home with him
while they stayed in Kirtland, which invertation
they gladly accepted. [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]] and John
Murdock also accompanied them to Kirtland.
The brothering were arriving daily in Kirt-
land, to preprare for their journey. One
evening while Wilford Woodruff, Milton
Homes, and sevral of the brotherin were with
the Prophet in his house he sayed "I want some
money to help fit out Zion and I know that
I shall have it." In the morning Brother Joseph
Received a letter from Sister [[Ruth Daggett Vose Sayers|Vose]] of [[Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Boston]],
containing $250. He took the money out of thehis [[Harriet Benton Wight|wife]] lay beside a log in the woods with a
child three days old with nothing to eat, but he
was ready to go under these strange circumstances.
The services of the two volunters were accepted, and the
Lord opened the way for both of them to get a horse,
saddle, bridle, and outfit to prepare for this tedious
journey of one thousand miles in the depth of
Winter, on horseback to visit the Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]
at [[Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland]], Ohio. On their arrival there, arrival
and laying their situation, and that of the
Saints in Zion; the Prophet inquired of the
Lord, and received that Revelation, Section 103
concerning the redemption of Zion Feb. 28 1834.
(Coppy the revelation.)

The Saints of the Lord 
were required to gather up the strength of the
Lord's [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|house]]. It will be seen in the Revelation
that Joseph Smith and [[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley Pratt]] was to
travel together. [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] and Sidney
Rigdon, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum Smith]] and [[Frederick Granger Williams|Fredrick G. Williams]]
[[Orson Hyde|Orson Hyde]] and [[Orson Pratt|Orson Pratt]], These brotherin
went forth according to the Revelation, to
gather up the strength of the Lords house.
Parley Pratt after traveling with Joseph
Smith a while, traveled alone and visited
[[Richland, Oswego County, New York|Richfield]], Onega County, New York; where he
found [[Azmon Woodruff, b. 1802|Azman]] and Wilford Woodruff;
and held two meetings at their home,The history and travels of Zions

The Saints of God were driven from
[[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] into Clay County
about the 13th of November 1833 on which
night were the signs in the Heavens of the
falling of the Stars, see History of the Church,
Millennial Star Vol. 18 Page 583. After the Saints were
driven to Clay County, they were scattered on the
banks of the of the [[Missouri River, United States|Missouri river]] and in the
woods around. Bishop [[Edward Partridge|Partridge]] called a council
of the Authorities of the Church in Zion and who
called for volunteers of two men to go to Kirtland
to see the Prophet Joseph and ask council about
what course to pursue; and as no one volentered
[[Parley Parker Pratt|Parley P. Pratt]] steped forward and sayed he
would go. Bishop Partridge asked what situation
he was in to go; He sayed he had a coat in
the world, his family [[Eleanor Jane McComb McLean Pratt|wife]] lay sick and destitute
but he was ready to go. [[Lyman Wight|Lyman Wight]] was
the next one volenter; when asked how he was
situated and if he had means to go, he saidand Saviour to the Earth to

The Dreame

I looked and beheld in the
East just above the mountains
a beautiful city in the clouds
of heaven the cloud was
perfectly smoothe and of a bright
pink coler and sloped East
from the bottom to the top
so as to give me a plain view
of every house in the city the
houses was all of a beautiful
cream coler but difered in
sise and workmanship each
house had steaples pointing
to the sky and there was lovely
windows boath in the mane
building and the steaples a bove.
And while I looked I called the
attencion of some one that
was near me to this city
and and I thaught they said no
it is not a city but a fleete ofthe power of God manifested itself among
the whole Preisthood and deception was
imposible and many were destroyed by the
Servants of the Lord, because they could desern
by the Spirit all that were true to the Kingdom.
I saw one man who, when he discovered the power
manifested, he drew near to a brother, and said,
I am a Bishop but it availed nothing, he
had associated with the enemies of the Church
and he met his distruction. I felt the final
triumph had come and I was led to exort
the Saints to gather around and sustain the
authority of god vested in the twelve for in
it rested our Salvation. I lay upon my bed
for some time meditateing upon my dream
I was impeled to arise and write the above
and my prayer was that the Saints may
be awake and not be fainthearted, our
enemies will triumph for a season, but
blessed is he who shall continue faithful to
the end Amen

[rest of page blank]height I could see a great distance, and
the Saints were completely surrounded and no way
of escape apeared. I found myself carried forward
on the back of a noble steed, which caried me over
every barier unhurt, much to the shagrin of those
who oposed the church of God. All at once I beheld
the lightness of a day whose light was beyond the
brightness our days, yet, soft and beautiful to behold
and all apeared hushed. I there beheld men
who ^wonce^ belonged to the "who wonce belonged to the
church" in company with the wicked, they
had joined in helping to build up a
barier or high wall to prevent the escape of
of one Soul, and so well did they gaurd
and cary out their plans that the Saints were
completely surrounded and escape apeared
imposible. I then beheld a large multitude of
Saints gather together they stood very close together
from what apeared to be a pressure from
without, in the midst of the vast multitude
of Saints "who apeared to be clothed in white robes" the
twelve stood up, with our beloved president
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] in their midst, the twelve were
calm but strong in the Lord, and clothed
with power from on high and this power was
made manifest, even to the dividing asunder
of those who were oposed to the Church, then
came a great struggle, and as soon as
the fainthearted and those who had joined the
wicked saw the power of God they feigned
friendship but the day had passed.Friday morning Oct 1st 1880

A dream by [[Thomas Harris|Thomas Harris]] on Thursday
night or Friday morning I awoke at 1/2 past
four on Friday morning.

I dreamt I was
in the midst of a mixed multitude of people
some of whom were anxious and dertermined
to destroy Gods people. I thought I had a
certain work to perform, like unto a mission
which I set about to perform in the face of those
who defied and forbad any effort.  I felt no
fear and I commenced to arise from the earth,
and to proceed with my duty, clothed with
an invisible power.  I felt no pride, but was
very humble before God, the enemies of the
church apeared to gain strength, yea even the
great and mighty of men were engaged, and
there apeared a spirit and power among them
that was very great. I was surrounded on all
sides and I felt, or saw, that the power of the united
States was saught for by all, and the hopes and
thoughts of the hearts of the enemies of the Saints was
great. I felt an invisible power within me, and
I was raised from the earth, in mid air, they "the
enemies of the Saints had power and arose also
their object apeared to be, to surround the Saints
which they apeard to do. I still continued to
rise, and the church apeared to gain power
"unobserved. After I had reached a certainwent to our homes, and stood in groups talking in the streets.
There were many passages of great beauty, that I never saw before,
that have passed from my mind. I can now in my mind, see the
letters, but it is as though a vail was drawn, through which
I cannot distinguish them.
[rest of page blank](think, ye have eternal life) (Judgments are
about to be poured out upon the nations,)
Repent ye, Repent ye, for the Kingdom of
heaven is at hand,) Every bit of the space in the
heavens, was filled with writing, and I thought was seen by every
person in the Hall. I thought I turned and asked some one standing
near, what could be the meaning of this, and if it could be, that
the Savior was to appear. And as I turned, the walls of the building
were written on in numerous places. At the west end, was written,
(And a little child shall lead them, )
and further along, (Except ye become as a little
child, ye can in no wise inherit the Kingdon)
It appeared that the stove pipe was in the center of the room, At
the west end of the house, and on it was written, on the north side,
Blessed are the meek) near the stand, so that the
name would be partly on the stand, was written in a sort of a bracket,
and like the scroll in the heavens:

(Render Obedience to your Leaders)

As I stood looking at this, I saw the name of the Supt. of our
Sunday School written, but in smaller letters. I felt to wonder, why
his name was the only one written, and was deeply mortified on account
of it. I waved my hand towards the name, and he looked, and saw his
name with a feeling of thankfulness. The name disappe^a^red without been
seen by anyone, but the two of us. Every one appeared to be greatly
excited, and very much frightened at the wonderful scene. I
turned and spoke to a friend, wondering if the saints who saw Angels,
In the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland Temple]], felt any of the awe, and fear, which prevaded
this gathering. We all gazed at the writings for some time, and then(A Dream) Dreamed by a Sister
In Franklin

On the night of Oct 8th 1883, I dreamed that
I, with my husband, my parents, and his parents, with
many of our friends, was in the meeting house, attending a
party, where all appeared to be enjoying themselves, more
in social chat than dancing. I was standing alone near
the steps leading to the stand, when I saw one of the brethren
sitting near the first window, on the south side, turn and speak 
to his wife, who was sitting near him. She immediatly called
me, and bade me look out of the window at the heavens which
were filled with writing. I was very much frightened at what I
saw, and screamed, bringing the whole assembly to witness the
scene. I saw in the Central portion of the sky, visible from the
window, a scroll, on which was written in letters, 15 or 18
inches high. The passage, (Enter ye in at the Straight gate)
to the north of this was written, (The law shall go forth out
(of Zion, and the word of the Lord, from Jerusalem,)
also, (Except ye become as a little Child, ye can
in no wise, enter the Kingdom of heaven)
To the south was written, (Prepare ye, Prepare ye, the
(way of the Lord) Zion shall be established
(In the tops of the mountains) The earth is the
(Lord's, and the fulness thereof.) Judgments are
(to Commence at the house of the Lord
also. (The Lord will Comfort Zion.)

These passages with many others, some of which I have never before
seen, were all grouped around the first one given, which was the
only one placed in a scroll, and the others, were in smaller letters,
also I saw, Search the scriptures, for in them yeof fire remained over the Temple Block, giving light
to those who remained below. When any attention was
drawn back again to the mountains, I saw that the young
men and middle aged had been called away upon dif-
ferent missions, and the old men and women and chil-
dren had to do all the farm work, and all those who
were laboring to build up the city of Zion in Jackson
County, had to be sustained from these valleys, with the
exceptions of the remnants of the house of Jacob. The
buffalo and other game had returned upon the plains,
to feed them until they could be taught the art of agri-
culture. The earth in the valleys was sanctified and
cleansed, so that it brought forth in its strength, and
instead of its bringing forth from 15 to 40 bushels pr.
acre, it brought forth from one to two hundred bushels.
The water broke forth in parched ground, and all these
valleys were filled with Saints of the Most High, which
had gathered in from the nations of the earth to be school-
ed in the Temples that are now built ^and that will yet be built,^ to prepare them to
go forth to the Centre Stake of Zion. I saw all this
pass before the eyes of my understanding, and when it
had passed once, it was repeated again, which occupied
about the whole of the night. I turned over and tried to
sleep, but sleep had fled from me, and soon it was
daylight. I was not asleep, but was awake during the
whole time, and I arose filled with the glory of what I
had seen resting upon me.for their protection, and when the enemy had fired their
combustibles, these men, endowed with the holy priesthood,
walked along like sentinels on their posts, and waved
their hands, and the flames, and smoke, and ashes, that
were intended for the destruction of the Saints turned up-
on our enemies, and when this combustible matter was
consumed and the fire and smoke had cleared away, lo!
and behold the enemies of this people were not to be
found. During all this time, our people were laboring
in the Temples day and night, endowing the Elders of
Israel with the fulness of the blessings of the holy priest-
hood, until they had got the number of fifty thousand
endowed. The [[Salt Lake City Temple, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]] in [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]], during this
time, had been completed, and in one of the rooms,
situated in one of the towers, Jesus and [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]], with
their councils, were setting. Then preparations were made
for the fifty thousand to go down to the Centre Stake of
Zion, with Jesus and Joseph at their head, riding in
their chariots of fire; they seemed to be somewhere about
from six to ten rods above the earth. While all these
scenes had been transpiring, the remnants of the land had
gathered in from all quarters East of the Rocky moun-
tains, and some had come from [[South America|South America]], and
when our brethren passed down to the Centre Stake of
Zion, the remnants went forth and redeemed the land
of Zion. I saw the foundation ^of the Temple^ laid there, which had the
appearance of a bright lustre. The chariots or pillarnumber of those that had gone into polygamy for the
principle thereof, had to go to prison, while those that had
embraced if for lust escaped, as the officers appeared
to care nothing about them. I saw no preparation of
any warlike demonstration in the midst of the Saints,
but all appeared to have the spirit of peace and con-
tentment, and when the soldiers came near our borders,
then the United States officers and all the Gentiles were
seized with fearfulness, and left in haste by night and
by day, until they all got outside of the borders of this peo-
ple, and united with the soldiers. Then the army surroun-
ded this people on every side, and there was no possible
way of escape; they then raised their standard and sent
forth a proclamation to all who wished to save their
lives to come to them for protection. About one third
of our men, and as many women as they could per-
suade to follow them, went over to the army and joined
it. Then I saw the preparations commence for the entire
destruction of the Saints, which consisted in their ene-
mies gathering together all the combustible material they
could obtain, making a complete wall all around this
people. It looked to me to be some fifty feet high,
and from six to ten rods wide on the bottom. During
the time of their gathering this combustible material, our
people were laboring in the Temples, endowing men with
the fulness of the blessings of the priesthood, setting them
apart, and placing them along the borders of the Saintsand came to this people in the mountains. Then I saw
many thousands of women and children take refuge in
the timber, hazel rough, ^brush?^ or any place where they could
conceal themselves from the turmoil that was going on
in the States, and when the word reached this people of
their situation, there were hundreds of the Seventies call-
ed upon to go and hunt them up, and bring them
to this people in [[Utah Territory|Utah]]. Then the Government of the
United States patched up their difficulty, and elected
a new congress, which assembled again to do business.
The crusade still continued against the Latter-day
Saints. Our enemies attributed all their troubles to the
Saints, and the crusaders raised such a howl and sent
forth their petitions to Congress, that the first business
they did was to order one hundred thousand of the best
and most able bodied men that could be obtained
to come against us. When this became known to the
Saints, instructions were sent forth for all of the inhabi-
tants of the Territory to gather into valleys, as near as
possible to the Temples, and the people gathered into Salt
Lake, [[Cache County, Utah Territory|Cache]], [[Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah]], and [[Sanpete County, Utah Territory|Sanpete]] Counties, and to [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George]],
until there was a family to nearly every acre of land,
and all the country around was filled with our people,
and water broke forth where before there had been no wa-
ter, so that all the land could be cultivated. I saw also,
that all the old men who had honored their priesthood,
became spry and young again. I also saw that the greaterA Vision,

As seen by [[Newman Bulkley|Newman Bulkley]], on the night of the
8th January, 1886, in [[Springville, Utah County, Utah Territory|Springville]], as related by himself.

I retired to rest about 9 o'clock in the evening.
In a short time I drowsed off to sleep, and it seemed
as if the spirit of my dead wife was hovering 'round
about me. Suddenly I awoke and sleep departed from
me, and the vision of my mind was opened, and I
beheld the members of the Senate of the United States,
while in session, they were hurled from the Hall by
an unseen power; they rallied again, and the second
time were thrown from the the Hall; they rallied the third
time, and were again thrown from the Hall with such
violence that a great number of them were killed; all
those that remained alive had the name of Edmunds
printed in their foreheads. Next I saw a whirlwind
commence in the centre of the House of Representa-
tives, which increased until it frightened all the mem-
bers out of the House, and they then scattered to various
parts of the United States, and the inhabitants of the
city of [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] became frightened, and scattered, un-
till the city became almost desolate. Then I saw a great
tumult commence all over the United States, which
ended in a great deal of blood being shed, and a great
many of the people that had heard our Elders preach,
and had believed what they had heard, but had not had
the courage to embrace the Gospel when they heard it,
gathered up what little effects they could take with them,"The Latter day Saints are being murdered
in the north for the Gospel's sake and those
that are determined to serve God are fleeing
to save their lives. But we are only going to
be driven to [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George]], and there stand still,
for we have been driven all we intend to be
driven, for there we will stand still and see
the salvation of our God or die for Zion's sake."
Then I rode on to the center of [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Cedar City]] and
there saw the last man putting the last half
bushel of wheat into his wagon which just
filled the wagon box, and bringing a spirit
of peace to me, thinking that he was the last
man, and that he would be out in a few moments
and that then all the people of Cedar City would
be safe on the road to St. George.

I rode quickly back and overtook the train
outside of town. A thought came to me, wondering
if the Saints would come from towns beyond
Cedar. I turned the head of my horse eastward
&amp; put the spurs to him, and as quick as thought
I was on the peak of the highest mountain
with my horse turned around and looking
north. I saw the road, as it were as straight,
as an arrow from Cedar City to [[Summit, Iron County, Utah Territory|Summit]],
filled with teams, wagons, horsemen &amp; people
walking afoot, just about to enter Cedar City
when Cedar City people had just left on the
southern side. Thus ended my vision.

[[James Booth|James Booth]]then I walked the fence and put my feet on 
the south side of the canal to go to [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George]].
At this moment I awoke and heard the clock
strike six (6) in the morning, trembling and in
great fear at what I had seen and heard. I told
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] all that had transpired and in a few
moments I was again in the society of my Redeemer.
He showed me some things in his hands which he
moved about and said: "Thou seest these, but
the time is up now, but behold, I will show
more unto thee at another time."

All this was given unto me on the night, when
Pres. [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]] staid at Belleview
for the last time during Bro. Smith's life on
their way to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]].

Part II

In Midsummer of the same year, at St. George,
the following vision was given me:

I found myself on horse back traveling between
[[Hamilton Fort, Iron County, Utah Territory|Hamilton's Fort]] and [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Cedar City]] going north.
When I arrived about a mile south of Cedar
City, I began to meet the Latter day Saints of
Cedar City coming south with their teams
of horses, mules, oxen, horse men and people
walking afoot 6 and 8 abreast old &amp; young,
male &amp; female between the hind end of a
wagon and the head of a team.  They were walking
because their wagons were overloaded with grain
&amp; provisions. I rode along the side of the train
towards Cedar City. I noticed the people were
very cheerful.  The spirit said to me:among the dead and said: "Well, if you are, look
here, by hell, if you ain't out of this in two minutes
we will serve you like these." pointing at the
same time with his right hand towards the slain.
I stepped across the gutter and noticed the sun
was standing in midheaven.

The spirit said: "[[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St George]] is the best place for you."
I started to walk and when I did so I noticed, about
3 blocks square of buildings south of this scene
had entirely disappeared. So I walked across
the ground in a southeasterly direction and passed
the Elephant store and came to the state road.
I had not gone far south, when I came to a broad
canal. I looked for a bridge, then a footbridge, but
could not find any. And the only way of crossing it
was, by holding on to a fence rail, which reached
across the canal on the opposite side of the road.
The moment I stepped on the rail to start across,
my Redeemer stood upon the road ground I
had just left. As we were looking at each other
earnestly, he said: "Thou wouldst not be afraid
to die for my sake, wouldst though?" Which caused
me to tremble and shake before him and say:
"O Lord, thou knowest all things, but I do pray thee,
to give me of thy holy spirit, that I may be found true
&amp; faithful in all things, even unto death."  He again
said: "Thou wouldst not be afraid to die for
my sake, wouldst thou?" And I again answered
"O Lord, thou knowest all things, but I pray
thee to give me of Thy holy Spirit, that I may be
found true &amp; faithful in all things, even unto death."I thought these were very strange proceedings,
turning to leave, I found that an acquaintance
of mine from [[England|England]] was standing at my right
side. This was a surprise to me and I said to
him: "Helloa, Bob, what are you doing here?"  his
name being Robert. He said: "I am looking on
like the rest of the people." We turned the corner
and walked along Brigham street until we
arrived at Main street. Then continued south
until Kimball &amp; Lawrence's corner. When we came
to the corner, I saw at once that the soliders and
^civilian^ gentiles were butchering our brethren above
mentioned. It seemed, they had attached the instru-
ments to their bodies and were pumping the
blood out of them, it running into the gutter,
where it froze, until it resembled beef suet in
consistency but in color like blood. The first
man I noticed as being active in butchering was
a gentile. He arose from among those whom he had
slain and the blood was dripping from his fingers ends
and from his coattails as though he had been lifted
out of a pool of blood. I walked along the edge ot the
sidewalk between the dead &amp; the gutter. As I started,
this friend of mine said: "We are Mormons why don't
you kill us?" Which brought a great fear over me,
and I thought of leaving him, for I felt I had not
courage to look over either my right or left shoulder.
When I came to the other end of the row of dead
bodies, he was also there with me and again said
"We are Mormons, why don't you kill us?"
Another gentile arose from a stooping posture fromon the other side of the vail. But the brethren
do not know it, for none see them but you."
At this moment the soldiers came and began
to th take the brethren and lead them on the
sidewalk in front of the stores and before the
instruments above attended to. I soon began to
hear the cries and groans of agony of the brethren
and thought I would take a walk eastward
towards the theatre to see what was going on in
another part of the [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]]. As I turned the corner of
the theatre I found the streets filled with gropups of
gentiles. Fences were broken down and people were
standing in the lots the same as in the streets.
When I arrived at the Gardeau house I saw
a large prison standing in place thereof. The
corner facing the street corner was of octagon
shape with a large door some 8 or 10 feet above ground
without steps leading thereto. I was [saw] an iron door
with visible one inch square headed both from
top to bottom fastened in diamond shape. Whilst
looking at this door, a stout heavy built man
opened it from within and stood on the threshhold
and said these words: They are just doing right, to
kill these damn Mormons, damn them, they ought
to be killed every last one of them. Some of my
family have been silly enough to join them and if
they kill them, damn them, serves them right.
They preach of a resurrection and a hereafter.
I believe when a man is dead, he is done with,
and to hell with him." At the same time
turning about and slamming the door behind him.Vision.

In the winter of 1874 my mind was very much
exercised in regard to the parable of the 12 olive
trees; doct. &amp; cov. page 279 old ed.

After a social chat with father Johnson of Belleview
Cave Co. one evening upon this subject we retired.
The vision began by finding myself walking up Main
street, [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] going north. When I arrived at
Z. C. M. I. drug store, I saw coming from the direction
of the Salt Lake Theatre, soldiers on horse back, two
abreast going westward. They had instruments of
destruction in their arms reaching almost to the
ground, similar in appearance to english fire
engines made of fine brass. They commenced to dis-
mount opposite Kimball &amp; Lawrence's corner and
placed these instruments on the street opposite the
stores extending from Kimball's corner to market
square. I passed them and went unto the market
square. I saw the yard of a large prison with two
iron gates towards me, which were very high, with
arched spiked tops and arched brickwork above
the gates. Between the gates &amp; myself were from
two to three hundred (2â300) of our brethren;
all without hats.  They were very clean &amp; appeared
very cheerful.  In their midst I beheld the prophet
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]].  They looked very much
pleased and their complexion was very much fairer
than any of the rest. The spirit said to me:
"There is brother Joseph &amp; Hiram, they have come
to meet &amp; welcome the spirits of these, your brethrenThese papers have been examined by
me E L W

These are visions.On the Night of the 10 of Aug 1885
I dreamed I was in the Celestial Kingdom of
God with the Saints, and all persons
there were exalted to blessings according
to ther faithfulness or deprived of
them according to their transgressions
some were far more exalted than others

During the night of Aug 9 I had the
following dream I was in a large meeting
of the Latter Day Saints President
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] &amp; [[George Quayle Cannon|Cannon]] were present some
strange man came into the congregation
and handed me a large sheet of papyrus
of important records I did not know what
they contained soon President [[Brigham Young|Young]] came
along with a Mormon car that the
presidency, Twelve, and Leading Men were to
get into. We were all required to take our
Temple Clothing with us President Young also
presented us with a lock that we were to lock
up the car with and he wrote on the
bolt, that we was to lock the car with

Sunday, November 24th 1889 at [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake City]], Utah

Thus saith the Lord, to my servant Wilford, I the
Lord, have heard thy prayers and thy request, and will
answer thee by the voice of my spirit. Thus saith the
Lord, unto my servants the Presidency of my Church, who
hold the Keys of the Kingdom of God on the earth, I the
Lord hold the destiny of the Courts in your midst, and the
destiny of this nation, and all the nations of the earth in
mine own hands; and all that I have revealed, and
promised, and decreed concerning the generation in
which you live, shall come to pass, and no power shall
stay my hand. Let not my Servants who are called
to the Presidency of my Church, deny my word or my
law, which concerns the salvation of the children
of men. Let them pray for the Holy Spirit, which
shall be given them to guide them in their acts. Place
not yourselves in jeopardy to your enemies by
promise; your enemies seek your distruction and
the distruction of my people. If the Saints willRevelation given to

[[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]]And I could not help giving utterance aloud to the expression
I am glad I stood a moment longer and [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] took the
company aside into what appeared like a cellar &amp; spread before them
the most beautiful luxuriant feast that I ever beheld from this time
the Saints were of one heart &amp; mind &amp; the power &amp; glory of God
rested upon them &amp; the elements &amp; all things were subject unto them
and as I was contemplating upon the scenery through which we had
past, the spirit of the Lord came upon me &amp; showed me through it, that
it was necessary for the Saints to pass through just such straightened
circumstances &amp; trials in order to sift out those who are unworthy to
enjoy the blessings that we now enjoy, the cloud that first hung
over the Saints rolled off upon the inhabitants of the United States
with tenfold vengance, such scenes of vengance famine pestilance and
bloodshed followed that it is out of my power to describe. The Church
started South for [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] Missouri, myself &amp; some other
Brethren were passing through a lane in Jackson Co, we saw a
Missouri mobacratt vary malicious in appearance coming towards us
on the opposite side of the road &amp; when about opposite to us his eye
caught ours he immediately withered &amp; disappeared.  From the [ink blot]
of the dark Cloud to the close of the vision I have no recollection
of seeing any women or children. Amen

Vision of Farnsworth

[rest of page blank]Vision of Farnsworth

On a clear still day about 1 oclock pm about the time of the ringing
of the bell for the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] Hands to commence work in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]
All of a sudden the Heavens assumed a heavy gloomy appearance
And the Saints in Nauvoo appeared to be all in confusion and
downcast countenance and the 12 Apostles commenced councelling the
Saints to gather in from the varioust settlements and prepair for a long
journey to the west. They gathered together started in waggons as far as
the eye could reach, after travelling some time the journey seemed
to be accomplished and much easier than was anticipated &amp; matters
seemed to assome a bright &amp; more cheerful appearance and prosper-
ity attended the Saints for a short season. All on a sudden a terrible
dark cloud arose &amp; continued to thicken and grow more terrible
in appearance untill every ray of hope or prospect of escape seemed
to be cut off. At this time the Authorities of the Church all appeared
to be absent. [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] came in suddenly into our midst followed
by the Twelve, &amp; commenced councilling the Saints to be of good cheer
&amp; see the Salvation of the Lord, but by the dark &amp; gloomy appearance of
some the advise seemed to have but little effect &amp; the first I knew
the Church seemed to be gathered together in a circle with 3 strong
Iron Bands around it &amp; Brigham leading the 12 with small
Mallets in their hands like masons mallets they were passing around tapping
and driveing the hoops. This was the first time I noticed the absence of
[[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]] &amp; [[Hyrum Smith|Hyram Smith]], and I felt troubled &amp; weighed down on
account of it while Brigham &amp; the 12 were thus driving &amp; tightning
the hoops they appeared to have the most determined, fierce, resolute,
countenances I ever beheld &amp; the Saints seemed to be pressed almost
beyound endurance actually driven to the point of starvation and the
heavens assumed a terrible asspect at this time. A thought aroused my
mind and I was just about giving the utterance to the expression that the Saints
could not stand it any longer when all of a sudden they burst the hoops
asunder and sumthing more than half of them ran like frightened sheep
Just at this moment the black cloud that overspread the Heavens burst instantly
over our heads and the countenances of the Authorities that before had
seemed tyranical &amp; oppressive instantly changed to the most heavanly
&amp; pleasant appearance all our troubles were instantly banishedwas.  I have never looked into the
matter enough to know that.

After some further conversation
which was of an unimportant character,
Marshal [[Frank Dyer|Dyer]] retired.
[rest of page blank]you.

President Woodruff â Thank you.
Of course, that is a favor; it is a 
privilege to walk out in open day-
light and among our people.

Marshal [[Frank Dyer|Dyer]] â Well, I don't know
as there has ever been an attempt for
your arrest. I have bothered less
about your case than any other
man of prominence in the [[Utah Territory|Territory]].
I didn't even know who your familythat stood in their way and send
them off somewhere.  On the other 
hand, your people were just as stubborn,
and nobody seemed disposed to meet
halfway.

[[Frank Dyer|I]] will tell you, that, as far as
you are concerned,âI have no hesita-
tion in the world; I would tell it to 
you on Main Street just as soon as
I would here â you shall not be
arrested, unless the Grand Jury shall
take the case up themselves and indictnow we will punish him so that
it will be a terror to him. Others
have done different; but we are not re-
sponsible for what others did before.

The facts are, that in [[Frank Dyer|my]] opinion all
the people here lost their heads the 
last two years. I think that the Gentiles,
encouraged with a little favors that
dropped to them; got wild and ex-
pected that in a moment they were 
going to be able to pick up everybodybe passed. [[Frank Dyer|I]] think the thing has
been trifled with, and the government 
has been criminally liable.  I have
always taken the view that inasmuch
as there are so many people who have
gone into polygamy when they con-
scientiously believed it was right, and
there was no specific law against
it â I say in a case of that kind
that if Congress had said we will let
you go ahead and won't fall out about
it; but any fellow that goes into itit qut quite a privilege to get out and
look on the faces of the people at Conference.

Marshal [[Frank Dyer|Dyer]] â There is no need for 
you to be uneasy.

President Woodruff â I really don't 
think it would add particularly to the 
interest of our great government to take
a shut up, for marrying a wife or two,
an old man 80 years of age.

Marshal Dyer â Of course, that is a 
long discussion.  I have always taken
the stand that stringent laws ought toPresident's Office,
