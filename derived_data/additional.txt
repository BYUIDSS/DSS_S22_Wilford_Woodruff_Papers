The Dreame

I looked and beheld in the
East just above the mountains
a beautiful city in the clouds
of heaven the cloud was
perfectly smoothe and of a bright
pink coler and sloped East
from the bottom to the top
so as to give me a plain view
of every house in the city the
houses was all of a beautiful
cream coler but difered in
sise and workmanship each
house had steaples pointing
to the sky and there was lovely
windows boath in the mane
building and the steaples a bove.
And while I looked I called the
attencion of some one that
was near me to this city
and and I thaught they said no
it is not a city but a fleete ofthe power of God manifested itself among
the whole Preisthood and deception was
imposible and many were destroyed by the
Servants of the Lord, because they could desern
by the Spirit all that were true to the Kingdom.
I saw one man who, when he discovered the power
manifested, he drew near to a brother, and said,
I am a Bishop but it availed nothing, he
had associated with the enemies of the Church
and he met his distruction. I felt the final
triumph had come and I was led to exort
the Saints to gather around and sustain the
authority of god vested in the twelve for in
it rested our Salvation. I lay upon my bed
for some time meditateing upon my dream
I was impeled to arise and write the above
and my prayer was that the Saints may
be awake and not be fainthearted, our
enemies will triumph for a season, but
blessed is he who shall continue faithful to
the end Amen

[rest of page blank]height I could see a great distance, and
the Saints were completely surrounded and no way
of escape apeared. I found myself carried forward
on the back of a noble steed, which caried me over
every barier unhurt, much to the shagrin of those
who oposed the church of God. All at once I beheld
the lightness of a day whose light was beyond the
brightness our days, yet, soft and beautiful to behold
and all apeared hushed. I there beheld men
who ^wonce^ belonged to the "who wonce belonged to the
church" in company with the wicked, they
had joined in helping to build up a
barier or high wall to prevent the escape of
of one Soul, and so well did they gaurd
and cary out their plans that the Saints were
completely surrounded and escape apeared
imposible. I then beheld a large multitude of
Saints gather together they stood very close together
from what apeared to be a pressure from
without, in the midst of the vast multitude
of Saints "who apeared to be clothed in white robes" the
twelve stood up, with our beloved president
[[John Taylor, b. 1808|John Taylor]] in their midst, the twelve were
calm but strong in the Lord, and clothed
with power from on high and this power was
made manifest, even to the dividing asunder
of those who were oposed to the Church, then
came a great struggle, and as soon as
the fainthearted and those who had joined the
wicked saw the power of God they feigned
friendship but the day had passed.Friday morning Oct 1st 1880

A dream by [[Thomas Harris|Thomas Harris]] on Thursday
night or Friday morning I awoke at 1/2 past
four on Friday morning.

I dreamt I was
in the midst of a mixed multitude of people
some of whom were anxious and dertermined
to destroy Gods people. I thought I had a
certain work to perform, like unto a mission
which I set about to perform in the face of those
who defied and forbad any effort.  I felt no
fear and I commenced to arise from the earth,
and to proceed with my duty, clothed with
an invisible power.  I felt no pride, but was
very humble before God, the enemies of the
church apeared to gain strength, yea even the
great and mighty of men were engaged, and
there apeared a spirit and power among them
that was very great. I was surrounded on all
sides and I felt, or saw, that the power of the united
States was saught for by all, and the hopes and
thoughts of the hearts of the enemies of the Saints was
great. I felt an invisible power within me, and
I was raised from the earth, in mid air, they "the
enemies of the Saints had power and arose also
their object apeared to be, to surround the Saints
which they apeard to do. I still continued to
rise, and the church apeared to gain power
"unobserved. After I had reached a certainwent to our homes, and stood in groups talking in the streets.
There were many passages of great beauty, that I never saw before,
that have passed from my mind. I can now in my mind, see the
letters, but it is as though a vail was drawn, through which
I cannot distinguish them.
[rest of page blank](think, ye have eternal life) (Judgments are
about to be poured out upon the nations,)
Repent ye, Repent ye, for the Kingdom of
heaven is at hand,) Every bit of the space in the
heavens, was filled with writing, and I thought was seen by every
person in the Hall. I thought I turned and asked some one standing
near, what could be the meaning of this, and if it could be, that
the Savior was to appear. And as I turned, the walls of the building
were written on in numerous places. At the west end, was written,
(And a little child shall lead them, )
and further along, (Except ye become as a little
child, ye can in no wise inherit the Kingdon)
It appeared that the stove pipe was in the center of the room, At
the west end of the house, and on it was written, on the north side,

name would be partly on the stand, was written in a sort of a bracket,
and like the scroll in the heavens:

As I stood looking at this, I saw the name of the Supt. of our
Sunday School written, but in smaller letters. I felt to wonder, why
his name was the only one written, and was deeply mortified on account
of it. I waved my hand towards the name, and he looked, and saw his
name with a feeling of thankfulness. The name disappe^a^red without been
seen by anyone, but the two of us. Every one appeared to be greatly
excited, and very much frightened at the wonderful scene. I
turned and spoke to a friend, wondering if the saints who saw Angels,
In the [[Kirtland Temple, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio|Kirtland Temple]], felt any of the awe, and fear, which prevaded
this gathering. We all gazed at the writings for some time, and then(A Dream) Dreamed by a Sister
In Franklin

On the night of Oct 8th 1883, I dreamed that
I, with my husband, my parents, and his parents, with
many of our friends, was in the meeting house, attending a
party, where all appeared to be enjoying themselves, more
in social chat than dancing. I was standing alone near
the steps leading to the stand, when I saw one of the brethren
sitting near the first window, on the south side, turn and speak 
to his wife, who was sitting near him. She immediatly called
me, and bade me look out of the window at the heavens which
were filled with writing. I was very much frightened at what I
saw, and screamed, bringing the whole assembly to witness the
scene. I saw in the Central portion of the sky, visible from the
window, a scroll, on which was written in letters, 15 or 18
inches high. The passage, (Enter ye in at the Straight gate)
to the north of this was written, (The law shall go forth out
(of Zion, and the word of the Lord, from Jerusalem,)
also, (Except ye become as a little Child, ye can
in no wise, enter the Kingdom of heaven)
To the south was written, (Prepare ye, Prepare ye, the
(way of the Lord) Zion shall be established
(In the tops of the mountains) The earth is the
(Lord's, and the fulness thereof.) Judgments are
(to Commence at the house of the Lord
also. (The Lord will Comfort Zion.)

These passages with many others, some of which I have never before
seen, were all grouped around the first one given, which was the
only one placed in a scroll, and the others, were in smaller letters,
also I saw, Search the scriptures, for in them yeof fire remained over the Temple Block, giving light
to those who remained below. When any attention was
drawn back again to the mountains, I saw that the young
men and middle aged had been called away upon dif-
ferent missions, and the old men and women and chil-
dren had to do all the farm work, and all those who
were laboring to build up the city of Zion in Jackson
County, had to be sustained from these valleys, with the
exceptions of the remnants of the house of Jacob. The
buffalo and other game had returned upon the plains,
to feed them until they could be taught the art of agri-
culture. The earth in the valleys was sanctified and
cleansed, so that it brought forth in its strength, and
instead of its bringing forth from 15 to 40 bushels pr.
acre, it brought forth from one to two hundred bushels.
The water broke forth in parched ground, and all these
valleys were filled with Saints of the Most High, which
had gathered in from the nations of the earth to be school-
ed in the Temples that are now built ^and that will yet be built,^ to prepare them to
go forth to the Centre Stake of Zion. I saw all this
pass before the eyes of my understanding, and when it
had passed once, it was repeated again, which occupied
about the whole of the night. I turned over and tried to
sleep, but sleep had fled from me, and soon it was
daylight. I was not asleep, but was awake during the
whole time, and I arose filled with the glory of what I
had seen resting upon me.for their protection, and when the enemy had fired their
combustibles, these men, endowed with the holy priesthood,
walked along like sentinels on their posts, and waved
their hands, and the flames, and smoke, and ashes, that
were intended for the destruction of the Saints turned up-
on our enemies, and when this combustible matter was
consumed and the fire and smoke had cleared away, lo!
and behold the enemies of this people were not to be
found. During all this time, our people were laboring
in the Temples day and night, endowing the Elders of
Israel with the fulness of the blessings of the holy priest-
hood, until they had got the number of fifty thousand
endowed. The [[Salt Lake City Temple, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]] in [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]], during this
time, had been completed, and in one of the rooms,
situated in one of the towers, Jesus and [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]], with
their councils, were setting. Then preparations were made
for the fifty thousand to go down to the Centre Stake of
Zion, with Jesus and Joseph at their head, riding in
their chariots of fire; they seemed to be somewhere about
from six to ten rods above the earth. While all these
scenes had been transpiring, the remnants of the land had
gathered in from all quarters East of the Rocky moun-
tains, and some had come from [[South America|South America]], and
when our brethren passed down to the Centre Stake of
Zion, the remnants went forth and redeemed the land
of Zion. I saw the foundation ^of the Temple^ laid there, which had the
appearance of a bright lustre. The chariots or pillarnumber of those that had gone into polygamy for the
principle thereof, had to go to prison, while those that had
embraced if for lust escaped, as the officers appeared
to care nothing about them. I saw no preparation of
any warlike demonstration in the midst of the Saints,
but all appeared to have the spirit of peace and con-
tentment, and when the soldiers came near our borders,
then the United States officers and all the Gentiles were
seized with fearfulness, and left in haste by night and
by day, until they all got outside of the borders of this peo-
ple, and united with the soldiers. Then the army surroun-
ded this people on every side, and there was no possible
way of escape; they then raised their standard and sent
forth a proclamation to all who wished to save their
lives to come to them for protection. About one third
of our men, and as many women as they could per-
suade to follow them, went over to the army and joined
it. Then I saw the preparations commence for the entire
destruction of the Saints, which consisted in their ene-
mies gathering together all the combustible material they
could obtain, making a complete wall all around this
people. It looked to me to be some fifty feet high,
and from six to ten rods wide on the bottom. During
the time of their gathering this combustible material, our
people were laboring in the Temples, endowing men with
the fulness of the blessings of the priesthood, setting them
apart, and placing them along the borders of the Saintsand came to this people in the mountains. Then I saw
many thousands of women and children take refuge in
the timber, hazel rough, ^brush?^ or any place where they could
conceal themselves from the turmoil that was going on
in the States, and when the word reached this people of
their situation, there were hundreds of the Seventies call-
ed upon to go and hunt them up, and bring them
to this people in [[Utah Territory|Utah]]. Then the Government of the
United States patched up their difficulty, and elected
a new congress, which assembled again to do business.
The crusade still continued against the Latter-day
Saints. Our enemies attributed all their troubles to the
Saints, and the crusaders raised such a howl and sent
forth their petitions to Congress, that the first business
they did was to order one hundred thousand of the best
and most able bodied men that could be obtained
to come against us. When this became known to the
Saints, instructions were sent forth for all of the inhabi-
tants of the Territory to gather into valleys, as near as
possible to the Temples, and the people gathered into Salt
Lake, [[Cache County, Utah Territory|Cache]], [[Utah County, Utah Territory|Utah]], and [[Sanpete County, Utah Territory|Sanpete]] Counties, and to [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George]],
until there was a family to nearly every acre of land,
and all the country around was filled with our people,
and water broke forth where before there had been no wa-
ter, so that all the land could be cultivated. I saw also,
that all the old men who had honored their priesthood,
became spry and young again. I also saw that the greaterA Vision,

As seen by [[Newman Bulkley|Newman Bulkley]], on the night of the
8th January, 1886, in [[Springville, Utah County, Utah Territory|Springville]], as related by himself.

I retired to rest about 9 o'clock in the evening.
In a short time I drowsed off to sleep, and it seemed
as if the spirit of my dead wife was hovering 'round
about me. Suddenly I awoke and sleep departed from
me, and the vision of my mind was opened, and I
beheld the members of the Senate of the United States,
while in session, they were hurled from the Hall by
an unseen power; they rallied again, and the second
time were thrown from the the Hall; they rallied the third
time, and were again thrown from the Hall with such
violence that a great number of them were killed; all
those that remained alive had the name of Edmunds
printed in their foreheads. Next I saw a whirlwind
commence in the centre of the House of Representa-
tives, which increased until it frightened all the mem-
bers out of the House, and they then scattered to various
parts of the United States, and the inhabitants of the
city of [[Washington, D.C., United States|Washington]] became frightened, and scattered, un-
till the city became almost desolate. Then I saw a great
tumult commence all over the United States, which
ended in a great deal of blood being shed, and a great
many of the people that had heard our Elders preach,
and had believed what they had heard, but had not had
the courage to embrace the Gospel when they heard it,
gathered up what little effects they could take with them,"The Latter day Saints are being murdered
in the north for the Gospel's sake and those
that are determined to serve God are fleeing
to save their lives. But we are only going to
be driven to [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George]], and there stand still,
for we have been driven all we intend to be
driven, for there we will stand still and see
the salvation of our God or die for Zion's sake."
Then I rode on to the center of [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Cedar City]] and
there saw the last man putting the last half
bushel of wheat into his wagon which just
filled the wagon box, and bringing a spirit
of peace to me, thinking that he was the last
man, and that he would be out in a few moments
and that then all the people of Cedar City would
be safe on the road to St. George.

I rode quickly back and overtook the train
outside of town. A thought came to me, wondering
if the Saints would come from towns beyond
Cedar. I turned the head of my horse eastward
&amp; put the spurs to him, and as quick as thought
I was on the peak of the highest mountain
with my horse turned around and looking
north. I saw the road, as it were as straight,
as an arrow from Cedar City to [[Summit, Iron County, Utah Territory|Summit]],
filled with teams, wagons, horsemen &amp; people
walking afoot, just about to enter Cedar City
when Cedar City people had just left on the
southern side. Thus ended my vision.

[[James Booth|James Booth]]then I walked the fence and put my feet on 
the south side of the canal to go to [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George]].
At this moment I awoke and heard the clock
strike six (6) in the morning, trembling and in
great fear at what I had seen and heard. I told
my [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|wife]] all that had transpired and in a few
moments I was again in the society of my Redeemer.
He showed me some things in his hands which he
moved about and said: "Thou seest these, but
the time is up now, but behold, I will show
more unto thee at another time."

All this was given unto me on the night, when
Pres. [[Brigham Young|Young]] and [[George Albert Smith|Geo. A. Smith]] staid at Belleview
for the last time during Bro. Smith's life on
their way to [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]].

Part II

In Midsummer of the same year, at St. George,
the following vision was given me:

I found myself on horse back traveling between
[[Hamilton Fort, Iron County, Utah Territory|Hamilton's Fort]] and [[Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Cedar City]] going north.
When I arrived about a mile south of Cedar
City, I began to meet the Latter day Saints of
Cedar City coming south with their teams
of horses, mules, oxen, horse men and people
walking afoot 6 and 8 abreast old &amp; young,
male &amp; female between the hind end of a
wagon and the head of a team.  They were walking
because their wagons were overloaded with grain
&amp; provisions. I rode along the side of the train
towards Cedar City. I noticed the people were
very cheerful.  The spirit said to me:among the dead and said: "Well, if you are, look
here, by hell, if you ain't out of this in two minutes
we will serve you like these." pointing at the
same time with his right hand towards the slain.
I stepped across the gutter and noticed the sun
was standing in midheaven.

The spirit said: "[[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St George]] is the best place for you."
I started to walk and when I did so I noticed, about
3 blocks square of buildings south of this scene
had entirely disappeared. So I walked across
the ground in a southeasterly direction and passed
the Elephant store and came to the state road.
I had not gone far south, when I came to a broad
canal. I looked for a bridge, then a footbridge, but
could not find any. And the only way of crossing it
was, by holding on to a fence rail, which reached
across the canal on the opposite side of the road.
The moment I stepped on the rail to start across,
my Redeemer stood upon the road ground I
had just left. As we were looking at each other
earnestly, he said: "Thou wouldst not be afraid
to die for my sake, wouldst though?" Which caused
me to tremble and shake before him and say:
"O Lord, thou knowest all things, but I do pray thee,
to give me of thy holy spirit, that I may be found true
&amp; faithful in all things, even unto death."  He again
said: "Thou wouldst not be afraid to die for
my sake, wouldst thou?" And I again answered
"O Lord, thou knowest all things, but I pray
thee to give me of Thy holy Spirit, that I may be
found true &amp; faithful in all things, even unto death."I thought these were very strange proceedings,
turning to leave, I found that an acquaintance
of mine from [[England|England]] was standing at my right
side. This was a surprise to me and I said to
him: "Helloa, Bob, what are you doing here?"  his
name being Robert. He said: "I am looking on
like the rest of the people." We turned the corner
and walked along Brigham street until we
arrived at Main street. Then continued south
until Kimball &amp; Lawrence's corner. When we came
to the corner, I saw at once that the soliders and
^civilian^ gentiles were butchering our brethren above
mentioned. It seemed, they had attached the instru-
ments to their bodies and were pumping the
blood out of them, it running into the gutter,
where it froze, until it resembled beef suet in
consistency but in color like blood. The first
man I noticed as being active in butchering was
a gentile. He arose from among those whom he had
slain and the blood was dripping from his fingers ends
and from his coattails as though he had been lifted
out of a pool of blood. I walked along the edge ot the
sidewalk between the dead &amp; the gutter. As I started,
this friend of mine said: "We are Mormons why don't
you kill us?" Which brought a great fear over me,
and I thought of leaving him, for I felt I had not
courage to look over either my right or left shoulder.
When I came to the other end of the row of dead
bodies, he was also there with me and again said
"We are Mormons, why don't you kill us?"
Another gentile arose from a stooping posture fromon the other side of the vail. But the brethren
do not know it, for none see them but you."
At this moment the soldiers came and began
to th take the brethren and lead them on the
sidewalk in front of the stores and before the
instruments above attended to. I soon began to
hear the cries and groans of agony of the brethren
and thought I would take a walk eastward
towards the theatre to see what was going on in
another part of the [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|city]]. As I turned the corner of
the theatre I found the streets filled with gropups of
gentiles. Fences were broken down and people were
standing in the lots the same as in the streets.
When I arrived at the Gardeau house I saw
a large prison standing in place thereof. The
corner facing the street corner was of octagon
shape with a large door some 8 or 10 feet above ground
without steps leading thereto. I was [saw] an iron door
with visible one inch square headed both from
top to bottom fastened in diamond shape. Whilst
looking at this door, a stout heavy built man
opened it from within and stood on the threshhold
and said these words: They are just doing right, to
kill these damn Mormons, damn them, they ought
to be killed every last one of them. Some of my
family have been silly enough to join them and if
they kill them, damn them, serves them right.
They preach of a resurrection and a hereafter.
I believe when a man is dead, he is done with,
and to hell with him." At the same time
turning about and slamming the door behind him.Vision.

In the winter of 1874 my mind was very much
exercised in regard to the parable of the 12 olive
trees; doct. &amp; cov. page 279 old ed.

After a social chat with father Johnson of Belleview
Cave Co. one evening upon this subject we retired.
The vision began by finding myself walking up Main
street, [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]] going north. When I arrived at
Z. C. M. I. drug store, I saw coming from the direction
of the Salt Lake Theatre, soldiers on horse back, two
abreast going westward. They had instruments of
destruction in their arms reaching almost to the
ground, similar in appearance to english fire
engines made of fine brass. They commenced to dis-
mount opposite Kimball &amp; Lawrence's corner and
placed these instruments on the street opposite the
stores extending from Kimball's corner to market
square. I passed them and went unto the market
square. I saw the yard of a large prison with two
iron gates towards me, which were very high, with
arched spiked tops and arched brickwork above
the gates. Between the gates &amp; myself were from
two to three hundred (2?300) of our brethren;
all without hats.  They were very clean &amp; appeared
very cheerful.  In their midst I beheld the prophet
[[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]] and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hiram]].  They looked very much
pleased and their complexion was very much fairer
than any of the rest. The spirit said to me:
"There is brother Joseph &amp; Hiram, they have come
to meet &amp; welcome the spirits of these, your brethrenThese papers have been examined by

commandments. Pray always and faint not;hearken unto my voice, and the counsel of my
Servants, the wicked shall not prevail. Let my
servants, who officiate as your counselors before
the Courts, make their pleadings as they are
moved upon by the Holy Spirit, without any further
pledges from the Priesthood, and they shall be justified.
I the Lord, will hold the Courts, with the officers of
Government, and the nation, responsible for their
acts towards the inhabitants of Zion. I, Jesus
Christ, the Savior of the world, am in your midst.
I am your advocate with the Father. Fear not little
flock, it is your Father's good pleasure to give you
the Kingdom. Fear not the wicked and ungodly.
Search the scriptures, for they are they which testify of
me; also those revelations which I have given to
my servant [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]], and to all my servants since
the world began, which are recorded in the records
of divine truth. Those revelations contain the
judgments of God, which are to be poured out upon
all nations under the heavens, which includeRevelation given to President Wilford Woodruff.

Sunday, November 24th 1889 at [[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake City]], Utah

Thus saith the Lord, to my servant Wilford, I the
Lord, have heard thy prayers and thy request, and will
answer thee by the voice of my spirit. Thus saith the
Lord, unto my servants the Presidency of my Church, who
hold the Keys of the Kingdom of God on the earth, I the
Lord hold the destiny of the Courts in your midst, and the
destiny of this nation, and all the nations of the earth in
mine own hands; and all that I have revealed, and
promised, and decreed concerning the generation in
which you live, shall come to pass, and no power shall
stay my hand. Let not my Servants who are called
to the Presidency of my Church, deny my word or my
law, which concerns the salvation of the children
of men. Let them pray for the Holy Spirit, which
shall be given them to guide them in their acts. Place
not yourselves in jeopardy to your enemies by
promise; your enemies seek your distruction and
the distruction of my people. If the Saints willRevelation given to
Wilford Woodruff, Nov 24, 1889
[[Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City]]And I could not help giving utterance aloud to the expression
I am glad I stood a moment longer and [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] took the
company aside into what appeared like a cellar &amp; spread before them
the most beautiful luxuriant feast that I ever beheld from this time
the Saints were of one heart &amp; mind &amp; the power &amp; glory of God
rested upon them &amp; the elements &amp; all things were subject unto them
and as I was contemplating upon the scenery through which we had
past, the spirit of the Lord came upon me &amp; showed me through it, that
it was necessary for the Saints to pass through just such straightened
circumstances &amp; trials in order to sift out those who are unworthy to
enjoy the blessings that we now enjoy, the cloud that first hung
over the Saints rolled off upon the inhabitants of the United States
with tenfold vengance, such scenes of vengance famine pestilance and
bloodshed followed that it is out of my power to describe. The Church
started South for [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] Missouri, myself &amp; some other
Brethren were passing through a lane in Jackson Co, we saw a
Missouri mobacratt vary malicious in appearance coming towards us
on the opposite side of the road &amp; when about opposite to us his eye
caught ours he immediately withered &amp; disappeared.  From the [ink blot]
of the dark Cloud to the close of the vision I have no recollection
of seeing any women or children. Amen

Vision of Farnsworth

[rest of page blank]Vision of Farnsworth

On a clear still day about 1 oclock pm about the time of the ringing
of the bell for the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] Hands to commence work in [[Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Nauvoo]]
All of a sudden the Heavens assumed a heavy gloomy appearance
And the Saints in Nauvoo appeared to be all in confusion and
downcast countenance and the 12 Apostles commenced councelling the
Saints to gather in from the varioust settlements and prepair for a long
journey to the west. They gathered together started in waggons as far as
the eye could reach, after travelling some time the journey seemed
to be accomplished and much easier than was anticipated &amp; matters
seemed to assome a bright &amp; more cheerful appearance and prosper-
ity attended the Saints for a short season. All on a sudden a terrible
dark cloud arose &amp; continued to thicken and grow more terrible
in appearance untill every ray of hope or prospect of escape seemed
to be cut off. At this time the Authorities of the Church all appeared
to be absent. [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]] came in suddenly into our midst followed
by the Twelve, &amp; commenced councilling the Saints to be of good cheer
&amp; see the Salvation of the Lord, but by the dark &amp; gloomy appearance of
some the advise seemed to have but little effect &amp; the first I knew
the Church seemed to be gathered together in a circle with 3 strong
Iron Bands around it &amp; Brigham leading the 12 with small
Mallets in their hands like masons mallets they were passing around tapping
and driveing the hoops. This was the first time I noticed the absence of
[[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph]] &amp; [[Hyrum Smith|Hyram Smith]], and I felt troubled &amp; weighed down on
account of it while Brigham &amp; the 12 were thus driving &amp; tightning
the hoops they appeared to have the most determined, fierce, resolute,
countenances I ever beheld &amp; the Saints seemed to be pressed almost
beyound endurance actually driven to the point of starvation and the
heavens assumed a terrible asspect at this time. A thought aroused my
mind and I was just about giving the utterance to the expression that the Saints
could not stand it any longer when all of a sudden they burst the hoops
asunder and sumthing more than half of them ran like frightened sheep
Just at this moment the black cloud that overspread the Heavens burst instantly
over our heads and the countenances of the Authorities that before had
seemed tyranical &amp; oppressive instantly changed to the most heavanly
&amp; pleasant appearance all our troubles were instantly banishedwas.  I have never looked into the
matter enough to know that.

After some further conversation
which was of an unimportant character,
Marshal [[Frank Dyer|Dyer]] retired.
[rest of page blank]you.

President Woodruff ? Thank you.
Of course, that is a favor; it is a 
privilege to walk out in open day-
light and among our people.

Marshal [[Frank Dyer|Dyer]] ? Well, I don't know
as there has ever been an attempt for
your arrest. I have bothered less
about your case than any other
man of prominence in the [[Utah Territory|Territory]].
I didn't even know who your familythat stood in their way and send
them off somewhere.  On the other 
hand, your people were just as stubborn,
and nobody seemed disposed to meet
halfway.

[[Frank Dyer|I]] will tell you, that, as far as
you are concerned,?I have no hesita-
tion in the world; I would tell it to 
you on Main Street just as soon as
I would here ? you shall not be
arrested, unless the Grand Jury shall
take the case up themselves and indictnow we will punish him so that
it will be a terror to him. Others
have done different; but we are not re-
sponsible for what others did before.

The facts are, that in [[Frank Dyer|my]] opinion all
the people here lost their heads the 
last two years. I think that the Gentiles,
encouraged with a little favors that
dropped to them; got wild and ex-
pected that in a moment they were 
going to be able to pick up everybodybe passed. [[Frank Dyer|I]] think the thing has
been trifled with, and the government 
has been criminally liable.  I have
always taken the view that inasmuch
as there are so many people who have
gone into polygamy when they con-
scientiously believed it was right, and
there was no specific law against
it ? I say in a case of that kind
that if Congress had said we will let
you go ahead and won't fall out about
it; but any fellow that goes into itit qut quite a privilege to get out and
look on the faces of the people at Conference.

Marshal [[Frank Dyer|Dyer]] ? There is no need for 
you to be uneasy.

President Woodruff ? I really don't 
think it would add particularly to the 
interest of our great government to take
a shut up, for marrying a wife or two,
an old man 80 years of age.

Marshal Dyer ? Of course, that is a 
long discussion.  I have always taken
the stand that stringent laws ought toPresident's Office,

between President Woodruff and United

After some general conversation,

Well, Mr. Woodruff, I am glad
to see you out and I hope to see more
of you.
